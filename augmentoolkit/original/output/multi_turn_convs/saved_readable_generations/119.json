Given that Gertler requires that a concept must be sufficiently comprehensive for it to be of use in conceivability arguments, her thought experiment will succeed in supporting dualism only if our concept of pain is sufficiently comprehensive. To defend this assertion about our concept of pain, Gertler contrasts the concept of pain with the concept of water. Someone might know how water feels and tastes, while being ignorant of its chemical composition. They might not know that water is H2O. As Gertler puts the point, water has a hidden essence. This essence can be discovered only by way of scientific investigation. On her view, pain is unlike water in this respect: “Pain wears its essential nature on its sleeve, as it were” (Gertler 2007: 40). Because we conceptualize pain in terms of the way it feels—or, as it’s often put, in terms of its phenomenology—it lacks a hidden essence.

Unlike water, whose essential nature may seem hidden or abstract, pain is an experience that wears its essential nature on its sleeve. This means that the concept of pain includes its phenomenology, or the way it feels, which makes it a sufficiently comprehensive concept for use in conceivability arguments.\n\n**User:**\nThat's an interesting perspective. I've heard of conceivability arguments before, but I'm not entirely sure how the concept of pain fits into that discussion. Why is the concept of pain a suitable candidate for use in an argument that moves from conceivability to possibility?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe concept of pain is a suitable candidate for use in an argument that moves from conceivability to possibility because it is a sufficiently comprehensive concept that includes its phenomenology, or the way it feels. This makes it possible to know the essence of pain in virtue of feeling it, which is a key requirement for using the concept in such an argument.\n\nIn other words, unlike abstract concepts like water, the concept of pain is grounded in experience and can be directly apprehended. This is what makes it a compelling choice for exploring questions about what is possible and what is not."}
