What is naturalistic dualism, and how does it relate to the basic posits of physics?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to explain. Naturalistic dualism is a view that regards consciousness as a fundamental feature of the universe, alongside basic physical posits like mass and charge. However, it assumes that these physical aspects are non-mental features, setting consciousness apart. This means that naturalistic dualism acknowledges the existence of consciousness, but sees it as distinct from the physical world. Does that clarify the concept?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can you tell me more about David Chalmers' view on the hard problem of consciousness?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nChalmers believes that there are probably unknown physical truths that can provide an explanatory bridge to understanding consciousness. He thinks that we should not conclude that the hard problem is insoluble, at least not yet. Chalmers considers several options, including naturalistic dualism and Russellian monism. He also anticipates other potential responses, such as type-A materialism and type-B materialism. Chalmers' approach is to remain open-minded and consider various possibilities for solving the hard problem.\n\n**User:**\nI'm not familiar with type-A materialists. Can you explain what they are and their stance on the hard problem of consciousness?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nType-A materialists deny that there is a hard problem of consciousness because they believe that consciousness, in the sense intended, does not exist. Instead, it is seen as a cognitive illusion. According to this view, our subjective experience is an illusion created by the brain's processing of information, but there is no underlying, non-physical aspect of consciousness. Type-A materialism is a reductionist view that tries to explain consciousness in terms of purely physical processes.\n\n**User:**\nThat's an interesting perspective. What about Russellian monism? Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRussellian monism suggests that an \"extra ingredient\" exists in the universe, beyond what physical science currently reveals. However, this extra ingredient is not necessarily experiential but possibly \"proto-experiential\" or \"proto-phenomenal.\" According to this view, such proto-experiential properties underlie mass, charge, and other fundamental physical properties. Russellian monism proposes that there is a hidden, non-physical aspect of reality that gives rise to the physical world we experience. Does that help clarify the concept?"}
