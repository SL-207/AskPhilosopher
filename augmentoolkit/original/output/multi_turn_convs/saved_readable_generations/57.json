Can you help me understand what the relationship between mental states and the world is, according to representationalism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRepresentationalism suggests that mental states represent or are about the world. This means that a mental state's phenomenal character (or \"what it is like\" aspect) consists entirely in its representational character. It's a way of thinking about how our mental experiences relate to the world around us. Is there anything else you'd like to know about representationalism or mental states?\n\n**User:**\nI came across a thought experiment called the Swampman case. Can you explain what it is and what it implies about teleological theories?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Swampman case is a thought experiment about a person who is created in a swamp, but without any evolutionary history. This implies that teleological theories, which suggest that mental states are directed towards objects or goals based on their evolutionary history, are unlikely to be correct. Teleological theories are often based on the idea that mental states have evolved to serve specific purposes, but the Swampman case challenges that idea by suggesting that mental states can arise without any evolutionary history. Do you have any questions about teleological theories or the Swampman case?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about teleological/co-variational theories and how they might apply to the representational character of mental states. Can you explain what the idea behind this is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe idea is to identify the phenomenal character of a mental state with a phenomenon that can be explained naturalistically, by applying teleological/co-variational theories to the representational character of mental states. This would make the phenomenal character less mysterious and more understandable in naturalistic terms. The idea is to apply naturalistic considerations about teleology and co-variation to explain the phenomenal aspect of conscious experience. Does that make sense, or would you like more clarification?\n\n**User:**\nI've also read that some scholars suggest that teleological theories can explain the phenomenal aspect of conscious experience. Can you explain how they propose to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome scholars suggest that teleological theories can explain the phenomenal aspect of conscious experience by applying them to the representational character of mental states, as described by representationalism. This means that the phenomenal character of a mental state can be explained in terms of naturalistic considerations about teleology and co-variation. Essentially, the idea is to use naturalistic theories to explain how mental states represent the world and how that relates to our conscious experience.
