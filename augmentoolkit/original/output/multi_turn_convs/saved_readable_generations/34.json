{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " DISCUSSION Balog’s argument could be seen as an instance of the phenomenal concept strategy for rejecting the zombie argument (and related ­arguments, such as the knowledge argument). This strategy accepts the conceivability of zombies, but explains it in terms of special ­features of phenomenal concepts rather than special features of the ­phenomenal properties those concepts pick out (Stoljar 2005). Balog’s argument also has much in common with a related strategy, on which ­phenomenal concepts are construed as conditional concepts: they refer to physical states if the world is entirely physical, and to non-physical states if the world is not entirely physical (Hawthorne 2002, Stalnaker 2002, Braddon-Mitchell 2003; but see Alter 2007.). Like the phenomenal concept strategy, the conditional analysis strategy defends physical- ism by appealing to claims about phenomenal concepts. But, unlike the phenomenal concept strategy, the conditional analysis is used to challenge the premise that zombies are conceivable rather than the premise that zombies are possible if conceivable. Zombie-argument proponents, such as David J. Chalmers (2007, 2010), respond to Balog’s argument by rejecting her analogy between zombies and yogis. Chalmers suggests that the yogis’ flurg concept differs significantly from phenomenal concepts (or at least from the sorts of phenomenal concepts that are most relevant to the zombie ar- gument). The yogis’ flurg concept is a kind of demonstrative concept: its content could be roughly expressed as “this inner state, whatever that turns out to be.” By contrast, phenomenal concepts do not seem to be demonstrative concepts. For example, the pain concept picks out a state with a certain distinctive phenomenal quality. That state might or might not be physical; but, either way, it must have that distinctive phenomenal quality if it is to be the reference of the pain concept.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the phenomenal concept strategy, and how does it relate to the zombie argument?", "answer": "The phenomenal concept strategy is a way of rejecting the zombie argument and related arguments, such as the knowledge argument.

What is the phenomenal concept strategy, and how does it relate to the zombie argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe phenomenal concept strategy is a way of responding to the zombie argument and related arguments, such as the knowledge argument. It acknowledges the conceivability of zombies but explains it in terms of special features of phenomenal concepts rather than special features of the phenomenal properties those concepts pick out. The zombie argument relies on the idea that zombies are conceivable, and this strategy attempts to account for that conceivability without accepting the argument's implications.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard of the conditional analysis strategy. What is the conditional analysis strategy, and how does it challenge the zombie argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe conditional analysis strategy is another approach to defending physicalism against the zombie argument and related challenges. It construes phenomenal concepts as conditional concepts, referring to physical states if the world is entirely physical, and to non-physical states if the world is not entirely physical. By taking this approach, the conditional analysis strategy challenges the premise that zombies are conceivable rather than possible, thereby reducing the threat of the zombie argument to physicalism.\n\n**User:**\nWhile exploring these concepts, I came across the idea of demonstrative concepts. What is a demonstrative concept, and how does it differ from a phenomenal concept?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA demonstrative concept is a type of concept that refers to a specific inner state, regardless of its underlying nature. For example, the yogis' flurg concept could be roughly expressed as \"this inner state, whatever that turns out to be.\" Demonstrative concepts differ from phenomenal concepts, which pick out states with distinctive phenomenal qualities. In contrast, the yogis' flurg concept doesn't rely on phenomenal qualities; it's more about the specific inner state itself, regardless of whether it has any particular phenomenal character.\n\n**User:**\nYou also mentioned that the yogis' flurg concept differs from phenomenal concepts. How does the yogis' flurg concept differ from phenomenal concepts?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe yogis' flurg concept is a demonstrative concept, whereas phenomenal concepts are not. Phenomenal concepts are tied to specific phenomenal qualities or experiences, whereas the yogis' flurg concept focuses on the inner state itself, without making any assumptions about its phenomenal nature. This distinction is important for understanding the different approaches to accounting for the conceivability of zombies and other philosophical challenges."}
