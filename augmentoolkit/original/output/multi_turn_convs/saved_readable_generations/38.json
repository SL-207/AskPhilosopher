She argues that zombie philosophers could use similar reasoning to show that they themselves have non-physical mental states—and yet, by hypothesis, they do not.

We are asked to conceive of a world that is physically and functionally the same as the actual world, except no one is conscious. In a zombie world, there is a molecule-for-molecule duplicate of you who is “seeing” worlds indistinguishable from the worlds you’re pres- ently seeing—except they have no inner, subjective life at all. If such a world is conceivable, that is partly because we can refer to our ex- periences directly, rather than via physical or functional descriptions. 8 Yogis 45 For example, we can refer to pain not just as a state that has certain physical causes and physical effects—events that have zombie coun- terparts. We can refer to pain more directly, as a state that feels a certain way—that is, a state with a certain distinctive phenomenal quality. Phenomenal qualities are what the zombie world is supposed to lack. Katalin Balog rejects the zombie argument. To show why we should too, she asks us to imagine a world with people that are much like us, except that some of them are yogis.

I was wondering, how does the ability of yogis to detect their brain states in a direct way relate to the zombie world?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a fascinating connection. The ability of yogis to detect their brain states in a direct way suggests that the zombie world, which is supposed to lack phenomenal qualities, may not be as distinct from the actual world as previously thought. In other words, if yogis can directly experience their brain states, it questions the idea of a zombie world that lacks consciousness. Do you have any further questions about the relationship between yogis and the zombie world?\n\n**User:**\nWhat's a key feature of the yogis' concept-forming ability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe yogis' concept-forming ability allows them to detect their brain states directly, without conceiving of them as brain states or physical or functional states of any kind. It's as if they have a direct access to their internal experiences, which is quite different from the way most of us experience the world. Would you like me to explain more about concept-forming abilities and how they differ from ordinary perception?\n\n**User(By reading the safe to know the prior answers):**\nYes, you would not know this, but some people think the zombie world, with zombies having all the sensations of human beings but with no inner life, is one of the main arguments against physicalism. It makes me wonder, what is a key feature of the zombie argument against physicalism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can provide you with information on that. A key feature of the zombie argument against physicalism is the idea that a world without consciousness is conceivable, where there is a molecule-for-molecule duplicate of a person who is \"seeing\" worlds indistinguishable from the actual world, but with no inner, subjective life at all. This challenges the idea that physicalism can fully account for the nature of consciousness and subjective experience. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThis philosopher you're talking about,  who has described the yogis, in how do yogis, as described by a certain philosopher, differ from ordinary people?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYogis, as described by this philosopher, have a special concept-forming ability. They can detect some of their own brain states in a direct way, without the mediation of any physical or functional description. This is what sets them apart from ordinary people, who typically experience the world through a more indirect, conceptual framework. Does that clarify the difference between yogis and ordinary people in this philosopher's view?"}
