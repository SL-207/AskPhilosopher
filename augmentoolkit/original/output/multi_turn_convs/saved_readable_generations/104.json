The key difference is that in a traditional inverted qualia case, the qualia are inverted while the representational properties are kept constant, whereas in Block's Inverted Earth case, it is the representational properties that are inverted while the qualia are kept constant. Does that help to distinguish between the two?\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to understand the difference. Can you tell me more about Ned Block's Inverted Earth argument? What does it aim to vindicate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNed Block's Inverted Earth argument is a philosophical thought experiment that aims to vindicate qualia realism. This is the idea that there are intrinsic mental features of our experience that are not grounded in relations between us and the environment. In other words, qualia realism posits that there is more to our subjective experience than just our perceptions of the world around us. Does that help to clarify Block's argument?\n\n**User:**\nI think so. What does Ned Block take this thought experiment to show?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Block, this thought experiment shows that qualia can't be identified with representational properties, at least as representational properties are typically characterized. In other words, our subjective experiences (qualia) can't be reduced to just our perceptions of the world around us.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Let me ask you about the typical cause of phenomenally green experiences. According to Block, what will happen to these experiences over time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Block, after enough time has passed, the typical cause of your phenomenally green experiences will be interaction with red things. This is a key point in Block's argument, as it highlights the difference between our subjective experiences and our perceptions of the world."}
