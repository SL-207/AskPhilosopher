What is one alternative view about perception, known as relationalism or naïve realism, and how does it recast the issue of whether high-level properties are relevant in perception?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRelationalism or naïve realism is an alternative view about perception that suggests our experience in veridical perception is partly constituted by a perceived object and its properties, rather than representations thereof. This changes the focus from whether high-level properties are relevant in perception, to whether these properties are part of our experience in the first place. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nOne question I have is whether the issue of the contents of perception can be framed without assuming that perceptual experiences have representational contents. Can the issue be framed without assuming that perceptual experiences have representational contents?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to some philosophers, like Siegel, the issue of the contents of perception can be framed without assuming that perceptual experiences have representational contents. Her argument for the Rich Content View could be seen as evidence for this. Do you have any further questions about how perception is understood?\n\n**User:**\nI do have a follow-up question about Siegel's main argument for the Rich Content View. What is Siegel's main argument for the Rich Content View, and how does it complicate the distinction between observation and theory?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSiegel's main argument is that expertise can influence what experience represents. If true, this means that the distinction between observation and theory will not align with the representation of low-level properties on one hand and high-level properties on the other. This idea challenges our traditional understanding of how perception relates to knowledge and reality. Do you have any more questions about the Rich Content View or perception in general?\n\n**User:**\nOne final question I have is what assumption about perceptual experiences is shared by both proponents and opponents of the Rich Content View, and is it a controversial one?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBoth sides of the debate share the assumption that perceptual experiences have representational contents. This assumption is indeed a controversial one, as it has implications for how we understand the relationship between perception, knowledge, and reality. I hope this answers your question."}
