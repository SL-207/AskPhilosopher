{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " In addition to extending transparency to non-visual perceptual ex- periences, Michael Tye has extended it even more broadly to all kinds of phenomenal experience whatsoever. Consider bodily sensations and emotions. On Tye’s view, when you have a toothache, if you try to attend to the pain your attention slips right through to the painful tooth itself. Likewise, when you’re scared of a giant rattlesnake coiled on the trail ahead of you, if you try to attend to your fear your attention slips right through to what you’re scared of; in this case, that’s the rattlesnake itself. How does the transparency thesis support representationalism? We might best see the representationalist as offering an argument that takes the form of an inference to the best explanation. Qualia are meant to be intrinsic features of experience. But if there really were such intrinsic features, features that were over and above functional and representational properties, then we should be able to attend to them. According to the representationalists, the fact that we can’t at- tend to any intrinsic properties of experience is best explained by the hypothesis that there are no intrinsic properties of experience. The phenomenal properties of an experience that have been presumed to be intrinsic properties are really just representational properties.

To help defend this claim, they often point to kinds of experiences where there doesn’t really seem to be anything represented by the experience.

How does the transparency thesis support representationalism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe transparency thesis supports representationalism because it suggests that phenomenal properties of experience are not intrinsic features, but rather representational properties. If there were intrinsic properties of experience, we should be able to attend to them, but the fact that we can't attend to them is best explained by the hypothesis that there are no intrinsic properties of experience, and that phenomenal properties are really just representations of the world.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But I'd like to learn more. Could you explain the transparency thesis in more detail, and how it relates to phenomenal experiences?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe transparency thesis is the idea that, when you try to attend to a phenomenal experience, your attention slips right through to the external object or aspect of the world that is being experienced. For example, when you have a toothache, your attention slips through to the painful tooth itself, and when you're scared of a giant rattlesnake, your attention slips through to the rattlesnake itself. This is why representationalists think that phenomenal properties are just representations of the world, because our attention doesn't seem to be on the properties themselves, but on the thing they're representing.\n\n**User:**\nI see what you mean. But I'm still curious about when this might not be the case. What kind of visual experience is an example of a case where there doesn't really seem to be anything represented by the experience?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA phosphene experience is an example of a case where there doesn't really seem to be anything represented by the experience. Phosphene experiences are the kind of visual experience you have when you push (lightly!) on your eyeball, and the sensation doesn't really seem to be suggesting that there are actually moving, colored expanses out there in the world somewhere. This is in contrast to other visual experiences, like seeing a red apple, where it's clear that there's something being represented by the experience.\n\n**User:**\nI was starting to wonder what might be a counterargument to the transparency thesis. What is one, and how is it used to defend the idea that we can introspectively attend to more than the representationalists think we can?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome philosophers argue that representationalists have not described the transparency thesis properly, and that we can introspectively attend to more than they think we can. They use cases like phosphene experiences, where the sensation doesn't really seem to be suggesting that there are actually moving, colored expanses out there in the world, to argue that our attention doesn't slip through to the world in these cases, and that therefore, we may be able to attend to more than the representationalists think we can."}
