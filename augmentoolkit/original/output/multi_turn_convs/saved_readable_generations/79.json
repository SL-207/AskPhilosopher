How does this differ from something like a glass of water being broken down into its constituent molecules, like H2O?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great analogy to explore. The concept of a glass of water being reduced to H2O molecules is indeed a physical reduction. However, Gertler's view is that pain cannot be reduced to any physical state in the same way. This suggests that pain has a more complex or mental nature that cannot be fully explained by physical properties alone. Gertler's position is that pain is an irreducibly mental state, and that it cannot be reduced to purely physical explanations. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's what I was thinking. But then I started wondering: can pain actually occur in the complete absence of any physical states? If so, what does that imply about the nature of pain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Gertler would argue that pain can indeed occur in the complete absence of any physical states. For example, imagine a scenario where you're dreaming or imagining a painful experience, but there is no actual physical pain occurring. This would suggest that the pain is not reducible to any physical state, and that it must be an irreducibly mental state. This implication would have significant consequences for our understanding of pain and its relationship to the body.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been reading about conceivability arguments, which are used to argue for or against physicalism. What's the assumption underlying these types of arguments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe assumption underlying conceivability arguments is that whatever is conceivable is possible. This assumption is often used to argue that physicalism must be false and that dualism must be true. Conceivability arguments typically involve imagining a scenario where a particular property or experience, such as pain, could exist without any physical basis. If we find it conceivable to imagine such a scenario, we might infer that it's actually possible, which would challenge physicalism. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI see. One of the thought experiments that's often used to challenge physicalism is the idea of waking up with empty eye sockets and a melting body. What role does imagination play in conceiving of such a disembodied state?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nImagination plays a key role in conceiving of a disembodied state, as it allows us to visualize what we would see if our body were to disappear. In this thought experiment, our imagination enables us to imagine what it would be like to experience the world without a physical body. This exercise in imagination can help us appreciate the complexity and richness of conscious experience, and challenge our intuitive understanding of the relationship between the mind and the body."}
