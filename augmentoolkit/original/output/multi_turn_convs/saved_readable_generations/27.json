What is a potential issue with externalism, according to you?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne of the tricky issues with externalism is that it might make us insensitive to some of the features of our mental states, potentially leading us to rationally believe complete contradictions. This is a concern because externalism can make it difficult to understand how we can be certain about the truth of our beliefs, given that our mental states are influenced by factors outside of us.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to learn more about propositional attitudes. Can you tell me about two types of propositional attitudes that can be distinguished?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are at least two types of attitude: those that, in some sense, try to get something right about the world, such as predictions, suspicions, and beliefs, and those that potentially lead the agent to change the world, such as desires, hopes, and wishes. These two types of attitude can help us understand how we engage with the world and how we use our mental states to navigate it.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a helpful clarification. What would be the main goal of attitudes like predictions, suspicions, and beliefs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main goal of these attitudes is to try to get something right about the world. They aim to provide us with accurate information about reality, allowing us to make sense of our experiences and navigate the world effectively.\n\n**User:**\nI've come across a thought experiment about being a brain in a vat. What would be a radical result if you were just a brain in a vat being fed information by a complicated computer, thinking you have a body?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn such a scenario, your belief that you have hands would be false, as your perception of the world would be entirely simulated. This thought experiment raises interesting questions about the nature of reality and how we can be certain about our experiences.\n\n**User:**\nLastly, how does externalism affect the traditional philosophical problem of skepticism about the external world?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExternalism complicates matters by suggesting that even though you might be in a simulated world, your thoughts could still be determined by the real world, making your beliefs about the world potentially true. This challenges the traditional skeptical view that our experiences are entirely subjective and that we can never be certain about the external world. Externalism adds a layer of complexity to the debate, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between our mental states and the world around us."}
