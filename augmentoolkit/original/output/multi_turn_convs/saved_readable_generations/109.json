This can be thought of as the \"aboutness\" of a mental state, where the state is about a particular person, object, or state of affairs. I'm happy to help clarify any terminology for you.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. One thing that's still a bit fuzzy is what counts as an example of a mental state with intentional content. Can you give me one?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the concepts we're discussing, one example of a mental state with intentional content is the belief that Mike Trout plays for the Los Angeles Angels. This belief has intentional content because it represents or is directed at a particular person (Mike Trout) and a certain state of affairs (his playing for that team). Does that example help make the concept clearer?\n\n**User:**\nIt's starting to. I've also heard the term \"intentionality\" used a lot in this context. Can you explain what it means and how it's characterized?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIntentionality is a concept that refers to the representational content of mental states. It's characterized as \"aboutness\" or \"directedness,\" meaning that mental states have a certain content or meaning that they are representing or directed at. For example, a belief about Mike Trout playing for the Los Angeles Angels has intentionality because it represents or is directed at a particular person (Mike Trout) and a certain state of affairs (his playing for that team).\n\n**User:**\nLastly, I've been trying to figure out the difference between having an intention and having intentional content.
