Consider a situation where a person (let's call them \"Donald\") is struck by lightning and vaporized, but a nearby dead tree is transformed into an exact replica of him. What would determine the mental contents of this replica, if it were to exist?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis is a classic problem in philosophy of mind. It's challenging because the replica (let's call it \"Swampman\") would not have an evolutionary history. Therefore, we would need to consider alternative explanations for its mental contents. We can't just assume that the mental contents would be the same as Donald's, since Swampman's brain would be entirely different from Donald's. We'd need to explore different theories of content to explain what Swampman's mental contents would be.\n\n**User:**\nI think I see what you mean. I've been reading about teleological theories of content, and one of the consequences of this view is that a subject's mental content depends on their evolutionary history. Is that right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's correct. One consequence of this view is that a subject's mental content depends on their evolutionary history. This makes sense, because our mental contents are shaped by the functions of our brains and bodies, which are in turn shaped by natural selection.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. But what if a creature has no evolutionary history? Could it have mental contents?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis is a tricky question, but the answer is yes. However, in this case, we would need to consider how mental contents would be determined in the absence of evolutionary history. This is where things get really tricky, because we can't just rely on evolutionary explanations.\n\n**User:**\nI'm starting to see why this is all so mysterious. Why do mental states have the representational content they have?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis is a mysterious question from a naturalistic perspective, because mental states are part of the natural, physical world. To address this question, we need to consider how mental content derives from non-mental aspects of nature. We need to explore different theories of content and see which one can provide the best explanation.\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to get it. What's one way that mental content can be explained?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne way to explain mental content is through teleological theories, which show how mental content derives from non-mental aspects of nature. According to these theories, mental content depends at least partly on functions of the things (or systems) that use or produce those contents, which are usually understood in terms of natural selection (or a related process).
