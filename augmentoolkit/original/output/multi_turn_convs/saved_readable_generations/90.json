How do non-physicalists argue that the phenomenal concept strategy fails?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe phenomenal concept strategy is an attempt to argue that physicalism is impossible, but non-physicalists argue that it merely relocates the problem. They claim that if phenomenal concepts are really so distinctive, then they will themselves be non-physical, which means that the anti-physicalist argument can be reinstated. This is because if the concepts are non-physical, then it's possible to use the same reasoning to argue that the properties they represent are also non-physical, which would support a non-physicalist position.\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand what you're getting at. In the context of the zombie case, what does the concept of \"ideal conceivability\" refer to?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe concept of \"ideal conceivability\" is central to the zombie case. It refers to the idea that we can clearly and distinctly imagine a scenario in which all the physical processes in a person's brain are replicated, but there is no subjective experience or consciousness. Ideal conceivability is often used to argue for the possibility of a world in which consciousness and subjective experience are not reducible to purely physical processes.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what is the zombie case and what does it have to do with the anti-physicalist argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe zombie case is the idea of a world in which all the physical processes in a person's brain are replicated, but there is no subjective experience or consciousness. This thought experiment is used to argue against physicalism because it suggests that subjective experience cannot be reduced to purely physical processes. Non-physicalists argue that the zombie case shows that our concepts of consciousness and subjective experience cannot be explained purely in terms of physical processes. Does that make sense?"}
