THE CASE Consider Inga, a resident of New York City. After hearing about a new exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), she is intrigued and decides to go see it. Having been to the Museum before, she pauses for a moment until she recalls that it is located on 53rd Street. She then heads in that direction. Now, consider Otto, another resident of New York City. Otto is in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, and he has developed various techniques to help him in his daily life. One such technique involves the use of a notebook where he writes down important informa- tion. He carries the notebook with him wherever he goes, is diligent about recording any new information in it, and consults it regularly throughout the day to look up information that he has already re- corded in it.

How has it become associated with a larger research program?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe extended mind thesis is a fascinating topic. The claim made by the extended mind thesis is that cognitive states themselves, such as memory states, can include external entities. This thesis has become associated with a larger research program known as 4E Cognition, which stands for embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended. 4E Cognition is a more comprehensive framework that explores the complex relationships between the mind, body, environment, and culture. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about the extended mind thesis?\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to get a better understanding of it. Can you give an example of a situation where a person's cognitive processes are extended into the external world, such as a notebook or a map?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA great example is the case of Otto, a person with Alzheimer's disease who uses a notebook to record important information and consult it regularly throughout the day to help with his memory and decision-making. In this case, Otto's cognitive processes are extended into the external world, relying on his notebook to remember important information. This example illustrates how external objects and tools can become an integral part of our cognitive processes. Do you have any other questions about this topic?\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to compare two people, Inga and Otto. In what way do Inga and Otto differ in their cognitive processes, despite both being able to find their way to a museum?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nInga and Otto differ in that Inga's cognitive processes are more internal, relying on her internal memory, whereas Otto's cognitive processes are extended into the external world, relying on his notebook to help him remember important information. This highlights the distinction between internal and external cognition, and how external objects and tools can influence our mental processes. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in the different views on externalism. What is the main difference between the externalism of philosophers like Hilary Putnam and Tyler Burge, and the more \"active\" externalist view proposed by Clark and Chalmers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main difference is that Clark and Chalmers' view suggests that the external world drives and constitutes cognitive states, whereas Putnam and Burge's view is more \"passive\" in that it only suggests that mental content is constituted by external features. Clark and Chalmers' view is more radical, arguing that the external world is not just a passive provider of information, but an active participant in shaping our cognitive processes. Do you have any further questions about these different views on externalism?"}
