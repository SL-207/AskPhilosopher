Throughout the many centuries of ­discussion, a number of modifications and refinements have been made to ­Molyneux’s problem (Van Cleve 2007). Diderot suggested it would be better to ask if the subject could visually identify a circle versus a square to avoid problems of depth perception. Leibniz suggested that the subject be told that one of the items being displayed is the cube and the other is the sphere, and be given time to work out which is which. As this suggests, there are really two different questions one might ask: first, whether the person could know immediately by sight alone which was the cube and which the sphere; and, second, whether the information provided by sight, combined with the information recalled from touch, could be used to reason to the correct ­conclusion. The various refinements and interpretations of the problem have led some philosophers to divide it into a group of sub-problems (Mat- then and Cohen 2020). For example, there are questions about the relationship between the way sensory modalities represent space more generally, as well as questions about how vision and touch represent shape (Evans 1985). There are also questions about the relationships between the properties represented by touch and by vision—whether they are in fact the same property.

What modifications were suggested to Molyneux's problem over the centuries?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question. Several modifications were suggested to Molyneux's problem over the centuries. For example, some philosophers proposed changing the task to see if the subject could visually identify a circle versus a square, rather than a cube and a sphere. Others suggested giving the subject time to work out which of two items being displayed is a cube and which is a sphere. These modifications were intended to make the problem more tractable and to see if they could shed more light on the underlying issues. Do you have any further questions about Molyneux's problem?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I'd like to know more about its history. When was a version of Molyneux's problem initially proposed to John Locke?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA version of Molyneux's problem was initially proposed to John Locke in a letter from William Molyneux in 1688. Locke was a prominent philosopher and empiricist, and Molyneux's problem was an attempt to challenge Locke's views on the relationship between sensory experience and knowledge. Locke's response to Molyneux's problem has been the subject of much interpretation and debate among philosophers over the centuries.\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how philosophers have approached Molyneux's problem. What are some of the sub-problems that philosophers have divided Molyneux's problem into?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPhilosophers have divided Molyneux's problem into a group of sub-problems. One way to divide the problem is to ask questions about the relationship between sensory modalities and space. For example, how do we represent shape using vision versus touch? Another way to divide the problem is to ask questions about how vision and touch represent different properties of objects. Philosophers have also divided the problem into questions about the relationships between the properties represented by touch and by vision. These sub-problems are all related to the original question posed by Molyneux, but they help to break down the problem into more manageable parts.\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand the general outline of Molyneux's problem. Can you tell me a bit more about the two different questions that might be asked in relation to it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe two questions are: first, whether the person could know immediately by sight alone which was the cube and which the sphere; and second, whether the information provided by sight, combined with the information recalled from touch, could be used to reason to the correct conclusion. These two questions are closely related, but they are distinct. The first question is about the limits of knowledge based on sensory experience, while the second question is about the possibility of using reason to combine sensory information to arrive at a conclusion."}
