What is the relationship between our phenomenal sense of \"seems\" and our judgments about it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOur judgments about the phenomenal sense of \"seems\" can be distinct from the phenomenal sense itself, and therefore, we can be wrong about how things seem phenomenally. This suggests that our conscious experience and our interpretation of it are not always aligned. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes, it does. But I'd like to know more. What two senses of the word \"seems\" are being discussed in the context of conscious states?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two senses of the word \"seems\" being discussed: a phenomenal sense, which captures the qualitative nature of our conscious states, and a cognitive sense, which reflects the judgments we are inclined to make about those states. Think of the phenomenal sense as the raw experience of seeing a 39-speckled hen, and the cognitive sense as our interpretation of what that experience means. Does that clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nYes, it does. I was wondering, can you distinguish between the phenomenal sense of \"seems\" and the cognitive sense of \"seems\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe phenomenal sense of \"seems\" refers to the qualitative nature of our conscious states, such as what it is like to see a 39-speckled hen. It's the subjective, first-person experience of our sensations and perceptions. The cognitive sense of \"seems\", on the other hand, refers to the judgments we are inclined to make about those states, which can be distinct from the phenomenal sense. For instance, we might judge that the hen has 39 speckles, but our phenomenal experience might be more complex or nuanced than that. Does that help clarify the distinction?"}
