PART V PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF Introduction This section concerns several related problems about persons that are often grouped together under the heading of the problem of personal identity. One such problem concerns the nature of persons: What makes something a person? Another such problem concerns personal identity over time: What makes person A at a given time the same person as person B at another time? Connected with these questions about the nature of persons are also questions about selfhood and the nature of the self. As we saw in the introduction to Part I, contemporary discussions of the mind–body problem in the western tradition often trace to Descartes. In contrast, contemporary discussions of the problem of personal identity in the western tradition tend to trace to a different philosopher living in the 17th century, John Locke. On Locke’s view, a person is “a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself.” This definition leads him to a view of personal identity over time that focuses on continuity of psychology, and, in particular, on continuity of memory.

What philosopher had previously defined personhood in terms of the notion of \"a rational nature\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great starting point. The 6th-century Roman philosopher Boethius had previously defined personhood in terms of the notion of \"a rational nature\". This idea suggests that a person's status as a person is tied to their capacity for rational thought and understanding. Do you have any other questions about this topic?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I do. I've heard of John Locke's work on personal identity. How does he define personal identity over time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nJohn Locke's ideas on personal identity are an important part of the philosophical discussion on this topic. He defines personal identity over time in terms of continuity of psychology, particularly continuity of memory. According to Locke, what makes us the same person over time is the continuity of our memories and experiences. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's a helpful explanation. I've also heard of a thought experiment that's related to John Locke's ideas on personal identity. What is the significance of a body-swapping thought experiment in the context of personal identity over time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe body-swapping thought experiment is a famous example used to illustrate John Locke's memory theory of personal identity. It's meant to motivate Locke's idea that personal identity is tied to continuity of memory by asking what happens if the memories of one person are transferred into the body of another person. This thought experiment challenges our intuitive notions of what it means to be the same person over time. Do you have any other questions about this topic?\n\n**User:**\nFinally, can you tell me what John Locke's definition of a person is? \n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to John Locke, a person is a thinking, intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can consider itself as itself. This definition highlights the importance of rational thought and self-awareness in Locke's concept of personhood. I hope this conversation has been helpful in clarifying these philosophical ideas!"}
