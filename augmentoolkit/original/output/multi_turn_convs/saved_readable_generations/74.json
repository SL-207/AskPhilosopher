Wikforss.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the name of the philosopher who wrote the book \"Consciousness Revisited: Materialism without Phenomenal Concepts\" in 2009?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThe philosopher who wrote the book \"Consciousness Revisited: Materialism without Phenomenal Concepts\" in 2009 is Michael Tye.\n", "conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about philosophy lately, and I came across a concept called \"externalism.\" What's the central idea of externalism in philosophy?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExternalism is a fascinating topic in philosophy. According to externalism, our mental contents depend constitutively on our physical and social environment. For example, the chemical composition of our lakes and oceans is a crucial factor in determining what we perceive and think about them. This idea challenges the traditional notion of internalism, which holds that our thoughts and perceptions are solely determined by our internal states. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's a interesting idea. I'd like to dive deeper. I'm reading a book called \"Explaining Behavior: Reasons in a World of Causes\" by Fred Dretske. What's the title of this book?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can help clarify that for you. The title of the book is indeed \"Explaining Behavior: Reasons in a World of Causes\" by Fred Dretske.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also interested in learning more about social externalism. I came across a paper called \"Social Externalism and Conceptual Errors\" written by Asa M. Wikforss in 2001. Can you tell me who this philosopher is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAsa M. Wikforss is indeed the philosopher who wrote the paper \"Social Externalism and Conceptual Errors\" in 2001. I can tell you more about his work if you'd like.\n\n**User:**\nI'm also reading about materialism and phenomenal concepts. I came across a book called \"Consciousness Revisited: Materialism without Phenomenal Concepts\" by Michael Tye, published in 2009. Can you confirm the author of this book?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe philosopher who wrote the book \"Consciousness Revisited: Materialism without Phenomenal Concepts\" in 2009 is indeed Michael Tye. I can provide more information about his work if you're interested."}
