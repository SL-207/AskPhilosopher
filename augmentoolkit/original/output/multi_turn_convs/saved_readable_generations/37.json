Parallel reasoning has also been used to challenge representation- alism. On representationalism, phenomenal properties are identified with (or at least supervene on) representational properties—properties of representing the world (Harman 1990, Chalmers 2004).

For example, on this view, phenomenal redness is the property of representing redness. Also on this view, what it is to represent redness is fully determined by such things as the fact that certain sorts of visual experiences (described in objective, scientific terms) are typically caused by interacting with red objects. In other words, there is “causal co-variation” between phenomenally red experiences and interaction with red objects.

Can you explain representationalism to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help clarify representationalism. Representationalism is the view that phenomenal properties, such as color qualia, are identified with or supervene on representational properties, which are properties of representing the world. On this view, phenomenal properties are seen as being a result of how the world is represented. In simpler terms, representationalism suggests that how we experience the world is a result of how our senses represent that world to us. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's a fascinating perspective. In the context of the Inverted Spectrum thought experiment, can Invert and Non-vert have the same color qualia if they have the same representational properties?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, according to representationalism, if Invert and Non-vert have the same representational properties, including causal history, it is possible that they have the same color qualia. This is because representationalism suggests that color qualia are determined by how we represent the world, not by the properties of the world itself. So, if Invert and Non-vert have the same way of representing the world, they could potentially have the same subjective experience of color. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nI'm getting a better understanding of representationalism, but I still have some questions. What are some of the key factors that determine what it means to represent a particular property, such as redness?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to significant versions of representationalism, what it means to represent a particular property, such as redness, is determined by factors such as the causal history of the representation, including the fact that certain sorts of visual experiences are typically caused by interacting with red objects. In other words, how we represent redness is influenced by our experiences and understanding of the world. Does that help clarify things?"}
