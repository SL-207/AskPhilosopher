What is the key factor that distinguishes an entity with mental states with representational content from one without, according to Neander and others?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn philosophical discussions of mental states and representational content, Neander and others argue that the key factor is that mental states with representational content have a history of co-varying with certain environmental factors. For example, an entity like Swampman, which is created by a lightning strike and has a similar body to a human but lacks a history of co-varying with environmental factors, would not possess mental states with representational content according to this view. Do you have any further questions about this topic?\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to explore this idea further. Why might the existence of Swampman with representational mentality be compatible with teleological theories, according to some arguments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome philosophers argue that teleological theories concern only actual cases, and therefore, hypothetical cases like Swampman are irrelevant to these theories. This means that even if we imagine a scenario where Swampman possesses mental states with representational content, it would not necessarily challenge or impact teleological theories. Do you have any more questions about this topic?\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to imagine a scenario with Swampman. What do Neander and others think would happen if you asked Swampman about the meaning of his words?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNeander and others believe that if you asked Swampman about the meaning of his words, he would likely be surprised to discover that his words do not refer to anything. However, this would not change the fact that his words do not have any meaning. It's a thought experiment that highlights the limitations of Swampman's mental state, despite his similar appearance to a human. Do you have any more questions about this topic?\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to explore the reliability of intuitions about the Swampman case. What is the argument of Karen Neander (1991) regarding the reliability of intuitions about the Swampman case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nKaren Neander argues that the Swampman case is hypothetical and unrealistic, and therefore, our intuitions about it may not be reliable. This is a common concern in philosophy, where hypothetical scenarios can lead to misleading intuitions. Neander's argument is that we should be cautious when interpreting our intuitions about the Swampman case, as it may not reflect the complexities of real-world mental states. Do you have any more questions about this topic?\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to explore this idea further. What is an example used to illustrate that intuitions can be misleading?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne example used to illustrate that intuitions can be misleading is that water cannot exist without H2O. Although it might be possible to have a substance that is indistinguishable from water, it would still not be water. This example highlights how our intuitions can be misled by the presence of similar but distinct entities. Similarly, the Swampman case can lead to misleading intuitions about the nature of mental states and representational content. Do you have any more questions about this topic?"}
