I came across it in the context of Ned Block's work. Who is Ned Block, and what work is he associated with in the context of Inverted Qualia?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNed Block is a philosopher associated with the work \"Inverted Earth,\" a paper published in 1990 that explores the concept of Inverted Qualia. In that paper, Block discussed the idea that there could be a world, called Inverted Earth, where everything appears to be the same as it does in our world, but the qualitative experiences of the inhabitants of Inverted Earth are inverted from those of the inhabitants of our world. For example, what looks red to us would look green to the inhabitants of Inverted Earth, but they would experience the color they see as red. Block's work on Inverted Earth has been influential in the discussion of Inverted Qualia. Do you have any further questions about Inverted Qualia or related topics?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I was reading about Gilbert Harman's work on the subject as well. Who is Gilbert Harman, and what contributions has he made to the discussion of Inverted Qualia?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGilbert Harman is a philosopher who has written extensively on the topic of Inverted Qualia. His work \"The Intrinsic Quality of Experience\" (1990) explores the idea that experiences have an intrinsic quality or \"what-it-is-like\" that cannot be reduced to their functional or representational properties. In other words, Harman argues that the subjective, qualitative aspects of experience, such as what it's like to see a red apple, cannot be captured by purely functional or computational theories of the mind. His work has been influential in shaping the debate around Inverted Qualia and the nature of subjective experience. Do you have any thoughts or questions about the implications of their work?"}
