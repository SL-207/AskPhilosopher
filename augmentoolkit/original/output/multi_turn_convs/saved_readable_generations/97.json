Yes, someone who is ignorant of geometry might think that they are conceiving of a right triangle for which the Pythagorean theorem does not hold. However, the Pythagorean theorem holds for all right triangles, so the given scenario is not possible. This is an example of how conceivability does not necessarily entail possibility.\n\n**User:**\nI've also been reading about the approaches of philosophers like Descartes and Gertler. How does Gertler's approach to conceivability differ from Descartes'?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGertler suggests that conceiving of a scenario will entail that the scenario is possible only when the concepts involved are sufficiently comprehensive. However, Gertler does not give a precise answer to the question of what constitutes a comprehensive concept. Instead, she provides examples to help illustrate the notion. This is in contrast to Descartes, who stressed the importance of clear and distinct concepts for conceivability to entail possibility. Do you have any more questions about conceivability arguments?\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to see the point, but I'm still a bit confused. What is the main criticism of conceivability arguments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main criticism of conceivability arguments is that conceivability does not necessarily entail possibility. This is because someone who is ignorant of a particular subject matter may be able to conceive of a scenario that is impossible, simply because they do not understand the underlying principles. For instance, our earlier example of someone with limited knowledge of geometry might be able to conceive of a scenario that doesn't adhere to the Pythagorean theorem without realizing its impossibility. This criticism challenges the idea that conceivability can be used as a reliable method for determining possibility.\n\n**User:**\nI understand the criticism, but I'd like to know how Descartes tries to address it. Does he have a counterargument or a solution to this problem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDescartes attempts to address this criticism by insisting that only when a conception is clear and distinct will conceivability entail possibility. This means that for a concept to be clear and distinct, the person must have a deep understanding of the underlying principles. In other words, Descartes argues that conceivability can only be used as a reliable method for determining possibility when the concepts involved are thoroughly understood and clarified. Does that help clarify Descartes' approach to this criticism?"}
