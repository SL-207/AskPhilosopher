Those philosophers usually believe that a complete physics would be a fully general science, leaving nothing out. Nevertheless, many also believe that sciences with more limited domains—the so called “special sciences” like psychology and biology—are essential to getting a full picture of the world.

THE CASE Two popular beliefs seem to be in tension: (1) physics is complete in the sense that everything that happens is covered by physical law, and if you fix everything described by physics, you fix the nature of the world as a whole; and (2) sciences such as psychology and biology dis- cover important truths about the world that physics does not capture.

What's the general view on this among philosophers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn philosophy, many thinkers believe that the special sciences, such as psychology and biology, are essential to getting a full picture of the world. They think that these sciences discover things that physics does not and help us see the world's joints, even if they are not the fundamental ones. It's a complex relationship, but it's a topic of ongoing debate and discussion.\n\n**User:**\nI see. And what's the main goal of a physicalist, in terms of the philosophy of science?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMany philosophers who are physicalists believe that a complete physics would be a fully general science, leaving nothing out. This means that they aim to create a comprehensive physical theory that can explain all phenomena in the world.\n\n**User:**\nThose seem like two contradictory views. One says that the special sciences are essential, and the other says that a complete physical theory can explain everything. How can we reconcile these views?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne possible way to reconcile these views is to take a concessive approach. According to this view, the special sciences are just different ways of talking about the same events, perhaps at different levels of description or restricted to different contexts. In this view, physics ultimately doesn't leave anything out.\n\n**User:**\nI see what you mean. But it seems like there are two popular beliefs that seem to be in tension with each other. Can you walk me through those two beliefs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are two popular beliefs that seem to conflict with each other. Firstly, physics is complete in the sense that everything that happens is covered by physical law, and if you fix everything described by physics, you fix the nature of the world as a whole. Secondly, sciences such as psychology and biology discover important truths about the world that physics does not capture.\n\n**User:**\nYes, those do seem like two conflicting views. Do you think it's possible to reconcile these views, or are they fundamentally at odds with each other?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt's a challenging question, and philosophers continue to debate it. However, the concessive approach I mentioned earlier is one possible way to reconcile these views. By seeing the special sciences as different levels of description, rather than as separate entities, we may be able to find common ground between the two views. Do you have any further questions about this topic?"}
