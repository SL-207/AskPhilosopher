{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " THE CASE Consider a typical synesthete whom we’ll call Cyndi. Cyndi has chromesthesia. For her, making breakfast is a very colorful experience. When she puts the bacon into the pan and hears the sizzle, she has a sensation of red. When she cracks an egg, she has a sensation of blue. And when she pours orange juice into a glass, she has a sensation of green. How are we to characterize these color experiences? Are they per- ceptual in nature? If so, should we say that Cyndi is seeing green or hearing green? Neither of these options seems satisfactory. On the one hand, given that colors are typically discriminated vis- ually, it may seem tempting to say that Cyndi is seeing green as she’s pouring the orange juice. But there is nothing green in her visual field. Her eyes may even be closed while she is having the relevant experience. Moreover, given that her color experience is caused by Synesthesia 219 an auditory stimulus, it may seem odd to characterize her perceptual experience as something that’s visual in nature. One way that we dis- tinguish auditory experiences from visual experiences is in terms of the kinds of inputs that generate the relevant experience. In Cyndi’s case, there is not the kind of input typical of visual experiences. In this case, the input is auditory in nature. That suggests that we should say she is hearing the color. And in fact, this is how synesthesia is often described, as in neurologist Rich- ard Cytowic’s 1998 book titled, The Man Who Tasted Shapes (see also Brang and Ramachandran 2011).

Given the nature of colors, they are not the kinds of experiences that can be discrim- inated from one another by way of auditory perception.

I want to explore the nature of her experience with you. What is a potential challenge to classifying Cyndi's experience as a perceptual experience?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's an interesting thought experiment! One potential challenge is that colors are typically associated with visual perception, and it is not clear how to classify them as auditory experiences. This might raise some questions about the nature of perception and how our brains process different types of sensory information. Would you like to explore this idea further?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. If Cyndi is not seeing the color, should we say that she is hearing the color?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt seems that we should say that Cyndi is hearing the color, as the input that generates her experience is auditory in nature. However, it is not clear how to make sense of the claim that colors can be heard, as colors do not have auditory properties. This might force us to reconsider our assumptions about the relationship between sensory modalities and the way we experience the world. Do you have any thoughts on how to approach this?\n\n**User:**\nI think this is getting at the heart of the matter. What is the nature of Cyndi's experience when she hears the sizzle of the bacon and has a sensation of red?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCyndi's experience is a color experience that is caused by an auditory stimulus. The nature of this experience is unclear, as colors are typically discriminated visually, but there is no visual input in Cyndi's case. This raises questions about the potential for cross-modal perception and how our brains might be able to process and integrate different types of sensory information. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss about this thought experiment?"}
