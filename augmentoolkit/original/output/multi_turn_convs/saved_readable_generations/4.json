What does it mean to feel pain, according to this view?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to analytic functionalism, to feel pain is to have a state (any state) that plays pain's characteristic causal role. It's a functionalist view that focuses on the role or function a state plays rather than its intrinsic properties. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat does make sense, but I'm still curious about how this view explains the possibility of different types of pain, such as mad pain and Martian pain. Can you explain how analytic functionalism handles this issue?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGreat question! According to analytic functionalism, the key to explaining the possibility of different types of pain is species (or population) relativity. The states that play the relevant causal role can differ from one species (or population) to the next. So, for example, what plays the causal role of pain in humans might be different from what plays that role in a Martian or a mad person.\n\n**User:**\nI read that Lewis's solution to the problem of pain and its variations across species might seem implausible. Can you explain why this might be the case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLewis's solution might seem implausible because it suggests that whether an individual feels pain would be entirely a matter of what is happening in that individual, regardless of how they might relate to others. This might seem counterintuitive, as we tend to think that pain is a subjective experience that depends on an individual's internal state, but also that it can be understood and recognized by others.\n\n**User:**\nI also came across an example involving a person named Maddy. According to this example, Maddy has a neural state that typically plays the role of causing pain in humans, but in her, that state does not play that role. Despite this, she still feels pain. Can you explain why this is the case?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMaddy can still feel pain because she has the state that typically plays the relevant causal role in humans, even though in her that state does not play that role. It's a case of identifying the state with the functional role it typically plays, rather than with its internal properties. This highlights the functionalist aspect of analytic functionalism, which focuses on the role or function a state plays rather than its intrinsic properties."}
