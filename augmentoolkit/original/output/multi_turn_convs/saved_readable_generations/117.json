{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " Instead, this puzzle seems to depend on independently plausible and less contentious claims. One is a simple fact about translation: “London is pretty” is a translation of “Londres est jolie,” and so those sentences express the same propo- sition. The other is an unobjectionable view about belief ascription: when a subject assents to a sentence “S” and understands what “S” Puzzling Pierre 175 means—namely S—then the subject believes S. It seems we often use these principles implicitly. Suppose John, an English-speaker, sincerely assents to the sentence “London is pretty.” It looks like we should say John believes London is pretty. Suppose Jacques, a French-speaker, sincerely asserts to the sentence “Londres est jolie.” It seems we should say Jacques also believes London is pretty. Following the same sorts of principles in the Pierre case leads to the puzzling fact that Pierre be- lieves both that London is pretty and that London is not pretty. There are at least two lessons we can take from Kripke’s example. First, it’s a puzzle: what exactly does Pierre believe? Something seems to have gone wrong here; but what? Second, since it seems puzzles of this sort can be generated without the Millian principle; we might think again about our inclination to reject that principle because of Hespe- rus/Phosphorus cases: they appear to be very similar to the Londres/ London cases, after all, which don’t depend on the Millian principle. If the puzzle raises a general problem for belief ascription, it’s not clear the Millian principle is to blame in Hesperus/Phosphorus cases after all.

What is puzzling about the case of Pierre?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can help you understand the case of Pierre. What's puzzling is that, following the same principles, we seem to ascribe contradictory beliefs to Pierre: he believes that London is pretty, and he believes that London is not pretty. This seems to be a contradiction, but it's also an interesting example of how language and meaning can be complex.\n\n**User:**\nI see what you mean. The example mentions John and Jacques, and how we ascribe beliefs to them. What is the basis for ascribing beliefs to John and Jacques in this example?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe basis for ascribing beliefs to John and Jacques is that they sincerely assent to sentences that express the same proposition. For John, the sentence is \"London is pretty\", and for Jacques, the sentence is \"Londres est jolie\". Therefore, they both seem to believe that London is pretty. This is because they understand the meaning of the sentences and sincerely agree with them.\n\n**User:**\nI'm reading more about the example, and I think I see a connection to the Hesperus/Phosphorus cases. What is a possible lesson from Kripke's example for the Hesperus/Phosphorus cases?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe lesson is that, since puzzles of this sort can be generated without the Millian principle, we might think again about our inclination to reject that principle because of Hesperus/Phosphorus cases. In other words, the example of Pierre and the Hesperus/Phosphorus cases may have more in common than we initially thought.\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the principle used in the example of Pierre. What is a principle about translation that is used in the example of Pierre?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe principle states that when a subject assents to a sentence \"S\" and understands what \"S\" means, then the subject believes S. This principle is used to ascribe beliefs to Pierre and other subjects in the example.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I'm interested in the relationship between the sentences \"London is pretty\" and \"Londres est jolie\". What is the relationship between these two sentences?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe sentences \"London is pretty\" and \"Londres est jolie\" are translations of each other, and therefore they express the same proposition. This means that they convey the same meaning and can be used to describe the same situation."}
