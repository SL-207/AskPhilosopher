{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " For the transparency thesis to support representationalism, it must be interpreted in terms of strong transparency. Because Kind thinks that the strong transparency thesis is false—that experience is only weakly transparent—she concludes that the transparency-based case for representationalism fails. Worries have also been raised about whether the transparency ­thesis is meant to be a negative thesis, a positive thesis, or both (see, e.g., Stol- jar 2004). Understood as a negative thesis, the claim that ­experience is transparent would be a claim about what we can’t directly attend to. Un- derstood as a positive claim, it would be making a claim about what we PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 114 can directly attend to. It looks like the negative claim is required for the representationalist case to go through. Simply claiming that we directly attend to what’s represented does not establish that there is nothing else to attend to. Arguably, the more plausible interpretation of transparency is the positive one. It seems clear that we can directly attend to the tree when attending to our experience of the tree. But if that’s all that transparency amounts to, then it would not provide the support for rep- resentationalism that it is often thought to provide (see Molyneux 2009).

What's the problem with interpreting the transparency thesis as only a positive claim?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe issue with interpreting the transparency thesis as only a positive claim is that it doesn't provide sufficient support for representationalism. The positive claim alone doesn't establish that there's nothing else to attend to. This means that we can't be sure that experience is transparent in the way that representationalism requires. Would you like me to elaborate on this?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that would be helpful. What must the transparency thesis be, in order for it to support representationalism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFor the transparency thesis to support representationalism, it must be understood as a strong transparency thesis. This means that it not only claims that we can directly attend to what's represented, but also that there's nothing else to attend to. This additional claim is necessary to establish that experience is transparent in a way that supports representationalism. Do you have any further questions about the transparency thesis?\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to see the distinction. What's the issue with relying solely on the negative claim that experience is transparent, i.e., understood as a claim about what we can't directly attend to?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRelying solely on the negative claim doesn't provide enough support for representationalism. This is because it still doesn't establish that there's nothing else to attend to. Even if we can't directly attend to certain things, it's still possible that there are other things that we can attend to, but that don't fit with the representationalist view. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I think so. And finally, what's the more plausible interpretation of transparency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe more plausible interpretation of transparency is arguably the positive one, which claims that we can directly attend to the object of experience. However, this interpretation doesn't provide the support for representationalism that we often think it does. If transparency is just about being able to attend to the object of experience, then it's not enough to establish that experience is transparent in a way that supports representationalism. Does that clarify things?"}
