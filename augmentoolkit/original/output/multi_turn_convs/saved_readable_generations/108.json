One can believe that grass is green, hope that grass is green, desire that grass is green, etc. The relevant propositions are sometimes described as mental contents, which in turn are often described as containing concepts or notions, such as the concept of being green.

What is the concept of mental contents, and what is often described as being contained within them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMental contents are the propositions that are the objects of propositional attitudes. They are often described as containing concepts or notions, such as the concept of being green. Think of it as the information that we have stored in our minds that we can use to form thoughts and make decisions. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat does. But what are propositional attitudes, and what are some examples of them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPropositional attitudes are mental states that involve attitudes towards propositions. Examples of propositional attitudes include believing, hoping, and desiring that a particular proposition is true. These attitudes are like lenses that we use to view and interpret the information contained in our mental contents. Think of them as our emotional and cognitive stances towards the world around us.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to consider a scenario. Suppose that Alfred believes an apple to be wholesome at noon, but it is replaced with a rotten apple at 12:01. Does Alfred's internal state remain constant in relevant respects?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Alfred's internal state remains constant in relevant respects, even though the apple he believes in changes from wholesome to rotten. His mental contents still contain the concept of being wholesome, and his propositional attitude remains the same, even if the object of his belief has changed.\n\n**User:**\nI disagree with internalism, and I argue for externalism (also known as anti-individualism). According to this view, the contents of propositional attitudes do depend on one's external environment. Is that right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou disagree with internalism, and you argue for externalism (also known as anti-individualism). According to this view, the contents of propositional attitudes do depend on one's external environment. You're arguing that our mental contents and propositional attitudes are shaped by our interactions with the world around us. That's a common view in the philosophy of mind.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the basic claim of internalism, and what does it imply?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe basic claim of internalism is that the contents of propositional attitudes do not depend on one's external environment. This implies that one might have exactly the same mental states even if one's external environment were radically different. In other words, internalism suggests that our mental contents and propositional attitudes are isolated from the world and are determined solely by our internal states.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the central question being addressed in the discussion of internalism and externalism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe central question being addressed is whether the contents that figure into one's propositional attitudes depend constitutively on one's environment. It's a question about the relationship between our internal mental states and the external world that surrounds us.\n\n**User:**\nHow do features of one's environment typically influence which propositions one believes, desires, etc.?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFeatures of one's environment often causally influence which propositions one believes, desires, etc. For example, seeing grass typically causes one to form beliefs about it. Our environment shapes our mental contents and propositional attitudes in subtle but important ways. Does that answer your question?"}
