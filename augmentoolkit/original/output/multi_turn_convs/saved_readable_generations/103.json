After the swap, viewers find it natural to identify the person in the teenage body as the mother and the person in the older body as the daughter. Despite the intuitive appeal of the memory theory, it has often come in for criticism. One influential criticism, offered in the 18th century by Thomas Reid (1785), proceeds by way of a thought experiment involv- ing a brave army officer. While fighting in an important campaign, this officer saves his entire unit and is awarded a prestigious medal. Though the officer is now highly respected, he was something of a miscreant as a young boy. In particular, he remembers an incident in which he stole some apples from his neighbor’s tree. As the officer ages, he becomes a general, and then retires. In retirement, he gradually becomes more and more senile, and, at a certain point, the retired general can remember winning the medal but can no longer remember stealing the apples or The Prince and the Cobbler 243 anything else from that time of his life. As Reid notes, Locke’s theory now gives us a paradoxical result. To simplify, let’s refer to the retired general as RG, the army officer as AO, and the young boy as YB. Since RG can remember experiences of AO, RG is identical to AO. Since AO can remember experiences of YB, AO is identical to YB. According to the transitivity of identity, if A is identical to B and B is identical to C, then A is identical to C. Putting this together with the two prior claims, we get the result that RG is identical to YB. But, since RG has no memories of the experiences of YB, and since Locke’s memory theory requires such memory connections for personal identity, we also get the result that RG is not identical to YB. Thus, Locke’s memory theory seems to result in a contradiction.

What is the transitivity of identity, and how is it related to the paradoxical result?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe transitivity of identity is the principle that if A is identical to B and B is identical to C, then A is identical to C. This principle is used to derive the paradoxical result in certain thought experiments. Do you have a specific thought experiment in mind that you'd like to discuss?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I'm fascinated by the paradoxical result that arises when applying Locke's memory theory to a particular thought experiment. Can you tell me more about that? What is the argument against Locke's memory theory, and what conclusion does it lead to?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe argument against Locke's memory theory is that it leads to a paradoxical result when applied to the thought experiment. The conclusion is that Locke's memory theory is flawed and cannot account for certain situations, such as the one involving the brave army officer. This thought experiment is often used to challenge Locke's theory of personal identity.\n\n**User:**\nWho is the brave army officer in the thought experiment, and what does he do during his career?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe brave army officer is the person who saves his entire unit and is awarded a prestigious medal during a campaign. He later becomes a general and then retires, eventually becoming senile.\n\n**User:**\nI see. Now, I'd like to understand the paradoxical result that arises when applying Locke's memory theory to this thought experiment. What is it, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe paradoxical result is that the retired general (RG) is both identical to and not identical to the young boy (YB). This is because RG can remember experiences of the army officer (AO), who in turn can remember experiences of YB, making RG identical to YB. However, since RG has no memories of the experiences of YB, Locke's memory theory requires that RG not be identical to YB. Does that clarify the paradox?"}
