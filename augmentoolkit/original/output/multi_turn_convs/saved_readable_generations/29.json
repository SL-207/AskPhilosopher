I was wondering what Russellian monism is, and how it addresses the Exclusion Problem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRussellian monism is a view that sees the world as having a mental or proto-mental base that ultimately explains the physical phenomena. On this view, mental properties are not just emergent at the level of brains, but actually ground all of the physical properties in the world. This approach can be seen as a way to avoid the Exclusion Problem by positing that mental properties are fundamental to the world. Does that make sense? It's a bit complex, but I'm here to explain it further if you need me to.\n\n**User:**\nThat does make sense. I'm trying to understand the relationship between Russellian monism and the idea of completeness. How do they relate?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Russellian monist view requires the denial of completeness, meaning that the world is not fully explained by physical properties. However, the Russellian monist will argue that this denial is empirically unobjectionable, and can be supported by empirical evidence. In other words, the Russellian monist is saying that the world is not just a physical place, but there's something more to it, and that's where mental properties come in. Does that clarify the relationship for you?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the Exclusion Problem. What is it, and why is it significant in the context of dualism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Exclusion Problem is significant because it challenges the idea that mental properties can have a causal role in the world. If mental properties cannot cause physical effects without being excluded by the physical cause, then it appears that they play no causal role at all. This is a problem for dualism, which posits that mental properties are real and have a causal role. It's a bit of a paradox, and it's a challenge that philosophers have been trying to address for a while.\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to see the problem. What is the Exclusion Problem in the context of dualism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Exclusion Problem is the challenge of explaining how mental properties can cause physical effects without being excluded by the physical cause. In other words, it is the problem of how to reconcile the idea that mental properties have a causal role with the fact that physical properties are thought to be the only causes of physical effects. Does that clarify the problem?\n\n**User:**\nI think so. I see that it's a challenge for dualism. What is the argument that some philosophers have made in response to the Exclusion Problem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome philosophers have argued that mental properties can over-determine their effects, meaning that both the physical cause and the mental cause are present and contribute to the effect. This would be a curious state of affairs, but it could potentially provide a way to save our intuitions about mental causation. It's a creative solution, but it's not without its challenges and implications. Does that help clarify the response to the Exclusion Problem?"}
