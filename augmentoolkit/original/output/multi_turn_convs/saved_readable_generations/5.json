{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " Sally could desire that her mother send money. What makes one state a belief and the other a desire? Can anything general be said about the difference, beyond simply repeat- ing that one is a belief and the other is a desire? Elizabeth Anscombe (1957) suggests (or at least has been taken to suggest) that a key dif- ference is what she calls “direction of fit.” Her famous case of the shopping list illustrates this concept. THE CASE Imagine a man walking through a grocery store with a shopping list. The list says: cheese, bread, chocolate, grapes …. Following him is a detective who writes her own list, based on what the man bought. Her list says: cheese, bread, chocolate, grapes …. These lists are in some sense exactly the same—they name the same items. But they also 29 The Shopping List 179 differ. The shopper’s list guides the shopper’s actions—to make the list accurate, he must fill his cart with the listed items. The items should match the list. The detective’s list, on the other hand, is meant to re- flect what the shopper bought. The list should match the items. So, suppose that the man gets home and finds that instead of grapes he bought grappa. The shopper can’t fix his mistake by crossing “grapes” off the list and replacing it with “grappa.” This would miss the point of the list—to fix the mistake he needs to go back and trade the grappa for the grapes. If the detective, on the other hand, has “grapes” on her list when the man bought grappa, she can fix the mistake by correcting her list. The point can be glossed by the idea that the lists have different directions of fit. The detective’s list has to fit the way the world turns out to be. The shopper has to make the world fit the list. ­Anscombe’s suggestion, then, is that mental states differ in the same way as the lists.

In the example of the shopping list, if the shopper tried to correct their desire by crossing \"grapes\" off the list and replacing it with \"grappa\", they would be missing the point of the list, which is to make the world match the list. Instead, they should go back and trade the grappa for the grapes to make the world match the list.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the main difference between a belief and a desire?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThe main difference between a belief and a desire, according to Anscombe's suggestion, is the direction of fit. Beliefs aim to match the way the world is, while desires aim to make the world match the agent's representation of it.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nCan you give an example of how this difference manifests in a real-life situation?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nConsider a shopping list. When you make a shopping list, you are trying to make the world (i.e., your purchases) match the list. If you realize you didn't buy something you wanted, you can go back and buy it to make the list accurate. However, when someone else creates a list to record your purchases, they are trying to match the list to the way the world is (i.e., what you actually bought). If they notice a mistake, they can correct it by changing the list.\n", "conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about mental states and came across the concept of a \"direction of fit\". Can you explain what that means?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe phrase \"direction of fit\" is used to describe the way a mental state relates to the world. A mental state with a direction of fit aims to match the way the world is (if you're having a belief) or makes the world match the agent's representation of it (if you're having a desire). Think of it like a target: a belief is like a target that matches the way the world is, while a desire is like a target that changes the world to match it. I'd be happy to help you understand it better. Do you have any further questions or would you like me to clarify any part of this?\n\n**User:**\nI think I understand the concept better now. I came across a quote by Anscombe that says something about correcting desires by changing the world to match the list. Can you tell me more about what she meant by that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAnscombe's idea is that when you try to correct a desire by changing the world to match the list, rather than changing the list to match the world, you're acting in a way that's not consistent with the nature of desires. Using the shopping list example, if the shopper tries to correct their desire by crossing \"grapes\" off the list and replacing it with \"grappa\", they're missing the point of the list, which is to make the world match the list. Instead, they should go back and trade the grappa for the grapes to make the world match the list. I hope that makes it clearer. Do you have any other questions about Anscombe's idea?\n\n**User:**\nI'm starting to see the difference between a belief and a desire. But what is the main difference between the two, according to Anscombe's suggestion?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Anscombe's suggestion, the main difference between a belief and a desire is the direction of fit. Beliefs aim to match the way the world is, while desires aim to make the world match the agent's representation of it. Beliefs are like targets that match the world, whereas desires are like targets that change the world to match them. Is that a bit clearer now?\n\n**User:**\nI think so. But I'd love to see an example to drive the point home. Can you give me a real-life situation that illustrates the difference between a belief and a desire?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI can certainly try. Consider a shopping list. When you make a shopping list, you're trying to make the world (i.e., your purchases) match the list. If you realize you didn't buy something you wanted, you can go back and buy it to make the list accurate. However, when someone else creates a list to record your purchases, they're trying to match the list to the way the world is (i.e., what you actually bought). If they notice a mistake, they can correct it by changing the list. I hope that example helps to illustrate the difference between a belief and a desire in a real-life situation!"}
