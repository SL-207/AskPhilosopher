Contemporary philosophers often character- ize the physical by deferring to physics: physical phenomena are the entities described by fundamental physics, or those plus entities that are constructed from them (Loewer 2001; see Chapter 21). In other words, to be physical is to be, or to be made of, entities that exist at the fundamental level of physical reality. For example, if quarks and lep- tons are posited by fundamental physics, then they and the things they compose are physical. But what if there is no fundamental level? For example, what if quarks and leptons are composed of more basic enti- ties? And what if those more basic entities are composed of still more basic entities, and so on forever (ad infinitum)?

What's the problem that arises if we assume that there is no fundamental level of physical reality, and that objects are composed of more basic entities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's an interesting thought experiment. The problem is that physicalism, which claims that everything is physical, seems to rule out the possibility of objects being composed of more basic entities. This creates a paradox, as physicalism should be able to accommodate the possibility of objects being composed of more fundamental entities. This is a classic problem in the philosophy of physicalism, and it's still an active area of debate among philosophers.\n\n**User:**\nI'm not familiar with this concept of physicalism. Can you explain what it is and what it claims about the nature of reality?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPhysicalism is the idea that everything in the world is physical. This means that all objects, properties, and phenomena in the universe can be explained and described in terms of fundamental physical reality. In other words, physicalism claims that everything can be reduced to physical properties and laws, without the need for any non-physical entities or explanations.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But how do contemporary philosophers define what it means to be physical? Is it just a matter of being composed of physical matter, or is there more to it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nContemporary philosophers often define the physical by deferring to physics, meaning that physical phenomena are the entities described by fundamental physics, or those entities that are constructed from them. In other words, being physical means being subject to the laws and principles of physics, and being composed of entities that are themselves physical. Does that clarify things?"}
