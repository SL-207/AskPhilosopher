What is the key difference between material operations and conscious experiences, according to Leibniz's argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLeibniz's argument suggests that material operations concern how things operate in space and time, whereas conscious experiences are about how things feel, or what it's like for the being that has conscious experiences. In other words, material operations are about the external world, whereas conscious experiences are about subjective experience.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But I'm not sure I follow the critique of the idea that material movements can be connected to thoughts and perceptions through laws. Can you explain the issue with that idea?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Leibniz's argument, the issue is that if material movements can be connected to thoughts and perceptions through laws, it would imply that the machine or system is not all there is. This would suggest that something external or additional is needed to account for conscious thoughts and perceptions. This is problematic because it would undermine the idea that material movements alone are sufficient to explain conscious experience.\n\n**User:**\nI see what you mean. So, what is the key point that defenders of Leibniz's argument will insist on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDefenders of Leibniz's argument will insist that there is a difference in kind between material movements and conscious thoughts and perceptions. They will argue that material movements can give rise to thoughts and perceptions, but that this would involve adding something to the machine, and if something must be added, then the machine is not all there is.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a strong argument. But isn't it possible that material movements could give rise to conscious thoughts and perceptions in some way? What is the main objection to this idea?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main objection is that even if material movements could generate thoughts and perceptions, it's unclear why these thoughts and perceptions should be conscious. Material operations concern how things operate in space and time, and it's not clear why these operations should feel like anything. In other words, it's not clear why material movements should give rise to subjective experience.\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to understand Leibniz's argument. So, what is the argument that he is making, and does it suggest that material minds are possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLeibniz's argument suggests that material minds are not possible, because material movements and thoughts/perceptions are fundamentally different in kind. Material movements concern how things operate in space and time, whereas consciousness is about how things feel, and it's unclear why material operations should feel like anything. Therefore, Leibniz's argument implies that consciousness cannot be reduced to material movements and operations."}
