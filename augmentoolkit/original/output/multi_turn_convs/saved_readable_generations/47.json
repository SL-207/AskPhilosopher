Perceptions aim to fit the world, but intentions aim to make the world fit them. DISCUSSION Though there is clearly something suggestive about Anscombe’s ex- ample and the resulting notion of directions of fit, it has proved to be a little difficult to spell out. One famous interpretation and applica- tion of direction of fit comes from Michael Smith (1994), who uses it to provide a functionalist account of beliefs and desires. On Smith’s model, somewhat roughly: a belief is that p is a state that tends to go out of existence when there is a perception that not-p, while a desire is that p is a state that endures despite that perception, and leads the subject to try to bring it about that p (see also Velleman 2000, p. 115.). This is a descriptive account of what makes beliefs and desires the states that they are. But there are a number of worries about this ac- count, not least that beliefs don’t always go out of existence in the face of disagreeing perceptions. Some beliefs are stubborn.

I'd love to learn more about how perceptions differ from intentions in terms of direction of fit.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to explain that concept. Perceptions aim to fit the world, whereas intentions aim to make the world fit them. This means that perceptions seek to match reality, whereas intentions seek to change or mould reality to match their own characteristics. In other words, perceptions are about understanding the world as it is, while intentions are about shaping the world to meet our goals or desires.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also come across the concept of the direction of fit contrast between beliefs and desires. What's a possible interpretation of this contrast?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to this interpretation, a belief is a state that tends to go out of existence when there is a perception that it is not true, while a desire is a state that endures despite a perception that it is not true, and leads the subject to try to bring it about that the desire is fulfilled. This highlights the difference between how beliefs are meant to align with reality and how desires motivate us to change reality to match our goals.\n\n**User:**\nThat's an interesting interpretation. However, I'm not sure if it accurately captures how beliefs and desires actually behave. Is it possible that the direction of fit contrast is meant to capture a normative aspect, rather than a descriptive one?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a valid point. The direction of fit contrast might indeed be normative, rather than descriptive, in nature. This means that it is outlining how beliefs and desires should behave, rather than how they actually do behave. For example, a subject's beliefs should represent the world, and a subject's desires make normative demands on how the subject should interact with the world.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I think I understand that nuance. Can you explain further what the normative demand is that a desire places on the subject's behavior?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf S desires that p, then S should try to bring it about that p. This means that a desire is a state that motivates the subject to take action to achieve its goal. In other words, a desire is not just a state of mind, but a call to action that guides the subject's behavior. Does that clarify the normative aspect of desires?"}
