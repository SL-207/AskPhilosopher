DISCUSSION If linguistic meaning is indeterminate, then we ought to reject many propositions that we ordinarily take for granted. For example, ordi- narily we do not think that what we refer to with our words is always indeterminate—as in the example noted above, where I seem to refer determinately to my friend Smith and the property of being tall with the words “Smith” and “is tall.” But appearances can be deceiving, and in this case, according to Quine, they are. Quine’s indeterminacy doctrine has been highly influential. There has also been considerable push-back. Some criticize his argument. One well-known criticism is due to Noam Chomsky (1968). Quine’s CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 142 reasoning begins with a premise about underdetermination: the evi- dence you gather when you observe the tribe member’s reaction to the rabbit doesn’t determine which of your empirical hypotheses about the meaning of “Gavagai!” is correct. But, as Chomsky argues, from that premise, Quine’s indeterminacy doctrine simply does not follow. Empirical hypotheses always go beyond the evidence. There are always multiple, inconsistent empirical hypotheses that are consistent with any set of observations. For example, there is an underdetermination by the evidence that physicists consider when they formulate empirical hy- potheses. It does not follow that there is no fact of the matter regarding which hypothesis is correct. Likewise, according to Chomsky, in the case of linguistic meaning, Quine’s premise—that the observable, em- pirical facts are consistent with multiple hypotheses about meaning— does not entail his indeterminacy of meaning doctrine. In response, Quine could argue that Chomsky’s objection assumes something that Quine rejects from the start: that there is something to the meaning of “Gavagai!", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "If linguistic meaning is indeterminate, what would be the implication for our ordinary understanding of language?", "answer": "If linguistic meaning is indeterminate, we would need to reject many propositions that we ordinarily take for granted.

If linguistic meaning is indeterminate, what would be the implication for our ordinary understanding of language?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help clarify things for you. That's a fascinating and complex topic in linguistics. If linguistic meaning is indeterminate, it means that the meaning of words and phrases is not fixed or determinate, but rather is influenced by a wide range of factors, including context, speaker intention, and listener interpretation.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds very abstract. Can you explain it in more concrete terms? What would be the implication for our ordinary understanding of language?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf linguistic meaning is indeterminate, it would mean that many of the things we think we know about language are actually not as clear-cut as we thought. For example, consider a situation where a speaker says \"John is tall.\" We might assume that the speaker is determinately referring to a person named John and the property of being tall. However, according to the doctrine of indeterminacy, this is not necessarily the case. In fact, the speaker might be using the word \"John\" to refer to someone else, or the word \"tall\" to refer to a different property.\n\n**User:**\nI see what you mean. That would mean that we can't take language at face value, and that we have to consider multiple possibilities when interpreting a sentence. Is that right?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good way to put it. If linguistic meaning is indeterminate, we would need to be more nuanced in our understanding of language, and we would need to consider the possibility that language is often ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations. This would require a more flexible and adaptive approach to communication, where we take into account the context and the potential for ambiguity in language.\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to get a better understanding of this concept. It's a bit unsettling to think that language is not as straightforward as we thought, but I suppose it's also kind of liberating to realize that language is more flexible and nuanced than we might have assumed.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a good way to look at it. The concept of indeterminacy in language can be a bit unsettling at first, but it can also lead to a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of language and communication."}
