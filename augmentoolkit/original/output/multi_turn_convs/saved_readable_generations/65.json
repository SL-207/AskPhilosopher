{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " To support that conclusion, David Chalmers considers some ­theories of consciousness that scientists have developed. One is ­Bernard Baars’ (1988) global workspace theory of consciousness. In this theory, the cognitive system that our brains realize includes a sort of central ­processor—a global workspace that mediates commu- nication between more specialized processors. Baars uses the model to explain contrasts between conscious and unconscious cognitive functions: information in the global workspace is conscious, while other information is not. Baars’ theory is controversial. But, even if his theory is true, the hard problem isn’t solved. The hard prob- lem isn’t about explaining cognitive functions. One might suppose that all and only conscious experiences (in the relevant what-it’s- like sense) are contents of the global workspace. But the question remains: why are those contents experienced at all?

What is the challenge to physicalism that arises from the explanatory gap?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe explanatory gap presents a challenge to physicalism because it suggests that consciousness is independent of physical phenomena. This means that the existence of consciousness cannot be fully explained by physical laws and processes, and therefore, consciousness cannot be reduced to PURELY PHYSICAL PHENOMENA. This idea raises questions about the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical world.\n\n**User:**\nThat helps clarify things. But I'm still not sure I understand the implications. What question remains unanswered even if one supposes that all and only conscious experiences (in the relevant what-it's-like sense) are contents of the global workspace?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEven if we assume that all conscious experiences are contents of the global workspace, the question remains: why are those contents experienced at all? This gets at the HARD PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS, which is to explain why we have subjective experiences at all. In other words, just because we can identify the neural processes that accompany conscious experiences, it doesn't explain why those experiences are subjective and qualitative.\n\n**User:**\nI see. That makes sense. I've also been reading about the global workspace theory of consciousness. What is the main difference between the global workspace theory and unconscious cognitive functions, according to Bernard Baars' theory?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Bernard Baars' theory, the main difference between the global workspace theory of consciousness and unconscious cognitive functions is that information in the global workspace is conscious, while other information is not. In other words, the global workspace is responsible for integrating information from various parts of the brain and making it conscious.\n\n**User:**\nThat's clear. But I'm still not sure I understand the implications of the global workspace theory. Why is the correlation between neural processes and conscious experiences not considered an explanation of consciousness?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe correlation between neural processes and conscious experiences is not considered an explanation of consciousness because correlation is not explanation. This means that even if scientists can identify neural processes that accompany all and only conscious experiences, they have not answered the question of why those contents are experienced at all. In other words, correlation does not imply causation, and identifying the neural processes that accompany conscious experiences does not explain why those experiences are subjective and qualitative."}
