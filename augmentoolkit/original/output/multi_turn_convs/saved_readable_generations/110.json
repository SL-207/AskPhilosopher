According to non-reductive physicalism, what role do brain states play in beliefs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNon-reductive physicalism suggests that brain states play the role of beliefs, but they are not the same as beliefs. Instead, they are the physical \"realizers\" or \"constituents\" of beliefs. This means that brain states are ultimately responsible for our mental experiences, but they are not identical with those experiences. Do you have any further questions about non-reductive physicalism?\n\n**User:**\nYes, actually. Can non-reductive physicalism and dualism both be subject to the exclusion problem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBoth non-reductive physicalism and dualism can be subject to the exclusion problem. The exclusion problem arises when mental properties seem to be epiphenomenal with respect to the physical world, lacking physical efficacy of their own, unless they are identical with physical properties. This is a challenge for both views, but in different ways.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can a non-reductive physicalist say that mental properties exist independently of the physical?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a non-reductive physicalist cannot say that mental properties exist independently of the physical. According to this view, mental properties are realized or constituted by physical properties, and they do not exist in isolation from the physical. So, mental properties are dependent on physical properties, but they are not identical with them.\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to understand. What's the main difference in how non-reductive physicalism and dualism respond to the exclusion problem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main difference is that non-reductive physicalism can take advantage of the fact that mental properties bear close relations to physical properties, whereas dualism does not. This is because mental properties in non-reductive physicalism are realized or constituted by physical properties, which allows for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between mind and body.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. Is there a good analogy for how mental properties are related to physical properties in non-reductive physicalism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there is an analogy often used in this context. It's the analogy of a queen in chess. Just as being a queen in chess is not identical with a particular physical type (e.g., a plastic or marble queen), being a mental property is not identical with a particular physical property. However, the movement of the queen is not independent of the physical movement of the plastic or marble queen. Similarly, mental properties are dependent on physical properties, but they are not identical with them. Does that make sense?"}
