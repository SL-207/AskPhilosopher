DISCUSSION Does change blindness (or inattentional blindness) really show that perceptual experience is sparse? Some think so (Blackmore et al. 1995, Rensink et al. 1997, Simons 1997, O’Regan and Noë 2001, Tye 2009). But others do not (Dretske 2007, Block 2007, 2012). How can we decide? Some issues can be resolved empirically. For example, consider experimental results such as the following (Fernandez-Duque and Thornton 2000). Subjects are first shown pairs of pictures that look identical to them (in the way drawings A and B look to you at first). Then they do a forced-choice task of selecting those pairs where there is a change. In other words, they are told to choose which pairs aren’t identical, even though they say all pairs look identical. They success- fully identify the non-identical pairs at above-chance levels.

But that doesn’t settle the issue of whether Sarah consciously perceives Sam. It’s consistent with the results of the forced-choice experiments that Sarah perceives Sam unconsciously, and that to see him consciously would require her focusing attention on him—at least enough for her to ask “Who (or what) is that?” Michael Tye defends that position.

Does the phenomenon of change blindness (inattentional blindness) show that perceptual experience is sparse?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question, but the answer is not a simple yes or no. Some people think that change blindness indicates that perceptual experience is sparse, but others do not. This is a matter of debate among researchers and philosophers. Do you have any other questions about change blindness or perceptual experience?\n\n**User:**\nI was wondering, under what conditions do we see things in our visual field?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWe see things in our visual field only when we attend to them. If we don't attend to them, they are only potentially seen. This has implications for how we understand the relationship between attention and perception. Would you like to know more about the relationship between attention and perception?\n\n**User:**\nI see what you're getting at. What is the difference between visually perceiving something and consciously perceiving it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVisually perceiving something may not necessarily mean that you consciously perceive it. You may be perceiving it unconsciously, and focusing attention on it would be required to consciously see it. This highlights the distinction between the two processes. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this topic?\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to get a better understanding. Can some issues related to change blindness be resolved empirically?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, some issues can be resolved empirically through experimental results. For example, studies have shown that people can successfully identify non-identical pairs of pictures even if they initially appear identical, indicating that their visual system may be registering or representing the things in the visual field that they don't notice. This kind of evidence can help us better understand the mechanisms underlying change blindness. Do you have any other questions about empirical research on this topic?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. According to Michael Tye, how is consciously seeing similar to a process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nConscious seeing is similar to a constructive process, such as drawing a picture. It's not like taking a clear, color photograph, but rather a process that leaves things out. This is a way of thinking about conscious seeing as a dynamic and interpretive process, rather than simply a passive reception of sensory information. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss about conscious seeing or perception?"}
