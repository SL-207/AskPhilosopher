What unites such diverse states is that there is something it’s like to have them (Nagel 1974; see Chapter 5).

Why is it puzzling that brain processes are accompanied by experiences, rather than simply going on in the dark?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question. It is puzzling because our brains are continuously processing information from our senses, but there is no obvious reason why this processing should be accompanied by subjective experiences. We can see this puzzle in the way our brains process information from our senses, but the experience itself is not directly observable. This has led many to ask, \"Why do we experience the world in the way that we do?\"\n\n**User:**\nI'm glad I asked. When I read about subjective experience in the context of consciousness, I wasn't entirely sure what it meant. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSubjective experience, or \"what-it's-like\" consciousness, refers to the quality of experience that is unique to an individual. This can include things like the pain of arthritis, the visual experience of seeing a red rose, or the existential angst one might feel while contemplating Sartre's reflections on death. It's the personal, individual aspect of our experiences that makes them feel real to us.\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to get it. But what's the difference between being awake and being asleep, and how might the term \"consciousness\" be used to mark that distinction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen used in this way, \"consciousness\" might refer to the state of being awake. For example, one might say \"I lost consciousness the minute my head hit the pillow\" to indicate that they fell asleep. In this sense, consciousness is the opposite of unconsciousness, and it refers to the state of being aware and alert.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But there's still something puzzling to me. What is the hard problem of consciousness, and who is credited with first describing it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe hard problem of consciousness is a particularly difficult puzzle that some argue is unique to consciousness. It was first described by David J. Chalmers in 1995. The hard problem is essentially the question of why we have subjective experiences at all. Why do we experience the world in the way that we do, rather than simply processing information in a more mechanical or computational way?\n\n**User:**\nI think I'm starting to see why this is such a difficult problem to solve. But why might the scientific explanation of consciousness seem inevitable, given the progress made in cognitive science and neuroscience?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is a strong reason to believe that a scientific explanation of consciousness is forthcoming, because the field is advancing rapidly and many mysteries, including those about life, have been solved in the past. Scientists are confident that they can continue to make progress in understanding the neural basis of consciousness and that, eventually, they will be able to explain why we have subjective experiences."}
