I came across the term \"neobehaviorism\" and wanted to understand it better. According to Galen Strawson, what is a possibility that refutes neobehaviorism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGalen Strawson has argued that a possibility that refutes neobehaviorism is the idea of sentient, intelligent creatures like the weather watchers, which have sensations, emotions, thoughts, etc., but are unable to behave. This possibility challenges the idea that mental states are constitutively linked to behavior, which is a central tenet of neobehaviorism. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat does make sense. What is a key takeaway from Putnam-style cases, such as Strawson's weather watchers, regarding neobehaviorism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne key takeaway from Putnam-style cases, such as Strawson's weather watchers, is that these cases challenge the view that the nature of almost all, if not all, mental states is constitutively linked to behavior. In other words, these cases suggest that mental states can exist independently of behavior, which poses a problem for neobehaviorism. Do you have any further questions about this topic?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the different perspectives on the nature of the mind. What is a problem with mainstream functionalism, according to the case of Strawson's weather watchers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Strawson's weather watchers, mainstream functionalism, which is a form of neobehaviorism, is incompatible with the possibility of sentient creatures that have mental states but lack relevant behavioral components. In other words, the case of Strawson's weather watchers shows that mainstream functionalism cannot account for the existence of mental states in the absence of behavior, which is a problem for this view. Does that clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nI've also come across the idea of super-super-spartans and how they relate to our understanding of the mind. According to Putnam, how do physical experiences relate to mental states?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Putnam, the super-super-spartans' pain is related to their beliefs, desires, etc., in much the same way as ours is. In other words, Putnam is suggesting that mental states, such as pain, are not solely tied to behavior, but rather can exist independently of behavior and are related to our internal experiences and thoughts. This idea is an important contribution to our understanding of the mind and its relationship to the body. Does that help clarify the relationship between physical experiences and mental states?"}
