{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " Try to turn inwards away from the black text itself and focus on the blackness of your experience. What happens when you do? Does your attention slip through to the blackness of the text before you? Can you keep it from doing so and focus on the blackness of your experience itself, rather than the blackness of the text? DISCUSSION The example of Eloise comes from Gilbert Harman (1990), but other representationalists use similar examples to make the same point (see, e.g., Tye 1995, p. 30). This point about attention seems to have been first noticed by G. E. Moore, who claimed that, when we’re having a blue experience and we “try to introspect the sensation of blue, all we can see is the blue: the other element is as if it were diaphanous” (1903, p. 25). In line with this notion of diaphanousness, contempo- rary philosophers talk of the transparency of experience, and they tend to take examples like Eloise to establish what’s often referred to as the transparency thesis. According to this thesis, experience is transparent in the way that a pane of glass is transparent. Just as we see right through a pane of glass to whatever is on the other side of it, we “see” right through our experience to whatever it is representing. PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 112 Though transparency has been most commonly discussed with respect to visual experience, many philosophers take it to be true for perceptual experiences generally (Tye 1995). For example, Clare Batty (2010) has argued that olfactory experience is transparent. On her view, when we’re having an olfactory experience, the properties we’re smelling are presented to us as out in the world or as around us. Granted, we might not always know what object in particular has produced the relevant odor.

Can you directly attend to the blackness of your experience, or do you necessarily see through it to whatever it is representing?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's an interesting question. According to the transparency thesis, experience is transparent in the way that a pane of glass is transparent, so you do see right through your experience to whatever it is representing. This idea suggests that our experience is not a veil or a barrier between us and the world, but rather a way of directly accessing and perceiving the world around us.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What does the transparency of experience suggest about the relationship between experience and the external world?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe transparency of experience suggests that experience is not a barrier between us and the external world, but rather a transparent window through which we can see and perceive the world directly. It implies that our experience is a direct and immediate way of accessing the world, rather than a mediated or indirect one.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to explore this idea further. Is the transparency of experience limited to visual experiences, or can it be found in other types of experiences as well?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhile transparency has been most commonly discussed with respect to visual experience, many philosophers take it to be true for perceptual experiences generally, including olfactory (smell) experiences. According to this view, when you try to attend to an olfactory experience, you \"smell\" through that experience directly to the world, even if not to particular external objects in the world.\n\n**User:**\nJust to clarify, when you try to attend to an olfactory experience, what happens according to this view?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the view that olfactory experience is transparent, when you try to attend to an olfactory experience, you directly experience the world through that experience, without any mediation or indirectness. You smell through that experience directly to the world, rather than experiencing a mental representation of the smell. Does that help clarify the idea?"}
