{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " Whenever we use ordinary language meaningfully, there are multiple, mutually inconsistent things that our words could mean, and there is no fact of the matter about which of those things is correct. Quine uses the case we consider in this chapter to help motivate these startling results. THE CASE Imagine that you’re an explorer in an unfamiliar place. You come across a tribe of people who speak a language that is wholly un- known to you. You try to write a translation manual that translates sentences of their language into English. They say “Gavagai!” when a rabbit scurries by. What does that translate into, in English? “There goes a rabbit!”? At first, that seems reasonable. After all, that’s what you’d probably say if you retained your mastery of English but found yourself in the position of the person saying “Gavagai!” But then you realize that there are other possibilities—for exam- ple, “There goes an undetached part of a rabbit!” and “There goes a temporal stage in a rabbit’s life history!” And you remind yourself that you’re concerned with what the people of the tribe mean, not with what you yourself might have said. Still, you think, it was an actual rabbit that scurried by, not merely an undetached rabbit part or a rabbit stage. But then you remember two other things. First, the translation manual should concern “Gavagai!” as that sentence is used generally, not just on this one occasion. For that reason, you shouldn’t assume that the fact that there was actually a rabbit present plays an es- sential role in determining the sentence’s meaning. The same sentence might be prompted by, for example, seeing a cleverly disguised fake rabbit. Second, you’re concerned with meaning in an objective, scien- tific sense. You realize that, as Quine (1960, p. 31) puts it, the relevant stimulus for the utterance of “Gavagai!” is “the pattern of chromatic irradiation of the eye” that the rabbit-sighting caused in the person you are observing—a pattern that might as easily have been caused by a fake rabbit.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the objective, scientific meaning of \"Gavagai!\"?", "answer": "The objective, scientific meaning of \"Gavagai!\" is the pattern of chromatic irradiation of the eye that triggers the utterance of the word, regardless of whether the stimulus is a real rabbit or a fake one.

This meaning is not subjective or dependent on personal interpretation, but rather is an objective fact about the word's usage.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the relevant stimulus for the utterance of \"Gavagai!\"?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThe relevant stimulus for the utterance of \"Gavagai!\" is the pattern of chromatic irradiation of the eye that the rabbit-sighting caused in the person being observed. This means that the word \"Gavagai!\" is triggered by a specific visual stimulus, which could be caused by a real rabbit or a fake one.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhy should a translation manual of the language consider the meaning of \"Gavagai!\" in a general sense, rather than just focusing on a specific instance of the word being used?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThe translation manual should consider the meaning of \"Gavagai!\" in a general sense because it is concerned with how the word is typically used, and not just how it is used on a particular occasion.

Can you tell me the objective, scientific meaning of the word \"Gavagai!\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe word \"Gavagai!\" might seem mysterious, but it has a very specific meaning. From a scientific perspective, the objective meaning of \"Gavagai!\" is the pattern of chromatic irradiation of the eye that triggers the utterance of the word, regardless of whether the stimulus is a real rabbit or a fake one. This meaning is based on the stimulus that causes the word to be spoken.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What is the relevant stimulus for the utterance of \"Gavagai!\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe relevant stimulus for the utterance of \"Gavagai!\" is the pattern of chromatic irradiation of the eye that the rabbit-sighting caused in the person being observed. This means that the word \"Gavagai!\" is triggered by a specific visual stimulus, which could be caused by a real rabbit or a fake one. It's not necessarily about the actual presence of a rabbit.\n\n**User:**\nI see. It looks like understanding the general meaning of \"Gavagai!\" is important for a translation manual of the language. Why should a translation manual consider the meaning of \"Gavagai!\" in a general sense, rather than just focusing on a specific instance of the word being used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA translation manual should consider the meaning of \"Gavagai!\" in a general sense because it's concerned with how the word is typically used, and not just how it's used on a particular occasion. This approach helps to ensure that the translation is accurate and applicable in various contexts, such as when someone is looking at a fake rabbit. It's essential to think beyond individual instances and consider the broader usage of the word.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But I've also heard that translating the word \"Gavagai!\" is challenging. What's the problem in translating the word \"Gavagai!\" from an unknown language into English?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main challenge is that there are multiple possible meanings for the word \"Gavagai!\", including \"There goes a rabbit!\", \"There goes an undetached part of a rabbit!\", or \"There goes a temporal stage in a rabbit's life history!\" It's unclear what the actual meaning of the word is, and it's not possible to determine the correct translation based on a single occurrence of the word. This ambiguity makes translation a complex task."}
