In fact, the same issue will arise for any new words or phrases introduced. Let's take the example of a word like \"Bleeg\". Even with more observations, it's possible to come up with multiple translations that fit the observed data. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI think so. You're saying that the problem with determining the meaning of a word or phrase in a language is that the available evidence isn't enough to determine a single correct translation. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExactly. The available evidence, such as patterns of stimuli and verbal responses, is insufficient to determine a single correct translation. There are multiple possible translations that are equally compatible with the observed evidence. This is the core issue that makes the problem of translation so challenging.\n\n**User:**\nSo, what do you conclude about the meaning of words and phrases in a language?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI conclude that the meaning of words and phrases in a language is indeterminate, meaning that there is no single correct translation or interpretation. It's not just a matter of not knowing the meaning; it's that the meaning itself is inherently uncertain and context-dependent.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a pretty profound conclusion. What are the implications of the indeterminacy of translation for language in general?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe implications are significant. The indeterminacy of translation is not limited to unknown languages, but applies to all languages, including English. Even native speakers who are trying to make a translation manual from English to their own language would arrive at the same indeterminate conclusions about English. This means that language is inherently subjective and context-dependent, and that meaning is not fixed or determinate."}
