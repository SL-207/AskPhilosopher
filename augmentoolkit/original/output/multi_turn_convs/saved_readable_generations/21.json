{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " Molyneux’s Problem 187 Very generally, philosophers of an empiricist bent who believe that our ideas and concepts stem from sensory experience alone tend to answer Molyneux’s question in the negative. Because visual and tactile experiences of shape are distinct, and the newly sighted person hasn’t learned to associate the visual experience of shapes with tactile ex- periences of shapes, they would not be able to identify which object was a cube and which was a sphere. Molyneux himself thought this, and Locke and Berkeley agreed. Rationalists like Leibniz, however, answered in the affirmative: given the ability to reason about the sen- sations, the newly sighted person could tell which object was which. Reid in some ways splits the difference. Though the visual and tactile sensations themselves do not resemble each other (or the objects they represent), they give rise to ideas that can be seen to relate to one another (see Van Cleve 2007).

According to Evans, both visual and tactile concepts share an egocentric representa- tion of space, depicting things as oriented around the subject, and so a subject should be able to make the transition between them. Accord- ing to Campbell, our experiences are externally individuated—that is, experiences are the same or different based on the properties they represent in the world (see Chapters 19 and 20); and so, if two expe- riences really were of the same property, they would share a way of appearing.

Can you explain what it is and how empiricist philosophers generally answer it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMolyneux's Problem is a question about whether a person who is blind from birth and gains sight for the first time can identify shapes through sight alone. Empiricist philosophers generally answer this question in the negative, believing that the person would not be able to associate visual experiences of shapes with tactile experiences of shapes. This is because empiricists believe that knowledge comes from experience and that our understanding of the world is based on sensory information. In this case, the person's understanding of shapes would have been developed through tactile experiences, and they would not be able to automatically associate visual experiences of shapes with the tactile ones they already know.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've heard that Molyneux himself, as well as other philosophers like Locke and Berkeley, have all answered Molyneux's Problem in the negative. Is that correct?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, that's right. Molyneux, Locke, and Berkeley have all answered Molyneux's Problem in the negative, believing that the person would not be able to identify shapes through sight alone. They believed that the person would need to learn to associate visual experiences of shapes with the tactile ones they already know, rather than being able to automatically recognize them.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that rationalists like Leibniz have argued that the person could actually identify shapes through sight alone. What was their key argument in favor of this position?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLeibniz argued that given the ability to reason about sensations, the newly sighted person could tell which object was which by using their understanding of the relationships between sensations. In other words, they believed that the person's understanding of the world could be used to inform their visual recognition of shapes, rather than relying solely on sensory information.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also been reading about the work of Gareth Evans on this topic. According to him, what do both visual and tactile concepts share?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Evans, both visual and tactile concepts share an egocentric representation of space, depicting things as oriented around the subject. This means that both visual and tactile concepts are centered on the individual's own perspective and orientation in the world.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that clears things up. I've also heard that there's a real-life example of a patient whose sight was restored by William Cheselden. What did that patient report being unable to do?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Cheselden, once vision was restored the patient was unable to distinguish shapes visually. This provides some concrete evidence to support the empiricist view on Molyneux's Problem, and suggests that the person's tactile experiences of shapes do not automatically translate to visual experiences.\n\nI hope that helps clarify things for you! Do you have any other questions about Molyneux's Problem or related topics?"}
