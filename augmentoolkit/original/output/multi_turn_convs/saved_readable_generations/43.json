What is the main problem for the identity theory when it comes to accounting for both mad pain and Martian pain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe identity theory posits that mental states are identical to physical states in the brain. However, this raises a challenge when considering pain experiences. One issue is that it seems to exclude the possibility of Martian pain (e.g. Marty's pain) because Marty lacks c-fibers, which are the physical basis for pain in humans. At the same time, the identity theory seems to easily account for mad pain (e.g. Maddy's pain), as Maddy feels pain just like everyone else, even though her c-fiber stimulation is causally connected to other parts of her neural system in atypical ways. This discrepancy creates a problem for the identity theory.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Now I'm trying to understand how a physicalist theory can account for both the possibility of mad pain (e.g. Maddy's pain) and the possibility of Martian pain (e.g. Marty's pain).\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne way a physicalist theory can account for both possibilities is by adopting an analytic functionalist approach. This involves two main components. First, we characterize the concept of pain in terms of its typical causal role. This means defining the concept of pain based on its usual cause-and-effect relationships. Second, we identify pain itself with whatever state plays that typical causal role.\n\nFor example, if c-fiber stimulation plays the pain role in typical humans, then human pain is identical to c-fiber stimulation. Similarly, if a certain hydraulic state plays that role in typical Martians, then Martian pain is identical to that hydraulic state. By focusing on the functional role of pain rather than its specific physical basis, we can account for both mad pain and Martian pain within a physicalist framework.\n\nDoes that clarify the issue for you?"}
