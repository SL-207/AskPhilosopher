Can you conceive of a glass of water that contains no hydrogen? If so, what does this imply about the concept of water?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, I can conceive of a glass of water that contains no hydrogen. This implies that there is nothing about the concept of water that prevents us from conceiving of hydrogen-free water. However, this does not necessarily mean that such a thing is metaphysically possible. It's an interesting thought experiment that challenges our understanding of what water is.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a fascinating idea. I've also been exploring the concept of zombies in philosophy, particularly in the context of David Chalmers' discussion of ideal conceivability. I'm wondering what the key difference is between conceiving of hydrogen-free water and conceiving of a zombie world.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe key difference is that hydrogen-free water is ideally conceivable only if we fail to consider some of the world's physical features, such as water's chemical composition. On the other hand, a zombie world duplicates all of the actual world's physical features, making it harder to explain why a zombie world is ideally conceivable. This distinction is relevant to discussions of the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem.\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the phenomenal concept strategy, which attempts to explain the ideal conceivability of a zombie world. How do phenomenal concept strategists explain the ideal conceivability of a zombie world?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPhenomenal concept strategists attribute the ideal conceivability of a zombie world not to distinctive features of consciousness itself, but rather to distinctive features of how we think about consciousness - namely, to phenomenal concepts. These concepts are thought to be built in such a way that they imply the independence of consciousness from physical and functional features. This approach attempts to reconcile the idea that a zombie world is ideally conceivable with the notion that such a world is not metaphysically possible.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a compelling explanation. Finally, I'm wondering if a zombie world can be metaphysically possible if it is ideally conceivable, according to the phenomenal concept strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf the phenomenal concept strategy succeeds, then we can accept the intuition that a zombie world is ideally conceivable without it entailing that such a world is metaphysically possible. This seems to be a way to \"have our cake and eat it too\" - accepting the conceivability of a zombie world without accepting its metaphysical possibility. It's a nuanced and complex issue, and the phenomenal concept strategy offers a thought-provoking way to approach these questions."}
