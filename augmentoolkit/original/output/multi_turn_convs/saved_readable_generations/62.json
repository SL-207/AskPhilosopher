You PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 80 would have found some confirmation that all jadeite is green; but, because of the disunified nature of jade as a kind, you can’t conclude anything about other instances of jade from your evidence—they might be nephrite and you don’t know anything about nephrite! In particular, you don’t know that all—or indeed any—nephrite is green.

What does a natural kind need to be in order to be suitable for inclusion in scientific laws?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen it comes to scientific laws, a natural kind is something that has enough unity as a kind for observations about one instance to bear on observations about all instances of the kind. This means that there must be some underlying causal similarity between the different instances of the kind. Think of it like a category, but one that's based on a shared underlying property or mechanism. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, it does. And I've also been wondering about a specific example, jade. You might know that it's actually made up of two different minerals, nephrite and jadeite. The question I have is: what's the problem with treating jade as a disjunctive kind for the purposes of scientific laws?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen we treat jade as a disjunctive kind, we're essentially saying that it's composed of two different kinds of minerals. The problem with this is that because jade is disjunctive, there's no unity to the kind. As a result, observations about one instance of jade (e.g. that it is green) don't provide any information about other instances of jade, because they may be made of a different mineral (nephrite). This makes it difficult to make generalizations about jade as a whole, which is what we need for scientific laws.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. And finally, I was wondering: can a disjunctive kind, such as jade, be treated as a regular kind for the purposes of scientific laws?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, a disjunctive kind like jade cannot be treated as a regular kind. This is because there's no guarantee of any causal similarity between the different components of the disjunctive kind, which means that observations about one instance of the kind may not bear on observations about other instances. In other words, since jade is composed of two different minerals, we can't rely on observations about one instance of jade to make predictions about other instances. Does that clear things up?"}
