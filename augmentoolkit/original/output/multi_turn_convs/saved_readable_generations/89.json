Proponents of the knowledge and conceivability arguments argue that there are disanalogies between those arguments and the historical precedent of Broad's argument. Specifically, they claim that Broad's argument concerns structural truths (about chemical bonding and physical properties) that can be fully expressed in an abstract, mathematical language, whereas the knowledge argument concerns phenomenal truths (about consciousness) that may not be fully expressible in such a language. Do you have any further questions about these arguments or their differences?\n\n**User:**\nActually, yes. I'd love to know more. What historical precedent does Stoljar cite in relation to these arguments?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nStoljar cites the example of C. D. Broad's argument in 1925, which claimed that there were irreducible truths about chemical bonding. However, this argument was later shown to be unsustainable in light of the quantum-mechanical theory of chemical bonding, which was not widely known at the time. This precedent highlights the importance of being aware of current scientific knowledge and its potential to impact philosophical arguments.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've been trying to understand why the knowledge and conceivability arguments may appear forceful, but are ultimately flawed. What is the primary reason for this, according to Stoljar?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nStoljar argues that the knowledge and conceivability arguments owe their apparent force to ignorance - ignorance of physical facts that are currently unknown. This means that the arguments may rely on incomplete or inaccurate information, rather than any fundamental flaw in the nature of reality. This perspective encourages humility in understanding the nature of reality and acknowledges the limitations of human knowledge.\n\n**User:**\nI really appreciate the context you've provided for me. I've also come across a story involving a slug, I believe it was Jackson's use of the slug example. Can you tell me what lesson or moral can be derived from that story?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe moral or lesson that can be derived from Jackson's use of the slug example is humility in understanding the nature of reality. Jackson's slugs are portrayed as \"tough-minded slugs\" who incorrectly believe that their science can explain all of nature, highlighting the limitations of human knowledge. This story serves as a reminder to approach philosophical and scientific questions with humility, acknowledging the complexities and uncertainties of the world around us."}
