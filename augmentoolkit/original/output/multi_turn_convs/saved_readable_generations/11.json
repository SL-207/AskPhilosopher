{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " A zombie world is ideally conceivable (that is, conceivable on ideal reflection). 2.

If a zombie world is metaphysically possible, then physicalism is false. CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 40 Conclusion: physicalism is false. The features of consciousness that distinguish you and your zom- bie twin are sometimes called “phenomenal properties” or “qualia”. Zombies lack qualia. For that reason, zombie cases are sometimes de- scribed as “absent qualia” cases (see Chapter 16). DISCUSSION Some respond to the zombie argument by rejecting physicalism and exploring non-physicalist alternatives, such as dualism (Chalmers 1996; see Chapter 4). Others respond by rejecting one or more of the zombie argument’s three main premises. Though all three premises have been challenged, most accept the third and reject either the first or the second (though for a challenge to the third, see Montero 2013, and for a reply see Alter 2023). The discussion tends to get pretty technical. But the basic ideas are fairly intuitive. To reject the first premise is to deny that a zombie world is ideally conceivable. Sometimes something seems conceivable at first, but on reflection we realize we are just confused. Recall an example from Chapter 3. In objecting to Descartes’ conceivability argument, Ar- nauld (1641) suggests that someone might be able to conceive of a right triangle that doesn’t conform to the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of its sides is slightly greater than its hypotenuse squared.

What does it mean for a physicalist to say that a zombie world is metaphysically possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe zombie argument is a thought experiment that challenges physicalism, the idea that everything can be explained by physical processes. If a physicalist says that a zombie world is metaphysically possible, it means that physicalism is false. This is because a zombie world by definition lacks consciousness and qualia, which are essential aspects of conscious experience.\n\n**User:**\nI think I know what qualia are, but just to confirm, what are \"qualia\" or \"phenomenal properties\" in the context of consciousness?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the context of consciousness, \"qualia\" or \"phenomenal properties\" refer to the unique features of consciousness that distinguish one person from another, such as the subjective experience of sensations, emotions, and thoughts. Zombies, by definition, lack these qualia.\n\n**User:**\nI understand now that the zombie argument is a challenge to physicalism. How do some philosophers respond to the zombie argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSome philosophers respond to the zombie argument by rejecting physicalism and exploring non-physicalist alternatives, such as dualism. Dualism is the idea that the mind and body are separate entities, rather than being composed of the same physical substance.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to dig deeper into the zombie argument. What is the main challenge to the first premise of the zombie argument?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main challenge to the first premise is to deny that a zombie world is ideally conceivable, either by arguing that it is not clear and distinct, or by suggesting that it makes no sense even after careful reflection.\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the concept of \"ideally conceivable\" in the context of a zombie world. What is meant by that phrase?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen something is \"ideally conceivable\", it means that it is conceivable after careful and thorough reflection, with clear and distinct concepts. In other words, it is something that makes sense and is not based on confused or unclear ideas. In the context of the zombie argument, ideally conceivability implies that it is possible to imagine a world without qualia or consciousness, without feeling that it is somehow incoherent or nonsensical. Does that help clarify the concept?"}
