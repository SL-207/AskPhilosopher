Why does it seem implausible to suppose that you attend to your afterimage experience by attending to the red dot?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt seems implausible because we don't take there to be any red dot actually on the paper, which suggests that the afterimage experience is not a direct result of attending to the red dot. Think of it like this: when you stare at a green dot for a while, you'll see a red dot on a white paper after you shift your attention. It's clear that the afterimage experience isn't caused by the red dot itself. Does that help clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've actually experienced something similar. What happens to your visual experience when you stare at a picture of a green dot for about half a minute and then shift your attention to a blank piece of white paper?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou will visually experience a red dot on the paper similar in size and location to the green dot you had been staring at. This is a common phenomenon, and it shows how our visual system can create an afterimage even when there's no actual stimulus present. Our brains are complex, right?\n\n**User:**\nYes, they certainly are! I've also been wondering about the relationship between attending to an experience and what that experience represents. Is it impossible to attend to the experience itself independent of what the experience represents when experience is strongly transparent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, when experience is strongly transparent, it is impossible to attend to the experience itself independent of what the experience represents. This is because our brains tend to focus on the object or stimulus rather than the experience itself. It's as if the experience is transparent, and we're more interested in what's on the other side.\n\n**User:**\nThat's an interesting point. What about when experience is weakly transparent? Is it possible to attend to the experience itself independent of what the experience represents, even then?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, with appropriate introspective effort, we can attend to the experience itself independent of what the experience represents, even when experience is weakly transparent. This requires a bit more mental discipline, but it's possible to shift our focus from the external stimulus to the internal experience.\n\n**User:**\nLast question for now. When you put on your glasses and can now read a text that had appeared blurry to you before, what happens to the phenomenal character of your experience?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe phenomenal character of your experience changes from blurry to clear (or, at least, clearer). It's as if the glasses have swapped out the blurry experience for a sharp one, giving you a more accurate representation of the world. This highlights how our experiences can be shaped by our circumstances and whether we have the right tools or information to understand them."}
