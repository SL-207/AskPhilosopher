What is an example of a common sensible that can be perceived by multiple senses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that. Shape is a paradigm case of a common sensible that can be perceived by both vision, through seeing the outline of a body, and touch, through feeling the edges of a body. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that makes sense. I was thinking about shapes, but I didn't know there was a specific term for it. Now, I'm curious about something else. What is Molyneux's problem, and what is the basis for it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMolyneux's problem is an interesting issue related to perception and the senses. It involves the relationship between the different sensory representations of common sensibles. To be specific, the problem is about whether someone who has learned to distinguish between a cube and a sphere through touch, but has never seen them before, could know by sight alone which one was the cube and which one was the sphere. It's a classic thought experiment in the philosophy of perception.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a fascinating problem. I'm curious about the perspective of the person who has been blind since birth in this scenario. What is their claim about distinguishing between a cube and a sphere?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Molyneux's problem, the person who has been blind since birth has learned to distinguish between a cube and a sphere through touch. They have developed a sense of the texture and shape of these objects through their tactile experience, and are able to tell them apart based on feeling the corners of the cube and its six faces, and the smooth feeling of the sphere.\n\n**User:**\nI see. That's a great way to think about it. Now, I'm wondering about the classification of sensory representations. Are there different types of sensory representations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Aristotle, there are two main types of sensory representations. Some qualities are perceivable only by a single sense, while other qualities are \"common sensibles\" and can be perceived by multiple senses. This distinction is interesting because it highlights the different ways in which we experience the world through our senses. Does that make sense?"}
