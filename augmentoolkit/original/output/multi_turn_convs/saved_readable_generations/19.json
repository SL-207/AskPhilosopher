Representationalists answer this question in the affirmative, and they typically attempt to explain phenomenal consciousness in terms of intentionality. In an attempt to support their view, they often argue that when we attempt to attend to the phenomenal character of a given phenomenally conscious mental state, we have nothing to attend to except what the mental state represents. In this chapter we’ll consider a thought experiment put forth in an effort to support this claim about attention and its relationship to representationalism. 19 Eloise and the Tree 111 THE CASE Consider Eloise, who is in her front yard looking at an oak tree. As she looks at the canopy of leaves overhead, she is having a visual ex- perience with a greenish character; and, as she touches the bark, she is having a tactile experience with a rough, bumpy character. But now suppose that she tries to attend to her experience, its greenishness say. What happens? Though she is aiming to focus her attention inward, she can’t find any intrinsic features there on which to focus, and her attention slips through to the greenishness of the tree. An attempt to attend inward ends up being an act of outward attention. The color Eloise experiences is experienced as a feature of the tree.

Can you describe the scenario where Eloise is looking at an oak tree in her front yard?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLet's take a look at Eloise's experience. Eloise is in her front yard looking at an oak tree with its canopy of leaves overhead. As she looks at the tree, she is having a visual experience with a greenish character, and as she touches the bark, she is having a tactile experience with a rough, bumpy character.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a clear image. Now I'm curious about what happens when Eloise tries to attend to her visual experience, specifically its greenish character.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen Eloise tries to attend to her visual experience and its greenish character, her attention slips through to the greenishness of the tree, and she can't find any intrinsic features of her experience on which to focus. It's as if her attention is drawn to the underlying characteristic of the experience rather than the experience itself.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I have a related question. What happens if there's no tree nearby when you try to focus on your own experience?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEven if there's no physical tree nearby, you can still try to focus on your own experience. You might find that you're having an experience of the text and background, and if you try to focus on that experience, you might find that it slips through to the actual visual features of the text and background. It's an interesting phenomenon that can happen regardless of the external environment."}
