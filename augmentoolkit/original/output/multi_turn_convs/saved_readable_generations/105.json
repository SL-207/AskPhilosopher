Just as important, the special sciences discover unified types of phenomena that relate to each other in a lawlike manner.

How do they help?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe special sciences play a vital role in helping us comprehend complex events and phenomena that wouldn't be easily understood through the lens of physics alone. They discover new laws and generalizations that are predictively important, interesting, and counterfactually robust. In other words, they help us understand unified types of phenomena that relate to each other in a lawlike manner. This leads to a deeper understanding of the world around us. Do you have any further questions about the special sciences?\n\n**User:**\nActually, I'd love to know more about what makes a law \"counterfactually robust.\" What does that even mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to explain that. A counterfactually robust law is one that holds even if certain conditions or circumstances are not met. In other words, it is a law that is true regardless of what might have been the case. This concept is often used in philosophy to discuss the nature of laws and how they apply to different scenarios. The idea is that a robust law is one that remains valid even if we were to imagine a different set of circumstances or outcomes. Does that clarify things for you?"}
