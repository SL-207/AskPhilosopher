Specifically, it's asking whether a person who is born blind and has never experienced sight, but then gains sight, would be able to identify an object they have previously recognized through touch solely by looking at it.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I've also heard of Project Prakash, which was an attempt to study Molyneux's problem by giving sight to congenitally blind children. What's the current status of research on Molyneux's problem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDespite the criticisms of Project Prakash, research on Molyneux's problem is still ongoing. There have been various publications and discussions on the topic, including an entry in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and articles in other academic journals. It's a complex and debated topic, and researchers continue to explore its implications.\n\n**User:**\nI've read that Project Prakash did some experiments with children who had their sight restored. What were the results of that study?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFive congenitally blind children had their sight restored as part of Project Prakash. Despite previous familiarity with differently shaped Lego blocks through touch, the children were unable to visually identify these blocks after gaining sight. The results were somewhat unexpected and have been the subject of ongoing debate and discussion.\n\n**User:**\nSome people have criticized the results of Project Prakash. What are some of the criticisms they've made?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCritics argue that the results are inconclusive due to the fact that the visual systems of the patients may not have been fully functioning immediately after surgery. This could have led to the inability to identify the Lego blocks due to the inadequacy of the patient's visual system, rather than a fundamental difference between visual and tactile representations of space. It's a valid point, and the results of Project Prakash should be considered in light of this criticism. Do you have any more questions about Molyneux's problem or Project Prakash?"}
