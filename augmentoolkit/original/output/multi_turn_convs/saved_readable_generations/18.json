{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": " But what about high-level properties, such as being a table or being a horse? Are those ever represented in visual perception? Some think the answer is no: the categories of being a table and being a horse are not part of your visual perceptual content, which is limited to represent- ing low-level properties such as color and shape (e.g., Dretske 1995, Tye 1995, Clark 2000). According to this view, high-level categories are introduced only after perceptual processing is completed, by a different part of your cognitive system. Susanna Siegel (2006, 2010) 35 Pine Trees and Cyrillic Text 213 disagrees. According to what she calls the Rich Content View, high-level properties can, and often do, figure into perceptual content. Siegel’s main argument for that view appeals to examples of perception, in- cluding one involving pine trees and one involving Cyrillic text. THE CASES First example: you’ve been hired to cut down all the pine trees in a grove that contains many different sorts of trees. You don’t know what pine trees look like. Fortunately for you (though not for the pines), someone points out which trees are pines, and your ability to recog- nize pine trees improves over the following weeks. Eventually, you can spot them almost immediately. Second example: you look at a page filled with Cyrillic text, but you can’t read Russian. To you, what’s on the page are just meaningless squiggles and squoggles. Then you go about learning to read Russian, and eventually you succeed. The same page, with the Cyrillic text unaltered, looks notably different to you than it used to. When you started to learn, you had to attend to each letter separately, but now it actually takes effort to do that. You perceive the symbols as meaningful words and sentences.

Can high-level properties, such as being a table or being a horse, be represented in visual perception?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere are different opinions on this. Some people believe that high-level properties are not part of visual perceptual content, which is limited to representing low-level properties such as color and shape. Others, such as Susanna Siegel, argue that high-level properties can and often do figure into perceptual content. It's a topic of ongoing debate in the field of perception.\n\n**User:**\nI see. I was curious about the view that high-level properties are not part of visual perceptual content. What's the difference between that view and the Rich Content View?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe view that high-level properties are not part of visual perceptual content holds that high-level categories are introduced only after perceptual processing is completed, by a different part of your cognitive system. In contrast, the Rich Content View, which Susanna Siegel advocates, holds that high-level properties can and often do figure into perceptual content. So, the main difference is when and how high-level properties are integrated into our visual experience.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'd like to know more about the Rich Content View. Can you give me two examples that support the argument that high-level properties can be part of visual perceptual content?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOne example involves a person who is initially unable to recognize pine trees but can do so after being pointed out what pine trees look like. The other example involves a person who is unable to read Cyrillic text but can do so after learning to read Russian. In both cases, there is a notable change in what it's like for the person to perceive the same thing (a pine tree or some Cyrillic writing). These examples illustrate how high-level properties can be part of our visual experience.\n\n**User:**\nI'd like to think about that example. Describe a change that a person may experience when they are able to recognize pine trees for the first time.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen a person is able to recognize pine trees for the first time, they may experience an experiential shift, where they are able to spot pine trees almost immediately, and their ability to recognize them improves over time. It's not just a matter of identifying the trees, but also of seeing them in a new way, with a new kind of awareness."}
