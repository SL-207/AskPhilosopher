For example, Sally believes the proposition that her mother will send money.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is an example of a propositional attitude?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nAn example of a propositional attitude is believing a proposition, such as Sally believing that her mother will send money.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nCan someone have multiple attitudes towards the same proposition?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nYes, according to the SHOPPING LIST BACKGROUND, someone can have multiple attitudes towards the same proposition.\n", "conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've come across the term \"propositional attitudes\" and I'm not quite sure what it means. Can you explain it to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPropositional attitudes are the concept that involves ascribing an attitude towards a proposition, such as believing or doubting it. It's a way of describing how we think about and relate to different pieces of information or statements. For example, you might believe a certain statement is true, or you might doubt its validity. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI think so, but I'm still a bit confused. Can you give me a bit more context? I've come across something called the SHOPPING LIST BACKGROUND that's supposed to help explain it.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe SHOPPING LIST BACKGROUND is actually a useful resource for understanding propositional attitudes. It discusses how when we say someone believes something, we are ascribing to them an attitude towards a proposition, which can be true or false. For example, if Sally says \"I believe my mother will send money,\" we are ascribing the attitude of belief to Sally towards the proposition that her mother will send money. Does that help clarify things?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I think so. So, propositional attitudes are just about how we think about or feel about certain statements or propositions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExactly. And one example of a propositional attitude is believing a proposition. So, going back to the example of Sally, an example of a propositional attitude is Sally believing that her mother will send money. It's a way of describing her attitude towards that particular proposition.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. But what if someone has multiple thoughts or feelings about the same proposition? Can they have multiple attitudes towards the same proposition?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the SHOPPING LIST BACKGROUND, yes, someone can have multiple attitudes towards the same proposition. This means that a person can hold different attitudes towards the same statement or proposition, such as believing it, doubting it, or being unsure about it."}
