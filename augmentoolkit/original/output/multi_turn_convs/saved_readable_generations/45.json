In response to that sort of worry, he appeals to another doctrine: the rela- tivity of meaning and reference. In physics, a particle has a position and a velocity not in any absolute sense but only relative to a coordinate system. In Quine’s view, the same is true of meaning and reference.

In physics, the position and velocity of a particle are entirely determined by its relations to a coordinate system, whereas according to Quine's doctrine, meaning and reference are only relative to a specific language. However, it seems that there is more to meaning than just its relations to a language, suggesting that meaning itself is not entirely language-dependent.

How does Quine's doctrine lead to seemingly absurd consequences, and what is his response to these worries?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nQuine's doctrine leads to seemingly absurd consequences when one applies it to one's own words, suggesting that the meaning of those words is relative to a specific language and cannot be understood in an absolute sense. In response, Quine appeals to his doctrine of the relativity of meaning and reference, which suggests that meaning and reference are only relative to a specific language (or \"coordinate system\"). Does that make the connection clearer?\n\n**User:**\nI think it does, but I still have a few questions. Does rejecting behaviorism necessarily undermine the case for Quine's indeterminacy doctrine?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, rejecting behaviorism does not necessarily undermine the case for Quine's indeterminacy doctrine. Some philosophers, such as Donald Davidson, reject behaviorism but still accept Quine's indeterminacy doctrine or a related view about semantics. So, while there might be some tension between the two views, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n\n**User:**\nThe analogy between meaning and a coordinate system in physics is a helpful way to think about Quine's doctrine, but I'm not entirely sure what the main point of that analogy is.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe analogy suggests that meaning and reference are relative to a specific language (or \"coordinate system\") in the same way that the position and velocity of a particle are relative to a coordinate system in physics. It's a way of illustrating the idea that meaning is not an absolute, fixed concept, but rather something that is dependent on the language or system being used. I hope that helps clarify things!"}
