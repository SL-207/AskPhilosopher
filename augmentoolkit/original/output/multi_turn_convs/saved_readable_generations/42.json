I've been reading about Buddhism and came across a text that explores the concept of no-self. I was wondering what text it is and approximately when it is thought to have been written.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nHello! I'm happy to help you with your question. The Buddhist text that explores the concept of no-self is The Questions of King Milinda, also known as The Milinda Pañha. It is thought to have been written between 100 BCE and 200 CE. This text is a significant work in Buddhist philosophy, and it explores many themes related to the nature of reality and the self. Would you like to know more about The Milinda Pañha or its ideas?\n\n**User:**\nYes, please. What is the phenomenon discussed in The Milinda Pañha, and what are its ramifications for personal identity and the unity of consciousness?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe phenomenon discussed in The Milinda Pañha is not directly related to the concept of split brains, which is a real-life condition that results from a surgical procedure in which the brain's two hemispheres are disconnected from one another. Split brains have important ramifications for personal identity and the unity of consciousness, as they suggest that even when we feel like a single, unified self, our brain can be processing information independently in different hemispheres. However, this is not the main topic of discussion in The Milinda Pañha. The text actually explores the Buddhist concept of anatta, or no-self, which is a central idea in Buddhist philosophy. If you're interested in learning more about this topic, I'd be happy to help.\n\n**User:**\nActually, you mentioned split brains earlier, and I'm curious. What does a certain thought experiment suggest about the nature of thoughts and minds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSplit brains are actually relevant to a thought experiment that suggests thoughts and minds might be shared by more than one person. In the case of a split brain, the two hemispheres of the brain can process information independently, and in some cases, this can lead to situations where one hemisphere seems to be \"thinking\" or \"talking\" without the other hemisphere being aware of it. This can lead to some fascinating and even eerie phenomena, such as a person saying things that they don't remember saying. This thought experiment challenges our traditional notions of personal identity and the unity of consciousness, and it suggests that the relationship between thoughts and minds is more complex than we might have initially thought. Does that make sense?"}
