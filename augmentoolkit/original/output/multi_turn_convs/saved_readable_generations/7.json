DISCUSSION Dennett takes the coffee tasters thought experiment to reveal a deep incoherence in the traditional conception of qualia. We can’t really know what qualia we’re having, and we can’t really separate qualia from our reactions to them.

To defend this point, eliminativists often draw a comparison to our ordinary and intuitive understanding of physics.

Similarly, they argue that our intuitive conception of the mind also contains deep mistakes, and that we need to discard these mistaken posits in favor of a more scientific theory of mind.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is eliminativism, and how does it relate to the traditional notion of qualia?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nEliminativism is a philosophical view that rejects the traditional notion of qualia, as well as other aspects of folk psychology.

This challenges the traditional view of qualia as being independent and inherent.\n", "conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading up on some philosophical concepts, and I came across a comparison made by eliminativists. What is this comparison, and what implications does it have for our understanding of the mind?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe comparison made by eliminativists is to our ordinary and intuitive understanding of physics. They argue that just as our understanding of physics contains deep mistakes (like the idea that a heavier ball falls faster than a lighter one), our intuitive conception of the mind also contains deep mistakes. They propose that we need to discard these mistaken posits in favor of a more scientific theory of mind.\n\nThis has significant implications for our understanding of the mind. It suggests that our everyday understanding of consciousness, intentionality, and other mental phenomena may be fundamentally flawed. Eliminativists argue that we need to replace these intuitive conceptions with a more nuanced and scientifically informed understanding of the mind.\n\n**User:**\nI'm not sure I understand what eliminativism is. Can you explain it in the context of the traditional notion of qualia?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEliminativism is a philosophical view that rejects the traditional notion of qualia, as well as other aspects of folk psychology. It proposes that our ordinary and intuitive understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and misguided, and that we need to discard these mistaken posits in favor of a more sophisticated and scientific theory of mind.\n\nIn particular, eliminativists argue that the traditional notion of qualia – our subjective experiences of redness, sweetness, and other sensory qualities – is not supported by scientific evidence and should be eliminated from our philosophical vocabulary.\n\n**User:**\nI've also come across the concept of illusionism. What is it, and how does it relate to the concept of qualia?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIllusionism is a view that consciousness is an illusion, and that our experiences of qualia are not objective features of the world, but rather a product of our brain's processing of information. According to illusionism, our subjective experiences of qualia are not a direct reflection of the world, but rather a constructed interpretation of sensory data.\n\nThis view challenges the traditional notion of qualia as being objective and inherent, and instead suggests that our experiences of qualia are entirely subjective and constructed.\n\n**User:**\nDennett has argued that the traditional notion of qualia is incoherent. Can you summarize his main argument against it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDennett's main argument against the traditional notion of qualia is that we cannot truly know what qualia we are having, and cannot separate qualia from our reactions to them. He proposes that the concept of qualia be retired from philosophical discussion because it is inherently ambiguous and unsupportable.\n\nIn other words, Dennett argues that we cannot directly experience or know qualia in themselves, but only as they are filtered through our cognitive and perceptual systems.\n\n**User:**\nFinally, I've heard that qualia have a relational profile. What does this mean, and how does it impact our understanding of qualia?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf qualia have a relational profile, it means that they are not inherent or intrinsic, but rather are affected by our preferences and reactions. This challenges the traditional view of qualia as being independent and inherent.\n\nIn other words, the relational profile of qualia suggests that our experiences of qualia are not fixed or absolute, but rather are context-dependent and subjective. This has significant implications for our understanding of qualia, as it highlights the role of cognitive and perceptual processes in shaping our subjective experiences."}
