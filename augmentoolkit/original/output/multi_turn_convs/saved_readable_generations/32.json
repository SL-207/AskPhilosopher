What is that, exactly?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe causal exclusion problem is a challenging concept in the philosophy of mind, particularly for physicalists. It's a problem that arises because it seems that mental events, such as thoughts and desires, can cause physical events. This creates a paradox that physicalists need to address. In other words, if mental events can cause physical events, then it would seem that physical events are not being caused by physical events alone, but also by mental events. This is known as the causal exclusion problem. Does that make sense?"}
