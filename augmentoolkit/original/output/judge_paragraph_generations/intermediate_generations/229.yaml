    In the world of science, there are countless mysteries and phenomena that elude
    easy explanation. For instance, certain forces and energies interact in ways that
    are not fully understood, shaping the universe in subtle and profound manners.
    These interactions often occur at levels beyond human perception, leaving much
    to speculation and theory. Various scientific disciplines attempt to explain these
    interactions, each offering unique perspectives but often lacking definitive answers.

    \ terms of their functional roles, and states that have different functional roles\
    \ are thus classified as states of different types (see Chapters 15 and 16). A\
    \ state’s functional role is specified partly in terms of its cause, and so the\
    \ functional role of a color experience will be specified partly in terms of the\
    \ stimulation of the visual system (perhaps more specifically, the stimulation\
    \ of the retina). For example, when Cyndi sees a red apple and has a red experience,\
    \ her retina is stimulated. But Cyndi claims to have the same experience of red—an\
    \ experience that feels the same to her as the one she has when she sees a red\
    \ apple—when she hears bacon sizzling. In this case, there is a complete absence\
    \ of the relevant stimulation of the visual system. As we noted earlier, Cyndi’s\
    \ eyes may even be closed. Thus, even though these two experiences of red are\
    \ experientially the same, because they have different functional roles, functionalism\
    \ cannot classify them as the same kind of experience. In response to these worries,\
    \ various defenses of functionalism have been proposed. Some have argued that\
    \ more sophisticated versions of functionalism can escape the challenge from synesthesia\
    \ (Macpherson 2007), while others have argued that we should treat synesthetic\
    \ experience as a malfunction, and thus not take it to shed any light on a given\
    \ mental state’s typical functional role (Gray 2001). Other philosophers have\
    \ used related considerations to raise wor- ries about representationalist views\
    \ of consciousness—that is, the view that phenomenal character is nothing over\
    \ and above representational content (see, e.g., Wager 1999, Rosenberg 2004; see\
    \ Chapters 19 and 20). Here the problem seems to arise from the fact that mental\
    \ states can be the same representationally without being the same phenom- enally.\
    \ When a non-synesthete hears bacon sizzling and when Cyndi hears bacon sizzling,\
    \ the thought goes, the experiences have the same representational content (of\
    \ bacon sizzling), but Cyndi’s experience has “extra” phenomenal content.\n\"\"\
