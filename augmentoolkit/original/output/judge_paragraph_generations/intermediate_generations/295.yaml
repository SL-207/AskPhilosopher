    In the world of science, there are countless mysteries and phenomena that elude
    easy explanation. For instance, certain forces and energies interact in ways that
    are not fully understood, shaping the universe in subtle and profound manners.
    These interactions often occur at levels beyond human perception, leaving much
    to speculation and theory. Various scientific disciplines attempt to explain these
    interactions, each offering unique perspectives but often lacking definitive answers.
    The vastness of these mysteries spans from the minuscule quantum realm to the
    expansive cosmos, hinting at complexities that challenge our current understanding.

    \ THE ELUSIVE SELF BACKGROUND It is natural to think that each of us has, or is,\
    \ a self. There are not only our thoughts, feelings, and experiential states;\
    \ there is also something that has those states. This doesn’t seem to be just\
    \ a random assumption: we seem certain of its truth. In the western tradition,\
    \ Descartes in- sists that even given radical doubt about the existence of the\
    \ external world—including doubt that we have bodies—each of us can none- theless\
    \ be certain that we exist. Cogito ergo sum: I think therefore I am. On the face\
    \ of it, my knowledge that I exist doesn’t depend upon my knowledge about the\
    \ external world. And, whatever else my existence might involve, it involves the\
    \ existence of me—that is, my self. It seems natural to think that we know about\
    \ this self via introspection. But Hume (1739/1978), and long before him the Buddha,\
    \ questioned this claim. In their view, the self is in fact particularly elusive.\
    \ THE CASE Take a second and survey what you find in experience. Perhaps close\
    \ your eyes and draw up an inventory of what you find. You’re likely to find your\
    \ thoughts, for example, a thought such as “This is a weird exercise.” Perhaps\
    \ you’ll notice some bodily sensations like a pain in 46 PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY,\
    \ AND THE SELF 286 the back and a tickling in the nose. Maybe you’ll also find\
    \ auditory experiences of the sounds from the cars outside or the internal melody\
