    In the world of science, there are countless mysteries and phenomena that elude
    easy explanation. For instance, certain forces and energies interact in ways that
    are not fully understood, shaping the universe in subtle and profound manners.
    These interactions often occur at levels beyond human perception, leaving much
    to speculation and theory. Various scientific disciplines attempt to explain these
    interactions, each offering unique perspectives but often lacking definitive answers.
    The vastness of these mysteries spans from the minuscule quantum realm to the

    \ in terms of doxastic justification, we can treat the debate as concerning whether\
    \ or not there are requirements outside of having particular mental states that\
    \ determine whether someone justifiedly believes that p, aside from whatever is\
    \ required to satisfy the basing relation. Now that we have gotten sufficiently\
    \ clear on the focus of the in- ternalism/externalism debate, letâ€™s take a look\
    \ at the opposing sides. All versions of internalism are committed to mentalism,\
    \ and most forms of externalism are committed to the denial of mentalism (for\
    \ our purposes, we can set aside the complication of getting into the details\
    \ of externalist views that accept mentalism). Mentalism is the idea that any\
    \ two individuals that are exactly alike mentally are exactly alike in terms of\
    \ the propositional justification that they have. In other words, mentalism says\
    \ that there canâ€™t be a difference in terms of prop- ositional justification without\
    \ a difference in terms of mental states. So, if Earl and Rich differ in terms\
    \ of their propositional justification, say Rich is justified in believing that\
    \ p and Earl isnâ€™t, then there must 119 JUSTIFICATION be some mental difference\
    \ between Earl and Rich. And assuming that Earl and Rich both satisfy the requirements\
    \ of the basing relation, internalists insist that it canâ€™t be that one of them\
    \ justifiedly believes that p, but the otherâ€™s belief that p is unjustified unless\
    \ there is some mental difference between them. Externalism in all of its many\
    \ vari- eties denies mentalism. In other words, externalist views of epistemic\
    \ justification contend that Earl and Rich can be mental duplicates, i.e. exactly\
    \ alike in terms of all of their memories, experiences, ways of thinking, and\
    \ so on, and both satisfy the conditions necessary for the basing relation, and\
