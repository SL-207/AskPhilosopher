{"paragraph": " NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 46 RESPONSES The response favored by those who think the basing relation is a causal relation or a relation of counterfactual dependence is to simply deny that Saul knows (or even justifiedly believes that his client is in- nocent) (McCain 2012). This response holds that while Saul believes the right thing (that his client is innocent), he believes it for the wrong reasons (because the fortune-teller told him rather than because of his evidence). Yet another response to this case is to accept, as Lehrer does, that Saul knows that his client is innocent, while maintaining that this doesn\u2019t show that causal and counterfactual dependence relations are irrelevant to basing (Korcz 2000). This response contends that the example of Saul shows that causal or counterfactual dependence relations aren\u2019t necessary for basing, but they are sufficient. In other words, the heart of this response is the idea that the example of Saul shows that one can justifiedly believe that p, even if one\u2019s evidence doesn\u2019t cause one\u2019s belief that p (or one\u2019s belief doesn\u2019t counterfactu- ally depend upon one\u2019s evidence). Nevertheless, in cases where one\u2019s evidence does cause one\u2019s belief that p (or one\u2019s belief counterfactu- ally depends upon one\u2019s evidence), one justifiedly believes that p. Hence, this sort of response tries to find a middle ground between the causal/counterfactual view of the basing relation and the doxas- tic view of the basing relation by allowing that justifiedly believing requires either what the causal/counterfactual view says or what the doxastic view says.
