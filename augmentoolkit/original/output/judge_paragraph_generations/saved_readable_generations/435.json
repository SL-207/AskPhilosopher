{"paragraph": " It is perhaps easiest to understand permissivism by contrasting it with what is known as \u201cuniqueness\u201d. Uniqueness is the idea that for any particular set of ev- idence that evidence makes only one doxastic attitude (e.g. believing, disbelieving, or suspending judgment) toward p rational. For example, if E is the evidence in question and E makes believing p rational, then uniqueness says that any doxastic attitude toward p other than belief, when all the evidence one has is E, is irrational. Permissivism is the denial of uniqueness. It says that it is possible for the same body of evidence to support more than one doxastic attitude toward the same proposition. Hence, according to permissivism, even though E makes believing p rational, it might also make suspending judgment about p or believing not p rational too. How does this help with the issue at hand though? One way that accepting permissivism might help here is that one could plausibly acknowledge that if one were born somewhere else, one wouldn\u2019t believe that p, but insist that this doesn\u2019t make believing that p irrational. After all, if permissivism is true, then it could be that even given the same evidence, more than one doxas- tic attitude toward p can be rational. So, it might be that one\u2019s belief that p is rational, and also true that if one were born somewhere else that believing not p would be rational without this fact undermining the rationality of one\u2019s belief that p because the evidence can support either believing or not believing. A final sort of response involves distinguishing between various situations where the challenge that \u201cyou only believe that because\u2026\u201d arises. One might think that only some of these cases really pose a threat to one\u2019s knowledge/justification (Vavova 2018). For example, one might think that only to the extent that one faces this challenge and has independent reason to think that one is mistaken about the be- lief in question should one be worried about the belief that p.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
