{"paragraph": " To some it might seem that the last two are not in fact possibilities-that in fact it is impossible that any person or society be at once both civilized and morally corrupt or both uncivilized and morally good. This view is per\u00ad haps more widespread than at first one might think. People frequently refer to behavior they regard as grossly immoral as being uncivilized or barbaric, as though to be civilized is identical with being morally good. Such language, however, would seem to rest upon a confusion of being 1 98 The Nature of Value immoral with being uncivilized or barbaric. The opposite of being morally good is being morally corrupt, not being uncivilized or bar\u00ad baric, just as the opposite of being civilized is not being morally corrupt but rather being uncivilized or barbaric. If this is correct, to be civilized is one thing, to be morally good another, and a society and an individual person can be one without being the other. Just a little reflection should suffice to show that this is in fact the case. Since the Renaissance, European nations, and for the past two centuries also the United States, have COQ.tributed more to the develop\u00ad ment of the various arts and sciences, and thus to the development of civilization, than all other nations and societies taken together throughout the entire rest of the world. Yet throughout much of this historical period the internal social, political, and economic structure of these highly civilized nations has left much to be desired from a moral point of view. So also have their relations with one another and their treatment of people in other parts of the world who, within this histor\u00ad ical period, have contributed far less to the development of the arts and sciences. To take one example, from the first third of the eighteenth cen\u00ad tury to the first third of the twentieth, the German people contributed as much to the development of the arts and sciences as those of any other nation.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
