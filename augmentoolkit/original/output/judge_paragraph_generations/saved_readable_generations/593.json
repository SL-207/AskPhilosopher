{"paragraph": " So the evidence supports convicting him of a crime. However, when we learn that the odds are 99 to 1 that he stole the TV, we don\u2019t have that he stole the TV as evidence. Instead, we only have that it is 99% likely that he did. Finally, there is a response to the proof paradox that, unlike the first three responses, gives up on probabilism. On this way of looking at things, we shouldn\u2019t think that evidence justifies believing that p whenever it makes p sufficiently probable. Instead, we should think that evidence supports p when it is the case that something abnormal would be going on if the evidence obtained but p were false (Smith 2016, 2018). For example, if the eyewitness says that a blue bus hit Ginger but a blue bus didn\u2019t hit Ginger something strange would have occurred and it would require explanation. Did the eyewitness make a mistake, were they paid by Ginger, or something else? However, if the statistical evidence is simply that 85% of the buses are blue, but a blue bus didn\u2019t hit Ginger nothing needs to be explained.
