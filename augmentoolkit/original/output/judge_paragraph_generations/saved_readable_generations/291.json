{"paragraph": " Having a thought or feeling a pain is more like dancing a jig than holding an ace of spades. When one dances a jig, the jig is not some separate thing that is the object of the dance. It is inseparable from the dance and the dancer. You can\u2019t dance my (token) jig, but not because I\u2019m protective of my jigs. Rather, it would be a different jig if you danced it. You might well dance the same type of jig, just as you might have the same type of thought as I do. But you wouldn\u2019t be dancing the very same token jig or thinking the very same token thought. We might say that the jig is a way of dancing, or the pain is a way of feeling. These \u201cways\u201d are properties, not objects on their own, and as such they are individuated by the things that have them. That is, they are the specific token properties they are in part because of the subjects that have them. On this view, token thoughts and token conscious states cannot be shared by distinct subjects. The Vulcan mind meld is not a coun- terexample. A Vulcan doesn\u2019t really feel anyone else\u2019s token thoughts. Rather, they are having thoughts of the same type caused by the thoughts of another. Although the Vulcan and the subject of the mind meld are intimately connected, their thoughts are their own. On other views, token thoughts can be shared. Such a possibility might seem to be ruled out by the privacy of thoughts and conscious states. But that is not so clear. Privacy as defined above says that only subjects who have thoughts or conscious states can be aware of them in a certain way. That claim doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that two subjects can each have the same token thought, perhaps by sharing a mind or by being partially overlapping subjects. Take the jig case again. Although you can\u2019t dance my jig, suppose I have a conjoined twin with whom I share a leg. If we dance a jig, there seems to be a situation in which we are dancing the very same jig\u2014not just the same type of jig, but the same token jig.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
