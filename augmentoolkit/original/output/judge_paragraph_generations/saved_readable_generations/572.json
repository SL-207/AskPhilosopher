{"paragraph": " Antirealist views, which claim that all truths are knowable, are com- mitted to claiming that \u201cUNKNOWN is true and not known\u201d is knowable. In other words, antirealist views are committed to it be- ing possible for someone to know that UNKNOWN is true and at the same time to know that UNKNOWN is not known to be true. This follows given a very plausible principle known as \u201csingle prem- ise closure\u201d. Single premise closure says that if you know that \u201cp and q\u201d, then you know that p and you know that q. For instance, if you know that the ball is red and the bat is blue, then you know that the ball is red and you know that the bat is blue. Thus, it seems clear that antirealists are committed to claiming that someone can know that UNKNOWN is true and at the same time know that UNKNOWN is not known to be true. But, knowledge is factive. In other words, if someone knows that p, then p is true. In this case, it means that if someone knows that no one knows that UNKNOWN is true, then no one knows that UNKNOWN is true. However, this means that the antirealist position has led to a contradiction\u2014it is true that some- one knows that UNKNOWN is true and at the same time it is true that no one knows that UNKNOWN is true. Clearly, this can\u2019t be correct. If someone knows UNKNOWN is true, then it can\u2019t be that no one knows this. And, if no one knows UNKNOWN is true, then it can\u2019t be that some knows UNKNOWN is true. Let\u2019s take stock of things. We started with the assumption that there is something that is true but not known by anyone. We combined this assumption with the antirealist claim that all truths are knowable. Knowability Paradox 233 This combination along with single premise closure and the fact that knowledge entails truth led us straight to a contradiction. Thus, some- thing along the way must be false. But what? Single premise closure and that knowledge entails truth are nonnegotiable for pretty much all epistemologists.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
