{"paragraph": " Smith believes it. And, Smith\u2019s belief is justified because it is the result of a simple logical inference from other things he justifiedly believes. Thus, it seems like this is a case of a justified true belief that doesn\u2019t amount to knowledge. Let\u2019s consider another situation involving Smith and Jones as well as Smith\u2019s friend Brown. Smith has excellent reason to think that Jones owns a Ferrari. He\u2019s seen Jones driving a Ferrari. Jones has been telling everyone at the office that he owns a Ferrari. Being a bit of a snoop, Smith has noticed Jones looking at clubs for Ferrari owners on his computer. As a result of all of this information, Smith believes that Jones owns a Ferrari. Again, while sitting at his desk bored, Smith is thinking about his friend Brown. He knows that Brown is on vacation but has no idea where. Then, as often seems to be the case, Smith\u2019s thoughts turn to Jones and Jones\u2019 Ferrari. As he\u2019s sitting there, Smith decides to practice his logic skills to clear his head (it\u2019s a wonder he got the promotion given how he spends his time!). He thinks to himself \u201cJones owns a Ferrari,\u201d so \u201cJones owns a Ferrari or Brown is NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 8 in Bucharest.\u201d Then he thinks \u201cJones owns a Ferrari,\u201d so \u201cJones owns a Ferrari or Brown is in Baltimore.\u201d Smith continues, \u201cJones owns a Ferrari,\u201d so \u201cJones owns a Ferrari or Brown is in Boston.\u201d Finally, he reasons \u201cJones owns a Ferrari,\u201d so \u201cJones owns a Ferrari or Brown is in Barcelona.\u201d Smith believes each of these propositions because he believes that Jones owns a Ferrari, and he knows that disjunction in- troduction is a legitimate rule of logic. Now, let\u2019s add a twist to this situation as well. Let\u2019s assume that Jones doesn\u2019t actually own a Ferrari at all. Jones has been renting a Ferrari and doing everything possible to make it seem like he owns a Ferrari because he wants everyone at the office to think that he\u2019s doing great despite not getting the recent promotion.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
