{"paragraph": " Those who defend the soul theory suggest that a person\u2019s identity over time consists in the continued existence of the same soul. Those who defend the psycho- logical theory suggest that a person\u2019s identity over time consists in psychological facts, such as memory connections. Those who defend the physical theory suggest that a person\u2019s identity over time consists in physical facts, such as having the same body. The upload scenario is often proposed as support for the psychological theory. But, as we will see, it also raises a deep problem for such theories in virtue of the fact that the same upload process can be run multiple times at once, producing multiple manifestations of the original person. At present, mind uploading remains confined to the realm of sci- ence fiction. But some researchers think it is only a matter of time before it will be technologically feasible. The inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil (2005) predicts that we will be able to upload the brain to a computer or android body via a straightforward scan-and- transfer procedure sometime in the late 2030s. One promising avenue of research into mind uploading involves a process called whole brain emulation or WBE. As philosophers Anders Sandberg and Nick Bo- strom have suggested (2008, p. 5), though WBE \u201crepresents a formida- ble engineering and research problem,\u201d it appears to be an attainable goal; given currently existing technology, achieving WBE looks to be a matter just of additional extrapolation. Suppose, for example, that we had a \u201cconnectome\u201d\u2014a wiring diagram that maps out all of the neural connections in the brain (see Mandelbaum 2022). We would then have the kind of detail needed to create a software model of the brain; and, from there, the prospect of uploading capability does not seem far off.
