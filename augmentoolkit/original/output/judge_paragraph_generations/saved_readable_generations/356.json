Smith be- lieves it, and his belief is justified. But, again, it seems that we have a situation where Smith\u2019s justified true belief doesn\u2019t amount to knowledge. Hence, it appears that the traditional account of knowl- edge fails. Examples of the sort discussed in this entry are known as \u201cGettier\u201d cases because Edmund Gettier was the first person to really emphasize that such cases pose a threat to the traditional account of knowledge (though other philosophers had discussed such cases prior to Getti- er\u2019s discussion). Gettier cases, such as these, tend to follow a general pattern. In such cases, the subject has a justified belief, but as a result of bad luck their justification isn\u2019t tied to the truth of the proposition believed. However, as a matter of good luck, it turns out that what the subject believes is true. It is this correction of the bad luck by way of the later good luck that makes it so that there\u2019s always a twist to the stories depicted in Gettier cases. Before considering responses to these cases, it is worth noting something extraordinary about this purported counterexample to the traditional account of knowledge: almost all epistemologists agree that it works. That is to say, almost all epistemologists think that the tradi- tional account of knowledge is flawed. It is important to keep in mind though that what Gettier cases show is that justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge. The cases do not show that justified true be- lief isn\u2019t necessary for knowledge. In other words, Gettier cases make it clear that someone might have a justified true belief while failing to THE GETTIER PROBLEM 9 have knowledge. However, they don\u2019t demonstrate that one can have knowledge without having a justified true belief. In fact, most episte- mologists agree that justified true belief is necessary for knowledge.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
