{"paragraph": " Because of this, second\u00ad order phenomena may be said to build on first-order phenomena and third-order phenomena on those of the second-order. It is important that different levels of these phenomena be distin\u00ad guished from different, sometimes conflicting, likings, dislikings, valu\u00ad ings, and evaluations at the same level of the same thing by the same or by different persons, whether from the same or from different points of view and whether in the same or in different respects. Such different likings, dislikings, valuings, and evaluations can occur at any of the three levels we have distinguished. Thus I might like, you might dislike, and he might neither like nor dislike looking at the accident victims of our example, and at different times I might like, dislike, and neither like nor dislike looking at accident victims. Such likings, dislikings, and 10 The Nature of Value neither-likings-nor-dislikings are all at the first-order level. Similarly, I might not be ashamed of my liking to look at accident victims whereas you, being my wife, might be ashamed of my liking to do so. And I at first might not be ashamed of my liking to look at such victims and later come to be ashamed of my liking to do so. My not being ashamed and your being ashamed of my liking to do so are both second-order phenomena. Again, I might not regard my not being ashamed as inap\u00ad propriate whereas you do regard it as being such. And I for a time might not regard my not being ashamed_ as inappropriate and later come to regard it as being so. My not regarding my not being ashamed as inappropriate and your regarding it as such are both third-order phenomena. These examples, I think, suffice to show that different lik\u00ad ings, dislikings, valuings, and evaluations on the part of the same or of different persons at the same or at different times can occur at the same level, whether it be at the first, the second, or the third level.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
