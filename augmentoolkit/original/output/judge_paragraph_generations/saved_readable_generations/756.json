{"paragraph": " Even if, however, the belief that God exists be false and the holding of that belief by someone be intrinsically bad, such belief might be so central to a person's life that its loss by him would have conse\u00ad quences the intrinsic badness of which would be incalculably greater than those of his continuing to hold it. If so, we must not treat lightly the loss of such belief by such persons and must take care not to cause its loss by what we say and do. The same point, or at least one similar, is made eloquently by J. N. Findlay in these words: \"The whole security and moral progress of many persons is inwrought with the maintenance of their religion, and to subvert the latter is to menace the former. Respectful tolerance and abstinence from words and deeds that will cause religious shock or dismay, are plainly in most cases as obligatory as any abstinence from physical violence.\" 1 It is perhaps important to emphasize that the preceding is in no way incompatible with the view that the possession of true belief and knowl\u00ad edge can, and sometimes does, have intrinsic value. This is the case even if we disagree with philosophers such as W. D. Ross, who seems to regard any instance of knowledge, regardless of however trivial it might be, as being intrinsically good, 2 and Brentano, who seems to regard even the having of an idea, regardless of however trivial it be, as being intrinsically good. 3 Whether having true belief and knowledge is intrin\u00ad sically good depends upon what it is that is believed or known. If what is believed or known is trivial, believing or knowing it is also trivial and has no intrinsic value, regardless of how many trivial true beliefs and bits of knowledge one might accumulate. One might go even further and maintain that the having of a given true belief or piece of knowledge can never be in itself intrinsically good but instead at best can be only extrinsically good as a means to or as contributing to increasing our understanding of some aspect of man, the world, or God.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
