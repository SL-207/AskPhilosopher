{"paragraph": " The analogy, recall, was that one survives from day to day, throughout one\u2019s life or even beyond, by being like a candle\u2019s flame. This seems palatable until one considers some of the implications this seems to have for survival. We tend to think of reincarnation as a case in which one person passes away but is born again in a different body. The candle analogy is sup- posed to show how this might be possible without unchanging selves existing. But it might be troubling that, when a candle passes its flame to another, the first candle needn\u2019t go out\u2014it usually doesn\u2019t. Now consider the analogous case: your relevant mental features (memo- ries, personality, etc.) are incarnated in a distinct body while you are still alive, with your own mental states left intact. Most of us would not feel that we have been doubly incarnated. You\u2019re in one of those bodies, and someone with a frighteningly similar psychology is in the other body (see Chapter 39). A similar problem occurs because it seems possible for a candle to light three or four other candles at once. In the analogous case, then, your psychological characteristics (or whatever characteristics are supposed to pass between lives) are passed into three or four different bodies. We\u2019re not tempted to say The Chariot and the Candle 253 that there are now five of you. Each of these people is different from the other\u2014they could go on to have different experiences and know nothing of each other\u2014and none of them seem to be you, the candle that lit them all.
