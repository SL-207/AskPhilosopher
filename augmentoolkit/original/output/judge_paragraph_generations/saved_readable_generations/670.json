{"paragraph": " The exis\u00ad tence of God, however, would have both contributory and instrumental as well as intrinsic value, since His existence would contribute to the value of the all-inclusive whole of which He would be a part and also be a means to the existence of the created world, of which He is not a part. 4. Inherent Value Before concluding this chapter I should like to discuss briefly the con\u00ad cept of a species of value not heretofore mentioned. This is the concept of inherent value employed by C. I. Lewis. 6 For Lewis inherent value is a species of extrinsic value essentially distinct not only from intrinsic value but also from the two species of extrinsic value distinguished above-those of instrumental value and contributory value. For Lewis it is only experiences that can have intrinsic value. Those experiences, and only those, that are liked, pleasant, satisfying, or wanted are in\u00ad trinsically good; and those, and only those, that are disliked, un\u00ad pleasant, unsatisfying, or unwanted are intrinsically bad. For the sake of simplicity, I shall express this by saying that it is those and only Species of Value 5 3 those experiences that are liked that are intrinsically good and that it is those and only those that are disliked that are intrinsically bad. If ex\u00ad periences alone can have intrinsic value, the value of anything other than experiences can be only extrinsic. It does not, however, follow that their value must be either instrumental or contributory. Instead, something, x, can have instrumental or contributory value without having inherent value, and something else, y, can have inherent value without having instrumental or contributory value. The difference be\u00ad tween inherent value and these other two species of extrinsic value can be explained as follows. Suppose that a is a means to something else, b, of which a is not a part, and that a and b are not themselves experiences.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
