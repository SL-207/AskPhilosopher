{"paragraph": " Essentially, the idea behind this response to the Gettier Problem is that in addition to having a justified true belief it must also be the case that one\u2019s justification is not defeated in order for NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 10 one to have knowledge. The relevant sense of \u201cdefeat\u201d here concerns whether or not there are true propositions that if they were added to one\u2019s evidence would make it so that one no longer had justification. For example, there is a true proposition that if added to Smith\u2019s ev- idence would make it so that his belief that Jones owns a Ferrari or Brown is in Barcelona is unjustified. Specifically, the true proposition that Jones doesn\u2019t own a Ferrari would defeat Smith\u2019s justification. Since Smith\u2019s belief is defeasible in this way, this response rules it out as an instance of knowledge. A different kind of response involves adding modal conditions such as sensitivity or safety to the traditional account of knowledge. S\u2019s be- lief that p is sensitive just in case if p were false, S wouldn\u2019t believe that p (Dretske 1969, Nozick 1981). S\u2019s belief that p is safe just in case in the closest worlds to this one (\u201cclosest worlds to this one\u201d are ways that our universe could be different that are very similar to how the uni- verse actually is) where S believes that p, p is true (Sosa 1999). Smith fails to satisfy either a sensitivity or safety condition in these cases, so again adding these sorts of conditions seems to spare the traditional account from having to say that Smith knows. Finally, some respond to the Gettier Problem by claiming that it cannot be solved, and we should instead take knowledge to be un- analyzable (Williamson 2000). The thought here is that instead of try- ing to break knowledge down into components (such as justification, truth, and belief), we should take knowledge to be primitive and use it to understand other epistemic properties such as justification.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
