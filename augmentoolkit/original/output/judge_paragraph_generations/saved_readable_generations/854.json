{"paragraph": " This essay was his Discourse on the Arts and Sciences. The announced topic of the com\u00ad petition had already distinguished, at least implicitly, between the arts and sciences on the one hand and morality on the other, since the restoration of the arts and sciences necessarily would amount to the pu\u00ad rification of morals if there were no difference between the two. Rousseau accepted the distinction between the two and argued un\u00ad equivocally that the restoration of the arts and sciences, rather than tending to the purification of morals, had instead contributed to their corruption. In the process of doing so, he raised and essayed to answer a wider question concerning the relationship between civilization on the one hand and morality and justice on the other at any time and at any place, not just in Europe during the period in question. The distinction between civilization on the one hand and morality and justice on the other implicit in the question raised by the Academy at Dijon and made explicit by 'Rousseau can be explicated in the fol\u00ad lowing way. The. distinction applies both to societies and to individuals. A society is civilized to the degree to which the various arts and sciences are developed in it, morally good and just to the degree to which its cus\u00ad toms, institutions, and laws are such that each person within it, by acting in accordance with the latter, can promote his own welfare and become morally good. An individual person, on the other hand, is civi\u00ad lized to the degree to which he is knowledgeable about the various arts and sciences, morally good and just to the degree to which he acts in accordance with the requirements of morality. Given the preceding distinction between civilization and morality, there are various possible relationships between the two. It is possible that a society and an individual person be (a) both civilized and morally good, (b) neither civilized nor morally good, (c) civilized but not morally good, or (d) morally good but not civilized.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
