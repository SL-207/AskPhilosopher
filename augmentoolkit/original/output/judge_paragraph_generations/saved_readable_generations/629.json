{"paragraph": " Thus rather than speaking of facts in the first two senses of the term as being good, bad, 22 The Nature of Value or indifferent, let us speak instead of its being good, bad, or neither good nor bad that some given state of affairs obtains. Rather than saying that John's being honest is good, that John's being blind is bad, or that John's having brown eyes is neither good nor bad, let us say in\u00ad stead that it is good that John is honest, bad that John is blind, and nei\u00ad ther good nor bad that John has brown eyes. If we do, then rather than saying of a given state of affairs that obtains that it is good, bad, or in\u00ad different, we shall say instead that it is good, bad, or neither good nor bad that some given state of affairs that obtains does in fact obtain. In saying that it is good that John is honest, bad that he is blind, or neither good nor bad that he has brown eyes, we are supposing that he is honest, that he is blind, or that he does have brown eyes. We are sup\u00ad posing, that is, that some given state of affairs does in fact obtain and are saying that it is good, bad, or neither good nor bad that it obtains. Still another alternative to saying that John's being honest is good, John's being blind is bad, and John's having brown eyes is neither good nor bad is to speak as follows: that John is honest is good, that John is blind is bad, and that John has brown eyes is neither good nor bad. To speak in these ways is to suppose that he is honest, that he is blind, or that he does have brown eyes. We are supposing that some given state of affairs does in fact obtain and are saying of it that its obtaining is good, bad, or indifferent. There appears, however, to be no difference in meaning between these two ways of speaking. \"It is good that John is honest\" and \"That John is honest is good\" seem to be identical in meaning. In either case, one is saying of a given state of affairs that obtains that it is good that it obtains.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
