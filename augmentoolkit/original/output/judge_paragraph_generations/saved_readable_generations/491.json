{"paragraph": " EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: EPISTEMIC JUSTIFICATION: EXTERNALISM VS. INTERNALISM; UNPOSSESSED EVIDENCE Andrea and Rich are planning to see a show later tonight. They are currently trying to decide whether they should get on the waitlist at UNPOSSESSED EVIDENCE 145 a particular restaurant because they have been told it\u2019s a fairly long wait. Given the wait time and how long it will take them to finish the meal, they wouldn\u2019t be able to make it to the venue for the show until 8:30pm. They both really want to see the show and would hate to miss any of it. Andrea asks Rich, \u201cDo you think we have enough time to eat here and still make it to the show?\u201d Rich responds, \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. I checked the showtime earlier today, and it doesn\u2019t start until 9pm.\u201d Since they both know that the showtimes at this venue almost never change and dinner wouldn\u2019t interfere with a 9pm start time, they decide to get on the waitlist and enjoy a meal at the restaurant. Later, Andrea and Rich arrive at the venue. They make it at 8:45pm because they decided to have dessert, since they\u2019d still have plenty of time to make it to the show before 9pm. When they arrive, they are informed that they can\u2019t go in because the show is in progress\u2014it started at 7pm! When they complain that the show wasn\u2019t supposed to start until 9pm, they are informed that it had to be moved to 7pm to allow for a different show to run afterward. The person at the ticket booth tells them that they not only posted this change on their web- site, but they also emailed and messaged ticket holders. When Rich looks at his phone, sure enough, there\u2019s both a text and an email from the venue informing him that the show would start at 7pm instead of 9pm. On their way home, Andrea says: Why didn\u2019t you check your phone at the restaurant? You didn\u2019t know they sent emails or messages, but you could have at least checked the website. If you would\u2019ve checked, we wouldn\u2019t have eaten there, and we would have made it to the show.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
