{"paragraph": " INTERNALISM; PROPER FUNCTIONALISM; SWAMPMAN One beautiful spring day, Al is out for a stroll. Thoroughly enjoying himself he continues to walk until he finds himself at the edge of a swamp. It\u2019s early afternoon and a pleasant sunny day, so Al stands by the swamp for a while and enjoys gazing at the trees, watching some birds flying around, and hearing the occasional flop of a fish in the water. While Al is standing there enjoying the scenery, the swamp is struck by a bolt of lightning! Luckily, Al is far enough away to not be injured in any way. \u201cWow!\u201d he thinks, \u201cI\u2019ve always heard of instances where lightning strikes on a clear day, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen it happen.\u201d Not seeing storm clouds or any other signs that there may be more lightning, he decides to continue to enjoy the view. He is so caught up in gazing over the swamp that he doesn\u2019t notice the person who is standing a few feet from him also gazing at the swamp. This person is Sal. Sal is a molecule for molecule duplicate of Al. Somehow Sal was created when the lightning struck the swamp. Since Sal is a molecule for molecule duplicate of Al, he looks like Al, talks like Al, walks like Al, and thinks like Al. In fact, Sal has all of the same beliefs as Al, and he reasons exactly the same way as Al. Right now, Al believes that there is a bird flying not far from where he is be- cause he sees it. Sal also believes that there is a bird flying not far from where he is standing because, like Al, he sees it. Clearly, Al\u2019s belief that there\u2019s a bird flying is warranted. After all, he is a normal adult with SWAMPMAN AND PROPER FUNCTIONALISM 141 good vision looking at a bird that is nearby in good viewing conditions and there\u2019s no strange Gettier-case generating things happening. Proper functionalism agrees with this assessment because Al\u2019s faculty of vision is properly functioning, in this case in an environment (good viewing conditions) for which it was designed.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
