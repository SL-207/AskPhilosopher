{"paragraph": " In each case, Clark and Chalmers try to Otto\u2019s Notebook 165 suggest that these differences are only \u201cshallow\u201d ones: Yes, they are differences, but they are not the kind of differences that make a differ- ence to the causal-explanatory role played by the belief. Another difference that can\u2019t be dismissed so easily concerns belief revision. Normally, when we learn new information, we adjust our other beliefs accordingly, and these adjustments happen automatically. But this doesn\u2019t seem true of the records in Otto\u2019s notebook. It\u2019s a fairly painstaking process to make all of the relevant adjustments each time he learns something new. We might put this point by saying that internal beliefs, unlike the notebook, are informationally integrated (see Weiskopf 2008). A different way to attack Clark and Chalmers\u2019 conclusion has been proposed by Brie Gertler (2007). Though Gertler grants the claim that Otto\u2019s notebook might be seen as playing the same role as stand- ing beliefs, she denies that standing beliefs are part of the mind. On her view, the mind consists only of occurrent states and conscious processes. Fundamental to her conception of mental states is their introspectability. In Gertler\u2019s view, standing states are not introspectable; when we introspect them, they become occurrent. She concludes that standing beliefs are, though internal, not part of the mind\u2014and like- wise for the records in Otto\u2019s notebook.
