{"paragraph": " Thus we sometimes wish that a person who frequently uses such virtues to pursue such ends were not quite as courageous, resolute, and perse\u00ad vering as he proves himself to be. All things considered, it would be better if he did not have these virtues to the degree to which he does, given that he uses them frequently in the pursuit of bad ends. Kant makes essentially the same point in his discussion of the relation of such virtues to the possession of a good or a bad will. 3 At least in part, to have a good will is to be disposed to use various of the virtues in the pursuit of good ends, to have a bad will to be disposed to use them in the pursuit of bad ends. To some it will doubtless be evident that the love of which I have been speaking is kin to if not identical with what is sometimes referred to as Christian love. To some it might seem that such love would be too indis\u00ad criminate. It could, however, be too indiscriminate only if we can some\u00ad times be justified either ( 1 ) in not caring about whether others are good persons or have various goods it would be good that they have or (2) in wanting others not to be good persons or not to have various goods it would be good that they have. It would seem, however, that we can never be justified either in (1) or in (2). We are, however, justified in not wanting others to have certain goods it would not be good that they have because of things thay have done or failed to do, the nature of which is such as to make them deserve not to have certain goods the having of which by them would otherwise be good. Regardless, how\u00ad ever, of how badly anyone has acted and of how bad he has been or is, it would seem that we could never be justified in not wanting him to l l 6 The Nature of Value become and to be a better person than in the past he has been or in the present he is. Thus although loving another is compatible with not wanting him to have certain goods it would be bad that he have because of what he has done or failed to do, it is not compatible with not wanting him to be a good person or at least to become a better person than he has been or is.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
