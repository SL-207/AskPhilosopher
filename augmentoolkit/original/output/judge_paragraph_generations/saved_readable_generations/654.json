{"paragraph": " It might be thought that if something, x, has utility or is useful as a means of producing something else, y, regardless of whether y has any intrinsic value, then y must be something desired or liked by someone, or at least have utility as a means of producing something else, z, which is desired or liked by someone. This, however, would be a mistake. Whether one thing, x, has utility as a means of producing another thing, y, depends entirely upon the relation in which x and y stand to one another, regardless of whether anyone desires or likes y. It is true that I might not regard x as being useful for the production of y if I neither desire nor like y nor regard y as having intrinsic value. From this, how\u00ad ever, it does not follow that in fact x is not useful as a means of pro\u00ad ducing y. Some indication that this is in fact the case is provided by the fact that it sometimes happens that we desire or like something or Species of Value 41 regard it as having intrinsic value, yet do not know what we must do to acquire or produce it and therefore, because of this, endeavor to dis\u00ad cover what we must do. Such a search would seem to rest on the assumption that there are, or at least might be, means or ways of acquiring or producing the thing in question, if only we knew what they are. Another indication that the preceding is in fact the case is provided by the fact that we can be mistaken concerning what is and what is not a means to the acquisition or production of something we desire or like or value. I can believe that x is useful as a means of acquiring or pro\u00ad ducing y when in fact it is not. Whether it is such a means is completely independent both of any beliefs I might have and of my desiring, liking, or valuing y. 3. Instrumental and Contributory Value The species of extrinsic value we have been discussing is instrumental value. Neither that which has instrumental value nor that in relation to which it has such value is such that either is part of the other.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
