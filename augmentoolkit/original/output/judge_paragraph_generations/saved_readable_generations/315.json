{"paragraph": " Though the narrative may fall short of perfect con- sistency, the very process of bringing disparate events together serves to impose a degree of coherence and intelligibility on them. In con- stituting one\u2019s self in line with a first-person narrative, an individual comes to understand and interpret their life\u2019s experiences against the background of an overall story that serves to imbue those experiences with overall significance. The process of developing such stories varies from individual to individual along many different dimensions\u2014e.g., how explicit they are, how detailed they are, how aspirational they are, and so on. Moreover, narratives will differ in terms of which prop- erties and factors play an organizing role. In some cases it might be gender and race. In some cases it might be political affiliation or ca- reer. And in some cases\u2014as with Barbara Adams\u2014it may have to do with hobbies. Self-narrative theories differ in terms of how they treat outside in- fluences on a person\u2019s self-narrative\u2014that is, how much other people\u2019s narratives about an individual can impact or override that individual\u2019s self-narrative. While some argue strongly that other people\u2019s stories cannot override an individual\u2019s own story about herself (DeGrazia 2005, p. 87), others allow for more impact and influence (Lindemann 2001, Plantikow 2008). How self-narrative theorists come down on this issue will also affect their assessment of cases like Avery. To deal with cases like this, where an individual seems to be in some sense \u00addeluded, some self-narrative theorists incorporate constraints on an individual\u2019s narrative about themself. For example, one might impose a reality constraint according to which narratives must cohere with \u00adreality in fundamental ways, even if it contains minor inaccuracies along the way (Schechtman 1996, p. 119). Unfortunately, it\u2019s left fairly vague how to determine what counts as fundamental coherence with The Trekkie, Mr.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
