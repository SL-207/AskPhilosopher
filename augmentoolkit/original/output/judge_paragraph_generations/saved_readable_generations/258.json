{"paragraph": " The sun is staying in one place and the Earth is turning. It would be silly and pedantic to correct everyone who talked about the sunrise. Still, if you want to know what is really going on you have to recognize that, though that statement is conventionally true, it is ultimately false. Similarly, \u201cthe self exists\u201d is conventionally true, but ultimately false. Really, ultimately, the self doesn\u2019t exist, and neither does the chariot (Siderits 2021). There are some worries about this way of putting things. In some sense, all language is conventional: our word \u201ctree\u201d refers to trees not by some magic nature of the look or sound of the word, but because we have decided to use it that way. Given this, all statements are in some sense conventionally true\u2014including statements the Buddhists say are ultimately true. It might be more helpful to move away from the linguistic explanation and argue that some ways of conceptualizing the world are merely helpful for humans but other ways carve nature at its joints, getting at the real, mind-independent essence of things (Quine 1969). Whether or not something is or isn\u2019t a sundial, for ex- ample, is probably not a deep fact about the world\u2014many things can be used to tell time using shadows cast by the sun. Is a mountain peak in a clearing a sundial? It probably depends more on what we decide to say than about the way the world really is in a mind-independent sense. That might not be true of electrons or more fundamental items. Electrons are not merely groupings of items for practical purpose. They exist independent of convention, and if we didn\u2019t think of the world in terms of electrons, we would be missing something about the constitution of the world. We can perhaps say that things like sun- dials are conventional kinds and things like electrons are natural kinds. Perhaps the right thing to say, then, is that selves and chariots are like sundials: it\u2019s helpful to conceptualize things in this way\u2014to think of The Chariot and the Candle 251 the world as containing those items\u2014but doing so doesn\u2019t get at the basic nature of things.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
