{"paragraph": " Some respond to positions like the justificationist view and the total evidence view by arguing that merely having a very high degree of justification for the disagreed upon proposition doesn\u2019t make it justi- fied for Asa to think that Pedro is more likely to be wrong in this case. One of the key ways of arguing for this position is to appeal to the following sort of situation (Christensen 2007). Your friend has pur- chased a lottery ticket in an extremely large, but fair, lottery. You have very good justification for thinking that your friend\u2019s ticket lost the \u00adlottery\u2014the odds against winning are incredibly low. However, you add up the numbers (we assume that the lottery is won by adding up one\u2019s numbers and the total matching the winning number) and realize that her ticket\u2019s number doesn\u2019t match. Now, imagine that your friend adds up the numbers and says they match. In this case, opponents of the justificationist view claim that although you have a very high degree of justification for believing that your friend\u2019s number doesn\u2019t match the winning number, this doesn\u2019t give you sufficiently good reason to think that it is she who has made the mistake in adding the numbers. There are many additional moves in the debates concerning the various positions about how we should respond to disagreement with epistemic peers; far too many to discuss here. It is, however, worth keeping in mind one thing about these debates. The reason that they are taken to be significant is that if we are honest with ourselves, we will recognize that we disagree with people who are our epistemic peers when it comes to many of the things that are most important to us: religion, politics, philosophy, and so on. As a result, what we are justified in doing in the face of disagreement impacts the rationality of many of our most cherished beliefs. RECOMMENDED READING GENERAL OVERVIEWS Disagreement.
