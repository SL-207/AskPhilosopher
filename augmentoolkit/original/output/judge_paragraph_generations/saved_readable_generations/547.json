{"paragraph": " And, as we\u2019ve seen, many of these thought experiments are designed to be counterexamples to particular theories or claims. Even those that aren\u2019t specifically designed to be counterexamples are intended to motivate a particular argument or claim. The puzzles and para- doxes presented in the remaining entries are different. Rather than imaginative thought experiments, these entries include more abstract presentations of features that generate puzzles or paradoxes. When it comes to the entries in this section, they differ from the earlier entries because they typically aren\u2019t presented with the aim of motivating a particular epistemological view. Instead, they are genuinely raising puzzles and paradoxes to be solved. Before moving on, it\u2019s worth taking a brief moment to explain the general structure of puzzles and paradoxes. The two are similar in some ways (that\u2019s why they\u2019re in the same section of the book!), but they are also importantly different. Puzzles and paradoxes are similar to one another, in that they both present us with problems that don\u2019t have obvious solutions. And, in many cases, it is really difficult to Puzzles and Paradoxes 206 figure out what the correct solutions to these puzzles and paradoxes are. Despite their similarities, puzzles and paradoxes are different in at least one very important way. A puzzle can arise when we find our- selves facing an unexpected result or a challenge to something that we take for granted (this is why, for example, the challenge of external world skepticism is sometimes referred to as a puzzle). However, a paradox requires more than this. Typically, a paradox will only arise when we realize that two or more things that each seem clearly true are inconsistent with one another. As we will see, in many cases each response to a given paradox involves giving up on or drastically revis- ing a seemingly obvious truth. 41 A GRUESOME RIDDLE (NEW RIDDLE OF INDUCTION/GRUE) Background: In order to appreciate this puzzle it is helpful to remind our- selves of the nature of inductive inference.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
