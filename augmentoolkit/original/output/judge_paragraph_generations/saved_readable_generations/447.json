{"paragraph": " In other words, when p is the best explanation of the facts among all of the rival explanations, it is reasonable to believe that p is true. Of course, for this to make sense we have to recognize that \u201cexplanation\u201d in the sense LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 100 that matters for IBE refers to \u201cpotential explanation\u201d (something that, if true, would explain the relevant facts). After all, in order for there to be rival explanations (explanations that are contrary to each other in the sense that at most one of them is true), it has to be that these rival explanations are potential explanations because at most one of these explanations is a genuine explanation if we are referring to the actual (i.e. true) explanation of the facts. Consequently, IBE is the idea that we should accept that the best potential explanation of a relevant set of facts is the actual explanation of those facts. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: INFERENCE TO THE BEST EXPLANATION; DISJUNCTION OBJECTION Bas is at the Kentucky Derby. He\u2019s considering whether or not to place a bet on the big race. He starts thinking through his options. Of the 20 horses in the race, Lucky III is favored to win. He\u2019s from cham- pion stock; the previous two Lucky\u2019s both won major races and Lucky III looks every bit as strong and as fast as them. However, Bas realizes that the other 19 horses are all top thoroughbreds as well. While he\u2019s trying to decide what to do, he goes to have a snack. Absorbed in his deliberations, Bas doesn\u2019t realize that the race has begun. In fact, Bas isn\u2019t even watching when he hears a loud cheer as the race ends! When Bas hears the crowd cheering, he realizes that the race is over, but he didn\u2019t place his bet or even see who won. The announcer hasn\u2019t declared the winner yet either. Now we come to the relevant question: what should Bas think about the outcome of the race? Particularly, should Bas think that Lucky III won?", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
