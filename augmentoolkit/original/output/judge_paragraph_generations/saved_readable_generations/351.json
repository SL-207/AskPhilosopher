{"paragraph": " You are willing to use the proposition that the Earth is spherical in your reasoning, e.g. you reason that since the Earth is spherical, if someone were able to start walking in a straight line and do so long enough, she would end up where she started. So, the best explanation for why you might assert something like \u201cI don\u2019t believe the Earth is spherical, I know it is!\u201d is that you want to emphasize that this is not something that you merely believe. You are making it clear that this is something that you believe for good reasons, i.e. you have strong justification for accepting that the Earth is spherical. To make the general point clearer, think about your acquaintance Fred again, who not only doesn\u2019t believe the Earth is spherical, he actually be- lieves that it is flat. Would we say that Fred knows that the Earth isn\u2019t flat? It seems not. Rather, it seems that we might say that he should know that the Earth isn\u2019t flat. Even if Fred is aware of all sorts of evi- dence for thinking that the Earth is spherical, it doesn\u2019t seem that he knows it isn\u2019t flat since he doesn\u2019t believe this. Hence, the traditional account of knowledge holds that belief is necessary for knowledge. Truth. As with belief, there may be a temptation to think that knowledge doesn\u2019t really require truth. For example, when your team loses a big game that you thought you were going to win, you might say something like: \u201cI just knew we were going to win.\u201d Superficially, NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 4 it seems that you are saying that you have knowledge of something false\u2014you had knowledge that the team would win, but it\u2019s false that the team would win. Is this the best way to understand what you are saying here though? It doesn\u2019t seem so. A much better explanation is that what you are really expressing is the fact that you were confident that the team would win or that you thought you knew that the team would win.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
