{"paragraph": " It is because pieces are themselves particulars and therefore would still exist as particulars if they were separated from the wholes of which they are pieces that Husserl regards therri as independent parts of the wholes of which they are parts. And it is because moments can exist only as aspects or qualities of particulars that Husserl regards them as being dependent parts of the particulars of which they are parts. 2 The preceding distinctions can be illustrated by means of a simple example. Suppose that a certain table exists and that it has a top and four legs. Suppose also that the color of the exterior surface of the top and of each of the four legs is a uniform shade of brown. The top and each of the four legs are independent parts or pieces of the table, since each would still exist as a particular, although no longer as a part of the table, if it were separated from the other pieces of the table. The brown color of the table and of each of its pieces, however, is a dependent part of the table and of each of its pieces. It is a moment, aspect, or quality of the table and of each of its pieces, and as such it is not a piece of the table or of any of its pieces. It can exist only as a moment, aspect, or quality of the table and of each of its pieces and therefore is not itself a particular. The parts of a whole, whether they be pieces or moments of the whole, can contribute to the value of the whole. Both the top and each of the legs of the table of our example, let us suppose, contributes to the value of the table, and as doing so each has contributory value. The color of the table might also contribute to the value of the table, and if it does it too has contributory value. The degree to which each of its pieces and its color contributes to the value of the table is the degree to which each has contributory value relative to the table. The contribu\u00ad tory value of each of its parts is positive if each contributes to making the table a good table, and the degree to which each has positive con\u00ad tributory value is the degree to which each contributes to making the table a good table.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
