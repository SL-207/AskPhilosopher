{"paragraph": " The idea is that whether or not someone has a belief is context sensitive. The thrust of this response is that in gen- eral, whether someone counts as believing something depends upon Preface Paradox 247 the particular context that the person is in. So, one might believe that p relative to one context but not relative to another. Consequently, this sort of response claims that Sharon counts as believing the claims of her book when she was writing the main part of her book, but not when she is writing the preface, and vice versa for the claim in the preface that she has made a mistake in the main part of the book. Thus, although Sharon has the justified beliefs that seem to generate the paradox, she doesn\u2019t actually have inconsistent beliefs because she doesn\u2019t count as believing each of these in the same context.
