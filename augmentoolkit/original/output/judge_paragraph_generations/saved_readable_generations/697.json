{"paragraph": " If this is correct, then although in any situation in which we can act wrongly we can also act rightly, there are also situations in which we can act rightly, in the sense of not acting wrongly, even though in such situations we cannot act wrongly. If we had no duties we could not act wrongly and could act rightly only in the sense that, given that we have no duties, we could not fail to fulfill them. Since the concepts of rightness and wrongness are definable in terms of the concept of duty, the latter concept is more fundamental. The concept of supererogation is also definable in terms of the con\u00ad cept_ of duty, and indeed is usually so defined, as when it is said that supererogatory acts are those acts that are above and beyond the call of duty. Although all such acts are right, in the sense that their perfor- Moral and Non-Moral Value 75 mance does not violate duties, none are duties. From this, however, it does not follow, as it seems sometimes to be thought, that supereroga\u00ad tory acts have greater moral value and are harder to perform than acts that are simply duties but not supererogatory. Thus suppose that as I walk along a certain street I see a beggar and that I give him a dollar even though I have no duty to give him any money at all. Suppose also that this act requires no sacrifice of any significance on my part, that I find the performance of it easy, and that it has some moral value. There is no difficulty, however, in conceiving of many duties the performance of which would require some sacrifice on my part, that I might find it hard to fulfill, and the fulfillment of which would have considerably greater moral value than the performance of the simple supererogatory act of giving a dollar to a beggar. To say, then, that an act is supereroga\u00ad tory is to say only that, although it is right, it is above and beyond the call of duty but not necessarily that its performance is harder than, requires greater sacrifice than, and has greater moral value than the ful\u00ad fillment of certain duties.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
