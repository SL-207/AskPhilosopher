{"paragraph": " More\u00ad over, even when each part of a whole\u00b7 does have some intrinsic value, whether positive or negative, the intrinsic value of the whole, whether positive or negative, can be greater than the combined intrinsic value of the collection of its parts when the latter are considered in abstraction from one another and the whole of which they are the parts. This is in accordance with Moore's principle of organic wholes. This principle applies to instrumental value as well as to intrinsic value. The instru\u00ad mental value of a whole can be greater than the combined instrumental value of the collection of its parts when the latter are considered in abstraction from one another and the whole of which they are parts. Thus our table can have greater instrumental value than its top and legs would have collectively if they were separated from one another and thereby from the table. Any part of any given whole can also be regarded as a part of some other whole. This has already been illustrated in the examples given above. Thus Abraham's causing his parents to suffer is a part not only of the whole consisting of itself and of Abraham's being pleased that he has caused his parents to suffer but also of the whole consisting of itself and of Isaac's being pleased that Abraham has caused his parents to suffer. Indeed, any state of affairs, regardless of whether it obtains, can be regarded as a part of some whole consisting of itself and of some other state of affairs, regardless of what the latter state of affairs might be and of whether it obtains. Thus the state of affairs consisting of my now being sorry that it is raining in Miami, which is a state of affairs that does not obtain, may be regarded as a part of a whole consisting of itself and of the state of affairs consisting of some Mongolian's now being pleased that the sun is shining in Ulan Bator, which might or might not obtain.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
