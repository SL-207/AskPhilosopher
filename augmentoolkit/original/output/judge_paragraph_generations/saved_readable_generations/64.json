DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-13 THE SLUGS AND THE TILES BACKGROUND According to the knowledge and conceivability arguments, there is an epistemic gap (a gap in knowledge) between the physical and the phenomenal; and the epistemic gap entails a metaphysical gap (a gap in the world) that physicalists cannot abide. In the case of the knowl- edge argument, the epistemic gap is expressed in terms of the case of Mary in the black-and-white room (see Chapter 6). Here, the claim is that there are phenomenal truths about color experiences that Mary cannot deduce from the complete physical truth. In the case of the conceivability argument, the epistemic gap is often expressed in terms of the conceivability of a zombie world\u2014that is, a consciousness-free world that is a physical/functional duplicate of the actual world.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
