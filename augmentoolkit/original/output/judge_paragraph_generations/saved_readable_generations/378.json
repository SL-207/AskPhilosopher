{"paragraph": " Unbeknownst to Jon, the library he visits is actually pretty horrible\u2014it is full of books that are grossly inaccurate. There are many books about Alexander the Great in the library, but almost all of them are terribly unreliable. As luck NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 30 would have it, Jon happens to randomly pick the one accurate book about Alexander the Great in the library. Jon reads the book and learns about Alexander\u2019s battle tactics, his tendency to grant a considerable amount of autonomy to the people he conquered, and so on. As a result of what Jon learns from the book, Jon is able to explain why Alexander was so successful in battle and how he was able to conquer so many places. If asked questions about Alexander or his victories in battle or his campaigns, Jon is able to readily give thoughtful and cor- rect answers. Jon grasps how various features of Alexander\u2019s military strength along with his diplomatic strategies allowed him to maintain control of a vast region of the world. In fact, Jon is able to write essays on the topic that would convince accomplished historians that he has a firm understanding of Alexander and his successes. Given Jon\u2019s grasp of various facts about Alexander and his ability to explain Alexander\u2019s successes, it seems that Jon understands why Al- exander was successful. Nevertheless, it also seems that Jon doesn\u2019t know why Alexander was successful. Why not? The reason is that Jon is unknowingly in a fake barn-style Gettier case (see A Strange County pp. 16\u201320). The presence of all of the unreliable books that Jon could have easily consulted makes it so that Jon\u2019s justified true beliefs about Alexander are lucky in a way that seems incompatible with knowledge. Jon\u2019s coming to have justified true beliefs about Alexander is directly analogous to Martha\u2019s having a justified true belief that she is looking at a barn when she is surrounded by nu- merous barn fa\u00e7ades.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
