Oxford: Oxford University Press. 4 RED BARNS AND BLUE FA\u00c7ADES (KRIPKE\u2019S BARN) Background: One sort of modal response to the Gettier Problem (in both its original form and the fake barn version) that initially seemed promising (and still has defenders) appeals to sensitivity. When Robert Nozick first developed his theory of knowledge, he provided motivations for a sensitivity requirement on knowledge that were independent of the Gettier Problem. This sort of independent motivation made (makes) adding a sensitivity requirement an appealing response to the Gettier Problem. Recall from the previous two entries that S\u2019s belief that p counts as sensitive just in case it is true that if p were false, S wouldn\u2019t believe that p. In the original Gettier cases (see Promotions and Traveling Friends pp. 6\u201311), Smith\u2019s belief that the person who got the promotion owns an Armani jacket and his belief concerning Jones owning a Ferrari or Brown being in Barcelona both fail to meet the sensitivity requirement. Since both beliefs rely upon other justified, but false, beliefs of Smith\u2019s, he would continue to believe that the person who got the promotion owns an Armani jacket and Jones owns a Ferrari or Brown is in Barcelona even if these beliefs were false.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
