{"paragraph": "\u201d The sensitivity response to the Gettier Problem says that Martha\u2019s justified true belief that \u201cthat is a barn\u201d fails to count as knowledge. Why? The reason is that this belief isn\u2019t sensitive to the truth of there actually being a barn present. After all, if Martha\u2019s belief were false (i.e. if she weren\u2019t actually seeing a barn), she would still believe it because she would be fooled by one of the barn fa\u00e7ades. And Martha would still believe of the fake barn that it is a real barn. So, the sensitivity response yields the correct result that Martha doesn\u2019t know that the object she\u2019s looking at is a barn. But what about her more specific be- lief that \u201cthat is a red barn\u201d? Here is where things get problematic for the sensitivity response. This belief seems to be sensitive. If it were false that \u201cthat is a red barn\u201d, Martha wouldn\u2019t believe \u201cthat is a red barn\u201d. Why not? Because all of the fake barns are blue. So, in cases where the object before Martha is not a red barn, it is because the object is a blue barn fa\u00e7ade. In such cases, Martha wouldn\u2019t believe that it is a red KRIPKE\u2019S BARN 23 barn; rather Martha would mistakenly believe that the object is a blue barn. As a result, Martha\u2019s belief that \u201cthat is a red barn\u201d is sensitive to the truth of the object being a red barn. This means the sensitivity response yields a very counterintuitive result: Martha knows that the object is a red barn, but she doesn\u2019t know that it is a barn! It strikes many epistemologists that this case succeeds as a counter- example to the idea that there is a sensitivity condition on knowledge. That is to say, they find it absurd to think that Martha can know that she\u2019s looking at a red barn but at the same time fail to know that she is looking at a barn. Consequently, many epistemologists take this sort of example to be a decisive reason to deny that the sensitivity response is successful and to deny that a sensitivity condition should be added to the traditional account of knowledge.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
