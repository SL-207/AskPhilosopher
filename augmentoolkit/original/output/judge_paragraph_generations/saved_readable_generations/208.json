{"paragraph": " The cases we con- sider in this chapter challenge the theory of seemings, and thereby also challenge the common factor view. THE CASE Suppose there is a series of 100 color swatches, S1 to S100, ranging from blue to green (Putnam 1999). The transition between swatches is very gradual\u2014so much so that any two consecutive swatches seem indistinguishable to you. We can imagine the following case. If you look at S1 and S2 together, they appear indistinguishable, and the same is true for S2 and S3. But if you look at S1 and S3 side by side, they seem different. Though this is a common enough case, it poses a problem for the theory of seemings. According to that the- ory, when you look at S1, S2, and S3 you have seemings S*1, S*2, and S*3. Since in this case seemings are how the swatches seem, and S*1 and S*2 are indistinguishable, S*1 and S*2 are qualitatively identical. So then are S*2 and S*3. But there is a problem: S*1 and S*3 are distinguishable, so they are not qualitatively identical. But if S*1 is qualitatively identical to S*2 and S*2 is qualitatively identical to S*3, then, by the transitivity of identity, S*1 must be qualita- tively identical to S*3. But, since you can distinguish between them, they aren\u2019t qualitatively identical. So we have a contradiction: S*1 is qualitatively identical to S*3 by the transitivity of identity, but, since they are distinguishable, they are not qualitatively identical. The theory of seemings therefore must be wrong: there cannot be internal states defined by how things seem. This suggests that the view that there is an internal common factor between perceptions and misperceptions\u2014a common factor that explains how things seem\u2014is incorrect. PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 202 DISCUSSION One concern about the swatches argument is that it seems to assume that a swatch seems the same across contexts. But the defender of seemings will probably deny this (Jackson and Pinkerton 1973).", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
