{"paragraph": " Once Laurie has an appropriately fine-grained representation of the outcomes, this response contends that standard decision theory will work just fine. Another response to this challenge is to argue that standard decision theory has the resources to respond to this sort of challenge because it could appeal to a \u201cmaster utility function\u201d (Chang 2015). Essentially, the idea here is that rather than going off of what your actual values are for any particular outcomes, the way to make decisions is to decide based on the values your ideal self (the version of you that has all the relevant information and is perfectly rational) would have. So, Laurie\u2019s decision is rational when it corresponds to what her ideal self would choose. Of course, we might worry how in the world Laurie is sup- posed to know what her ideal self would choose though. Yet another way to respond is to insist that Laurie actually can come to have evidence about what it\u2019s like to be a parent before be- coming one herself (Harman 2015). While she cannot know this in the sense of actually having the experience (since she hasn\u2019t had it yet), she can reasonably estimate the value to her of becoming a parent by learning from the testimony of others, observing how people who are parents seem when it comes to their satisfaction with being parents, and inferring how she would value this change based on how similar sorts of experiences have been for her. A final sort of response appeals to the reasonableness of trust (Com- paijen 2018). The idea here is that in a situation like Laurie\u2019s, it can be reasonable for her to trust that her current desires will be fulfilled when making this sort of transformative choice. And, so the response goes, since it is reasonable for her to trust this, she can make a reasonable de- cision in this sort of situation by deciding based on her current values.
