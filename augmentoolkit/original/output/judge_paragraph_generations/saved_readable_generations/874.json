It might be thought that although it is ( 1 ) appropriate to like something good and to dislike something bad and (2) inappropriate to like something bad and to dislike something good, it is (a) not necessarily good to like something good or to dislike something bad and ( b) not necessarily bad to like something bad and to dislike something good. Such a view, however, would seem to neglect the fact that appropriate likings and dislikings are good and inappro\u00ad priate ones bad and that it is good to like or dislike appropriately and bad to like or dislike inappropriately. 2. Sometimes an object is liked or disliked far more than it merits because it is believed to be far better or far worse than in fact it is. Such excessive likings and dislikings are proportioned, or at least might be, to the degree of goodness or badness the object is believed to have, and in that respect might be said to be appropriate or fitting relative to the beliefs in question. Given, however, that the latter are mistaken, such excessive likings and dislikings are intrinsically bad, since they are far out of proportion to the degree of goodness and badness the 214 Notes to Chapters 9-1 0 objects liked or disliked do in fact possess, and the beliefs in question are at least extrinsically bad as occasioning the intrinsically bad likings and disliking. 3. If, however, the argument of section 1 in chapter 4 is sound, this cannot be all that is meant by saying of something that it is intrinsically good or intrin\u00ad sically bad. Chapter 10 1.
