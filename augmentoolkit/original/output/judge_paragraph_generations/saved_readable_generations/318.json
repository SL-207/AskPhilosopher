DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-56 THE PUZZLE OF TRANSFORMATIVE CHOICE BACKGROUND When we make decisions about our futures, whether routine deci- sions about what to have for dinner or more monumental decisions about what career path to pursue, our decisions are guided by our be- liefs and desires. Normative decision theory proposes a framework for judging the rationality of an agent\u2019s decisions in light of these beliefs and desires\u2014that is, in telling us what choice an agent should make given the beliefs and desires that they have. Since there are various elements of uncertainty in most cases of decision-making\u2014e.g., we might not be sure whether the vegetables in the fridge are still fresh or whether there will still be a demand for accountants in 10 years\u2019 time\u2014decision theory aims to provide an adequate model for how to deal with this uncertainty. Although different theories spell out the details in varying ways, generally speaking the model will involve the notion of expected value. An agent choosing between Option A and Option B makes a calculation about what value A is expected to have, a calculation about what value B is expected to have, and compares the two. The rational decision will favor the option with the higher expected value.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
