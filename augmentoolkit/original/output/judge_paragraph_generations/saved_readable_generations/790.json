{"paragraph": " Practical rationality sometimes consists in our doing this only because we are sometimes more likely to satisfy certain of our non\u00ad theoretical desires if we do than if we do not. Conflicts between practical and theoretical reason can occur only because we sometimes desire as an end something other than the acqui\u00ad sition of knowledge. As was indicated above, if the end of each were identical with that of the other, no such conflicts could occur. But the end of each is not identical with that of the other, and sometimes con\u00ad flicts do occur. When they do, sometimes an increase in knowledge has greater value than, and therefore takes precedence over, the attainment of whatever else it is that such an increase conflicts with, and sometimes the reverse is the case. Sometimes it is very hard indeed, and sometimes impossible, to decide in particular cases of conflict which of the con\u00ad flicting claims-that of practical or that of theoretical reason-takes The Primacy of Practical Rationality 14 7 precedence over the other. Nonethekss, practical wisdom consists in part in the ability to determine in particular cases which of the con\u00ad flicting claims takes precedence over the other. Such wisdom is practical rather than theoretical because the determination of which of the con\u00ad flicting claims takes precedence over the other can be made correctly only by considering carefully the degree of value that would probably be realized, and the degree that would probably be lost, by choosing one of the competing alternatives rather than the other. Since, that is, an increase in knowledge, although often a value, is not the only value, and since reason functions practically rather than theoretically when we endeavor to determine which among competing values has greater value, it is the function of practical rather than theoretical reason to determine in particular cases whether some increase in knowledge would have greater value than the attainment of something else would have when the two cannot both be had.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
