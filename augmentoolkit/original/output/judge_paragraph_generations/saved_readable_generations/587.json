{"paragraph": " Another response is to deny CONJUNCTION. The idea here is that although Sharon justifiedly believes each of the claims in her book, she isn\u2019t justified in believing the conjunction of all of those claims. The thought here is that if she isn\u2019t justified in believing the conjunction, then her justified belief that the conjunction is false (that she has made some mistake somewhere in the book) doesn\u2019t contra- dict her other beliefs. Two other kinds of responses remain\u2014accept that Sharon has the beliefs mentioned in the case but deny that Sharon\u2019s beliefs are actu- ally inconsistent in this case or deny that Sharon even has the justified beliefs that the Preface Paradox assumes that she does. Let\u2019s start with the latter. Some argue that Sharon doesn\u2019t have the justified beliefs that we have been assuming because she\u2019s not actually justified in be- lieving that there is an error in her book (Ryan 1991, 1996). Instead, this response insists that at most Sharon is justified in believing some- thing like the book might contain an error or that it probably contains an error. Hence, even if Sharon believes that her book contains an error, that belief isn\u2019t justified. Another way of cashing out this re- sponse is to contend that Sharon doesn\u2019t even have the beliefs that it appears that she does (Kim 2015). This response contends that saying the sort of thing that Sharon does in the preface of her book signals her acknowledgment of her own fallibility without implying that she actually believes that there is an error in her book. Of course, if Sharon doesn\u2019t actually have the beliefs that are claimed to be inconsistent, then there is no paradox here. The final sort of response allows that Sharon has the justified beliefs that seem to generate the paradox but argues that those beliefs aren\u2019t inconsistent (Clarke 2017). One way to do this is to maintain that while Sharon believes the conjunction of the claims of her book and believes what she expressed in the preface, she doesn\u2019t have those be- liefs in the same context.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
