JUSTIFICATION 136 RESPONSES Although this case is importantly different from a case of forgotten evidence (see Avocados Are Healthy, But I Forgot Why pp. 129\u2013133), the two are similar in that they arise from the consideration of the role that memory plays in justification. In light of their similarities, it is not surprising that some of the responses that are used to respond to the problem of forgotten evidence are often appealed to as a way to handle this sort of case as well. For example, some respond to this sort of case by insisting that it\u2019s not one\u2019s present evidence that matters for determining justification, instead what matters is the evidence that one had when originally forming a belief (Huemer 1999). If the belief is justified when initially formed, then it will be justified later (assum- ing that one hasn\u2019t gained new evidence that undermines the belief). So, on this response one might claim that the reason Kai knows (and so, has a justified belief) now is that he had good evidence for believ- ing L when he formed the belief and he obviously hasn\u2019t gained any defeating evidence while in a dreamless sleep. Another response to forgotten evidence that may be appealed to here is that of coherentism (Poston 2014). Recall that coherentism is the view that a particular belief is justified just in case it coheres suffi- ciently well with one\u2019s other beliefs. A coherentist might say that Kai\u2019s belief that L is justified when he forms it because the belief coheres suf- ficiently well with his other beliefs. Additionally, the coherentist could insist that while Kai dreamlessly sleeps, the coherence among his be- liefs isn\u2019t affected, i.e. they cohere just as well as they did when he was awake. Hence, the coherentist may be able to respond by claiming that Kai\u2019s belief remains justified while he sleeps because of its coherence.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
