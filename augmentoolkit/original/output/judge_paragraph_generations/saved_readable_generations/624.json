{"paragraph": " To generalize, any sentence used to state a true proposition also states a fact and vice versa. Thus \"The Eiffel Tower is in Paris\" states a true proposition if and only if it states a fact. This last, however, can be misleading in that it might suggest that the stated true proposition and the stated fact are distinct, when in point of fact they are identical. The true proposition stated by the true sentence \"p,\" rather than being distinct from the fact stated by \"p,\" is instead identical with this fact. Thus to admit the category of facts in this third sense is not to introduce a category distinct from and in addi\u00ad tion to that of true propositions. Instead, the term \"fact,\" used in this third sense, is only another name for what is designated by the expres\u00ad sion \"true proposition\". There is still another sense of \"fact\" that perhaps should be men\u00ad tioned. This is the sense in which the term is used to designate anything that exists or has being independently of its being thought of by anyone. The term is used in this sense more widely in non-philosophical than in philosophical contexts and discourse. Facts in this sense of the term may be referred to as \"existent entities\" or \"real entities\". In this sense of \"fact\" the Eiffel Tower, since it exists independently of being thought of by anyone, is a fact, whereas mermaids and square-circles, since they do not, are not facts. Although acts of thinking of mermaids or square\u00ad circles, since they can occur without themselves being thought of, are facts, the intended objects of such acts are not, since they have no being independently of being for someone intentional objects. If anything does in fact exist independently of its being for anyone an intentional object, then there are facts in the sense in question. In this sense of the term\u043e however, facts are objects rather than objectives. The result of these considerations is that the category of facts is not an irreducible ontological category.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
