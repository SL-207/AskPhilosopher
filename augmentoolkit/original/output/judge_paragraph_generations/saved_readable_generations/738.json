{"paragraph": " There is another side, which is that such attempts manifest a certain contempt for the virtues one pretends to have. Even if it be true that I necessarily pay homage to a given virtue if I endeavor to deceive myself into believing that I have it, and even though it might also be true that I might also pay homage to a given virtue if I attempt to deceive others into believing that I have it, I do not in doing so pay as much homage to the virtue in question as I should do were I to endeavor to acquire it rather than to deceive myself or others into believing that I already have it. I can honor fully a given virtue, as distinguished from pretending that I already have it, only if I endeavor to acquire it, and this I can do only if I er:ideavor to do the sorts of things I must do if I am in fact to have it. To attempt to deceive myself or others into believing that I have a given virtue does mean, for reasons already given, that I pay a kind of homage Persons, Things, and Value 107 to it. At least I honor it more than I should if I did not care in the least whether I have it and therefore made no attempt whatever to deceive myself or others into believing that I have it ( except as a means of escaping unpleasant consequences that might occur if others believe that I do not have it). People who do not care in the least whether they have any of the virtues do not even do the virtues the honor of pre\u00ad tending to have them, except perhaps as a means to something else. To attempt, however, to deceive myself or others into believing that I have certain virtues that I do not in fact have is not only to pay a certain homage to them but is also to hold them in a certain contempt. I honor them in pretending to have them but also dishonor them in not endeav\u00ad oring to acquire them. I honor them in wanting to seem to myself or others to have them but dishonor them in not wanting actually to have them.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
