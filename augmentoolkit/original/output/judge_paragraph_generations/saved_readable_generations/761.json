{"paragraph": " Ought those who know of his philandering to enlighten his wife and children? By doing so we reveal to them certain truths of some importance. Even if their coming to know such truths has a certain intrinsic value, the consequences of their coming to know them would The Primacy of Practical Rationality 125 have a negative intrinsic value incalculably greater than any positive intrinsic value their coming to know them could have. Confronted with such a situation, it is unlikely that many of even the most zealous par\u00ad tisans of the primacy of theoretical reason would advise that our phi\u00ad landerer's wife and children be enlightened. Despite their philosophical espousal of the primacy of theoretical reason, it is unlikely that many among them would practice what they preach when confronted with concrete existential situations of the sort in question. In such situations their hearts would overrule, and rightly so, the dictates of their heads, and their practice would manifest a practical wisdom far greater than any theoretical wisdom their abstract philosophical pronouncements might possess. In the example above we considered only the value, or the lack thereof, of the enlightenment by others of the philanderer's wife and children. Similar considerations apply to attempts at self-enlightenment on the part of the wife or children. Suppose that the wife suspects her husband of philandering but neither believes nor knows that he is doing so. In such a situation she might or might not want to know the truth. If she does not_ want to know, the reason she does not might well be that she fears the consequences that might ensue were she to come to know. She might, however, want to know the truth even though she fears these consequences. Let us suppose that the consequences of her coming to know would be those indicated above and that it is these she fears. Suppose also, as before, that the negative intrinsic value of these consequences would be inestimably greater than the positive intrinsic value of her coming to know.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
