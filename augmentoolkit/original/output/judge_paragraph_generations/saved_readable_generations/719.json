{"paragraph": " If so, then two distinct exemplifications of the same universal are such that one is good and the other bad, depending upon the nature or the kind of the partic\u00ad ular exemplifying it. Sweet ice cream is good, sweet beer bad. Suppose now that there are two dishes of ice cream, one of which is sweet, the other bitter. Because of this, the first is good, the second bad. If so, then the exemplification of different universals by two distinct particulars of the same kind is such that the exemplification of one is good, of the other bad, depending upon the nature of the universals exemplified. One is such that its exemplification by ice cream is good, the other such that its exemplification by ice cream is bad. Sweet ice cream is good, bitter ice cream bad. Suppose next that we are told that two particulars are such that one is sweet, the other bitter, and that we know nothing else about them. If so, we do not have sufficient information to deter\u00ad mine whether either particular is good, bad, or indifferent. Suppose, finally, that we are told either ( 1) that two particulars of a given kind are such that one exemplifies some universal the other does not or (2) that two particulars of different kinds exemplify the same universal, and that in each case we have no knowledge of which universals are exem\u00ad plified. If so, then we do not have sufficient information to enable us to determine whether the particulars in question are good, bad, or indif\u00ad ferent. To know whether the exemplification of any given universal by any given particular is good, bad, or indifferent we need to know both which universal is exemplified and the nature or the kind of the partic\u00ad ular exemplifying it. The fact that the exemplification of the same universal by two partic\u00ad ulars that differ in kind is such that its exemplification by a particular of one kind can be good and its exemplification by a particular of the other Persons, Things, and Value 93 kind can be bad supports the view that universals themselves can be nei\u00ad ther good nor bad when taken in abstraction from any consideration either of whether they are exemplified or, if they are exemplified, of what kinds of particulars exemplify them.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
