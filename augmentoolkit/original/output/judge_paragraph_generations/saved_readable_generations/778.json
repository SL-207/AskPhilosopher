{"paragraph": " On such a view of deception, in order that I attempt to deceive, and there\u00ad fore in order that my attempt succeed, I must intend to deceive, and in order that I intend to deceive I must know or be conscious of my inten\u00ad tion to deceive. I cannot, that is, attempt to deceive unless I know or am conscious that I am attempting to do so. But although I can succeed in deceiving another even though I know that I am attempting to do so, I 1 38 The Nature of Value cannot succeed in deceiving myself, since my knowing that I am attempting to do so necessarily precludes any possibility of the success of such an endeavor. This, it might be argued, is the case for the fol\u00ad lowing reasons. To attempt to deceive is to attempt to lead the person I am endeav\u00ad oring to deceive to believe either ( 1) that some proposition I believe to be false is true or (2) that some proposition I believe to be true is false. To do this, however, I must know that I believe that the proposition I am endeavoring to deceive someone intq believing is ( 1) true if I am attempting to deceive him into believing it to be false or (2) false if I am attempting to deceive him into believing it to be true. I can successfully attempt to lead another to believe either ( 1) that a given proposition is true while I know that I believe it to be false or (2) that a given propo\u00ad sition is false while I know that I believe it to be true. But I cannot suc\u00ad cessfully attempt to lead myself to believe either (1) or (2). It might be possible for me to attempt to deceive myself into believing either ( 1) or (2). But it is not possible for me to succeed in such an endeavor. To do so I must come either ( 1) to believe that a given proposition is true while I also know that I believe it to be false or (2) to believe that a given proposition is false while I also know that I believe it to be true. If, how\u00ad ever, I am to know that I believe that a given proposition is true ( or false) I must believe that it is, since if I do not believe that it is true (or false) I cannot know that I believe that it is.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
