{"paragraph": " Although endeavoring to live one's life as God Himself would live His life were He incarnate in human form might have greater intrinsic value than anything else in the created world could conceivably have, nothing con\u00ad ceivable could have an intrinsic value as great as that of the existence independently of man and the world of that than which no greater can be conceived. From the preceding certain consequences follow. Just as nothing con\u00ad ceivable could have a positive value as great as that of the existence of that than which no greater can be conceived, so also nothing conceiv\u00ad able could have as great a negative value as the non-existence of God. Given that God is that than which no greater can be conceived, nothing conceivable can have an intrinsic goodness as great as that of the exis\u00ad tence of God, and nothing conceivable could be as intrinsically bad as the non-existence of God. If, then, to use the language of Brentano, we love and hate correctly only if we love what is worthy of love and hate 120 The Nature of Value what is worthy of hate and also only if we love most what is most worthy of love and hate most what is most worthy of hate, we can love correctly only if what we want and hope for more than anything else is that God exist and also only if what we fear and dread more than any\u00ad thing else is the non-existence of God. Such loving and hating, wanting and hoping, fearing and dreading can be correct only if it is completely selfless. We ought, that is, to want God to exist and to hope that He does because the existence of nothing other than He can have an intrinsic goodness as great as that of His existence, and not simply because we believe that neither we nor the world could exist if He did not. This, however, is not to deny that the existence of God would have great instrumental value. If the existence of the world and of various of the things in it is intrinsically good, and if their coming into being and continuing to exist from moment to moment depend upon the creating and conserving activity of God, then His existence has not only an intrinsic but also an instrumental goodness greater than that of any other conceivable thing.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
