{"paragraph": " When it is we ought to engage in such deceit; when it is not we need not bother. In this way the unmitigated egoist, who recognizes that compli\u00ad ance with the requirements of non-egoistic morality is only sometimes, not always, necessary as a means to the promotion of one's long-term interests, escapes the difficulty in question. This difficulty is also escaped by the unmitigated non-egoist. Since he 1 60 The Nature of Value holds a non-egoistic view of both rationality and morality, no conflict can occur between what rationality requires and what morality requires. Instead, those acts that satisfy the requirements of rationality also satisfy the requirements of morality and vice versa. Thus both unmitigated egoism and unmitigated non-egoism escape the difficulty confronting those, whether they be rationalists or moderate moralists, who hold an egoistic view of rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality. They also escape a certain difficulty confronting not only the rationalist and the moderate moralist but :ilso the extreme moralist and the position that takes an egoistic view of morality and a non-egoistic view of rationality. The difficulty in question arises from the fact that each of these positions holds either ( 1) an egoistic view of rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality or (2) a non-egoistic view of ratio\u00ad nality and an egoistic view of morality. By holding either ( 1) or (2 ), advocates of any of these positions must finally admit, once the impli\u00ad cations of such positions are recognized, that certain acts can be rational without being morally right and that certain other acts can be morally right without being rational. Consistency therefore requires them to regard certain acts as being rational but morally wrong and cer\u00ad tain other acts as being morally right but irrational. Confronted with such a consequence, they will also be confronted at times with situa\u00ad tions in which they must choose between ( 1) acting rationally but wrongly and (2) acting rightly but irrationally.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
