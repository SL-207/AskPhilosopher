{"paragraph": " Non-physical phenomena are defined correspondingly as phenomena that are nei- ther posited by physical theory nor constituted by such posits. The deferential strategy is popular, but it leads to a problem. Which physical theory is relevant? Presumably not current physical theory. Current physical theory is incomplete and probably inaccurate in some ways. How about completed (or ideal) physical theory? Com- pleted physical theory is, by definition, complete and accurate, and so the concerns about current physical theory do not arise. But there is another concern. We don\u2019t know the content of completed physical theory, at least not yet. So, we don\u2019t know what phenomena ideal physics will posit. What if that science ends up positing fundamental mental features? For all we know, it might (Chalmers and McQueen 2022). And if it does, then even fundamental, irreducible mentality, of the sort dualists claim exists, would qualify as physical. And that\u2019s problematic. It would undermine the contrast between physicalism and dualism. This problem was raised by Carl Hempel (1966) and has been developed more recently by Barbara Gail Montero (1999). DISCUSSION Some take Hempel\u2019s dilemma to imply that the physicalism/dual- ism contrast, along with the surrounding debate, should be discarded (Crane and Mellor 1990). But most respond in a less extreme fashion. Some accept the first horn of the dilemma, arguing that we should define the physical by reference to current physical theory despite its shortcomings. Andrew Melnyk (1997) takes this line, noting that a sci- entist might favor a scientific hypothesis without believing it is true\u2014 and, indeed, without believing that it is even more likely to be true than false. They might favor that hypothesis because it is better than all contemporary and historical rival hypotheses. Similarly, \u00adMelnyk suggests, for the purposes of defining the physical, what matters is only that current physical theory is better than all contemporary and historical rival theories.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
