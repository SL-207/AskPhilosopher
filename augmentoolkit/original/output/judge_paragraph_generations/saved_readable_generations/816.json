{"paragraph": " At least two things are wrong with such a view. The first is that it provides no support of the position of the egoist. This is because the promotion of your interests as well as the promotion of mine can be good both for me and also for you in the sense that I as well as you take an interest in or desire the promotion both of your interests and also of mine. This leads to the second thing wrong with the view in question. To say that some\u00ad thing, x, is good for someone can mean only either of two things. It might mean that it is beneficial for him. In this sense of the expression, an injection of insulin can be good for a diabetic person but bad for someone who is not diabetic. The fact, however, that something can be good for someone in this sense of the expression provides no support for 'the egoist, since the admission that various things are good for var\u00ad ious people in the sense in question is compatible with a rejection of egoism. The second thing that might be meant by saying that something is good for someone is that he regards it as being or believes it to be Morality and Rationality 167 good. Something can be good for someone in this sense without being good for him in the previous sense and vice versa. Thus someone who is not diabetic can believe that injections of insulin are good for diabetic people but not good for himself, and injections of insulin can be good for a diabetic person even though he does not believe that they are. If I am diabetic and you are not, injections of insulin can be good for me and bad for you in the sense that they would be beneficial for me but harmful for you, yet also good for you and bad for me in the sense that you believe them to be beneficial for me and I believe them to be harmful for me (and perhaps also for anyone else, regardless of whether he be diabetic). The fact, however, that various things can be good or bad for various people in either or both of these senses is compatible with the view that various things are intrinsically good or bad regard\u00ad less of whether they are good or bad for anyone in either of the senses in question.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
