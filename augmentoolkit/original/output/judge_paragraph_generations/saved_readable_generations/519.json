{"paragraph": " This is the idea that in order for knowledge or justified belief to transmit from one person to the other, it is necessary that the testifier has knowledge/justified belief. Another aspect of the transmission view of testimony is that having a particular epistemic good is sufficient for transmitting that epistemic good to others. In other words, if a testifier actually does know/justifiedly believe that p, then that is sufficient to make it so that someone who believes that p on the basis of the testifier\u2019s testimony will also thereby come to know/jus- tifiedly believe that p. In terms of the bucket brigade metaphor from the pre- vious entry, the idea is that as long as the testifier has water in their bucket that is sufficient for the next person in line to receive a bucket full of water.

The paramedics arrive and pronounce that she has had a massive heartache, then rush her off TRANSMISSION VIEW OF TESTIMONY\u2014SUFFICIENCY 175 to the hospital. One reporter for a local news outlet happens to be within earshot of the paramedics when they tell this news to the can- didate\u2019s campaign manager. Unfortunately, the reporter wasn\u2019t record- ing the exchange, but he does immediately pull out his phone and call his editor to give her the scoop. So Small Town News starts working up the story to release on their website and to put in their print newspa- per. At the same time, the quick-thinking campaign manager imme- diately makes an announcement on social media that the candidate is in perfect health and taking a bit of a vacation from the campaign trail. He even posts pictures of the candidate and her family on a beach\u2014pictures that he has had saved on his phone in the case of just such an emergency. Afterward, the candidate\u2019s political party exerts a tremendous amount of energy and resources to keep the real story out of the hands of any of the major media outlets.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
