{"paragraph": " 4. Positive, Negative, and Conflicting Duties If the preceding is correct, then attempting to deceive is not always intrinsically worse than remaining silent, and some instances of remaining silent can be intrinsically worse than some instances of attempting to deceive. The issue at stake here is similar to two other issues. One is the issue of whether any duty not to perform an act of a certain type is always weightier than a duty to perform an act of a cer\u00ad tain other type. Duties of the first type are sometimes called negative duties, those of the second type positive duties. If the duty not to deceive is a negative duty and the duty to remain silent a positive duty, then neg\u00ad ative duties are not always weightier than positive duties, since the duty not to deceive, taken as a negative duty, is not always more stringent than the duty to remain silent, taken as a positive duty. It might, how\u00ad ever, seem strange to regard the duty to remain silent as a positive duty, since, being a duty not to speak, it is a duty not to do something. There are nonetheless other duties that seem clearly to show that negative duties are not always weightier than positive duties. Thus the negative duty not to deceive is overridden by the positive duty to save human life in a situation in which I can save a human life only by deceiving another intent upon wrongly taking that life. The second issue referred to above is the issue of whether an order of stringency of specific duties can be established in which all duties can be ranked in terms of their stringency in such a way that any given duty is either more stringent or less stringent than any other duty in any con\u00ad ceivable situation that might arise, so that if duty b is less stringent than duty a but more stringent than duty c in some given situation, x, it is also less stringent than a and more stringent than c in any other con\u00ad ceivable situation, y.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
