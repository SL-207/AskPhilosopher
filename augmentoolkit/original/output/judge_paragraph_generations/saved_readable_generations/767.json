{"paragraph": " If, however, he does know both (a) and (b), then his remaining silent or his attempting to deceive does have an intrinsic value that otherwise it would not have. This is the case because the intrinsic value of an act is determined, at least in part, by the nature of the agent's intention in acting. It will be convenient here, despite what was said above, to treat not only attempting to deceive but also remaining silent as acts. If I intend by acting to bring about certain consequences that I know, or could rea\u00ad sonably be expected to know, to be bad, then my act is intrinsically as well as extrinsically bad. Indeed, the act itself can still be intrinsically bad even though it be extrinsically good. This would happen if the act, rather than issuing in the bad consequences I intended to bring about, has instead good consequences unintended and unforeseen by me. If this were to happen, my act would be extrinsically good but intrinsi\u00ad cally bad. Suppose now that I attempt to deceive another person about some utterly trivial matter. If so, then my act is intrinsically bad, although only slightly so, regardless of whether my attempt at decep\u00ad tion succeeds, and thus regardless of whether it is also extrinsically bad. Suppose also that on another occasion I remain silent about some matter of great importance to another, that my remaining silent has 130 The Nature of Value consequences having great negative intrinsic value, and that I know it will have such consequences. If so, then my remaining silent is both intrinsically and extrinsically bad. As before, however, it is still intrinsi\u00ad cally bad regardless of whether it is also extrinsically bad, as it would not be if it has neither the consequences in question nor any other bad consequences. Its negative intrinsic value would also be considerably greater than that of my attempting to deceive another about some utterly trivial matter.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
