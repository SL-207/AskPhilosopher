{"paragraph": " If they came to believe various of the truths they cannot bear to face, or if they came even to doubt various of their beliefs that conflict with such truths, their lives would be hopelessly shattered. Compassion for their condition therefore requires that we refrain from saying or doing any\u00ad thing that might cause them to lose or even to doubt the beliefs they are happy in holding, and even that we attempt to deceive them into believing that we too believe what they believe if we believe that such The Primacy of Practical Rationality 1 35 deception is necessary to avoid the m;ihappy consequences that would issue from their losing or coming to doubt their beliefs. They, however, cannot rightly attempt to deceive themselves, nor could we were we in their situation. Although I can justifiably attempt to hide certain truths from others, either by remaining silent or by resorting to deception, if I believe correctly that their lives would be shattered if they were to lose or to come to doubt certain of their beliefs that conflict with these truths, I can never justifiably attempt to deceive myself even though it be necessary that I do so to avoid facing certain truths I cannot bear to face. What reasons, if any, can be given in support of such a position? One reason that might be given is that the consequences for others if they lost or came to doubt certain of their beliefs would be worse than the consequences for me if I lost or came to doubt certain of my beliefs. This, however, is not a good reason, since the consequences for me if I lost or came to doubt certain of my beliefs might well be as bad as the consequences for others if they lost or came to doubt certain of their beliefs. Just as their lives would be shattered, so also might mine. Another reason that might be given is that attempts to deceive oneself are intrinsically worse than attempts to deceive others. This too is not a good reason, since whether an attempt to deceive oneself is intrinsically worse than an attempt to deceive others depends upon the importance, either for oneself or for others, of whatever it is that one is attempting to deceive oneself or others into believing.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
