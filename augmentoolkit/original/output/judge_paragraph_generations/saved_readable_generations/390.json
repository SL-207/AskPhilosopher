{"paragraph": " When it comes to morality, we can distinguish between merely doing the right thing and doing the right thing for the right reasons. For example, if you help an elderly person across a busy street, you are doing the right thing. But, if you help this person across the street only so that you can rob this person, you did the right thing (helping the elderly person across the street) but for the wrong reason (rather than to help, it was to rob the per- son). The same sort of thing applies in epistemology. There\u2019s the right thing to believe (what you have justification for believing) and there\u2019s believing the right thing for the right reasons (justifiedly believing). In order to have KNOWLEDGE AND BASING 43 justification for believing some claim, you have to have good reasons/evi- dence for thinking that the claim is true. In order to justifiedly believe some claim, you not only have to have good reasons for thinking the claim is true, but you also have to believe the claim because of those good reasons, i.e. you have to base your belief on those reasons. The relation that your belief has to bear to your justification for that belief to count as justified is known as the \u201cbasing relation\u201d. Why is this so important? One reason is that most epistemologists agree that in order to have knowledge that some proposition, p, is true, you must justifiedly believe that p. That is to say, it is not enough that p is true, you believe p, and you have justification for believing p (and you satisfy what- ever is needed to block Gettier cases; see Promotions and Traveling Friends pp. 6\u201311 and A Strange County pp. 16\u201320). Knowledge requires that your belief that p is actually based on your justification for p. The most common view of the basing relation is that it is a causal or counterfactual dependence relation. On this understanding of the basing relation a person\u2019s belief that p is based on her evidence for p when hav- ing that evidence causes her to have the belief that p, or (assuming that causation isn\u2019t simply a matter of counterfactual dependence) the person\u2019s belief counterfactually depends upon her having evidence that supports believing that p.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
