{"paragraph": " If the preceding is correct, we evaluate various likings, dislikings, valuings, and evaluations, both those of our own and also those of others, as being appropriate or inappropriate, fitting or unfitting, right or wrong, good or bad. That we like or dislike various likings, dislik\u00ad ings, valuings, and evaluations of others seems obvious enough. We tend to like those of others with which we agree and to dislike those with which we disagree. And that we like various of those of our own also seems obvious enough. It also seems obvious that we sometimes dislike various of those of our own in the past, especially when they conflict with our present likings, dislikings, and valuings. But that we can and sometimes do like those of others that disagree with our own and sometimes dislike our own present likings, dislikings, or valuings is not so obvious. Yet I believe that in fact we sometimes do. Thus I might like some valuing or evaluation of yours even though it disagrees with one of mine because I believe yours to be honest, conscientious, and judicious. It might, however, be objected that if I like your evaluation on these grounds even though it disagress with mine, it is not your evaluation I like but rather its honesty, conscientiousness, and judiciousness. This, I think, would be a mistake. From the fact that we like something beca\u03dase it has certain characteristics it does not follow that we like only its characteristics and not the thing itself that has these characteristics. In general, we like the things we like and dislike the things we dislike because of the characteristics they have or that we believe they have. Value and Psychological Phenomena 1 1 Although we might also like or dislike various of their characteristics, we also like or dislike the things themselves. I cannot, however, like some evaluation of yours that disagrees with one of mine because I believe yours to be acceptable, correct, or true, since if it disagrees with one of my own evaluations, and I know or believe that it does, I cannot, believing that my own evaluation is acceptable, correct, or true, believe also that yours is too.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
