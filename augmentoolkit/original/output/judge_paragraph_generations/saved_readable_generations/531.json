{"paragraph": " Some insist that these sorts of cases as well as arguments that support pragmatic encroachment (see Going to the Bank pp. 48\u201352 and Winning the Lottery pp. 80\u201384) equally support moral encroachment (of course, others contend that the arguments against pragmatic encroachment are equally arguments against moral encroachment) (Fritz 2017). RESPONSES Many who accept moral encroachment insist that while moral con- cerns affect whether someone should believe that p outright, they don\u2019t affect what credence it is rational to have. Basically, the idea here is that many supporters of moral encroachment think that Karen is rational in holding that it is 80\u201395% likely that the customer will leave a bad tip, but she isn\u2019t justified in believing that he will leave a bad tip. Hence, the moral import of her belief affects whether or not that credence is high enough to justify outright belief that the person is going to leave a bad tip, but moral concerns don\u2019t affect what credence one should have. However, some contend that if the arguments for moral encroachment work in the case of outright belief, they also work when it comes to rational credence (Fritz and Jackson forthcoming). In other words, if Karen shouldn\u2019t believe in this case, she also shouldn\u2019t have the high credence normally supported by the evidence she has. As we have been discussing, one response to this sort of case is to accept moral encroachment, i.e. accept that Karen\u2019s belief (and per- haps her credence) isn\u2019t justified because of the moral importance of the belief. There are differences of opinion among those who accept moral encroachment as to where exactly the problem lies with \u00adKaren\u2019s belief though. Some argue that while statistical information like what she has is good evidence in some cases, it fails to justify when it is demographic evidence, such as when we\u2019re thinking about an entire people group (Munton 2019).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
