{"paragraph": " Thus the acceptance of the conjunc\u00ad tive proposition, p and q, might well work, in the sense in question, even though it is impossible that such a proposition be true. Moreover, the acceptance of such a self-inconsistent proposition might also be per\u00ad fectly rational from the standpoint of practical reason, since it would work in the sense in question, even though it cannot be rational from the standpoint of theoretical reason, since the proposition in question, being self-inconsistent, necessarily is false. Although from the standpoint of practical reason it is sometimes rational to accept a proposition even though we have no more evidence for believing it to be true than for believing it to be false, and indeed even though we have more evidence for believing it to be false than for believing it to be true, to do so cannot be rational from the standpoint of theoretical reason. Instead, from the latter standpoint it is rational to accept a given proposition only if we have more evidence for believing it to be true than we have for believing it to be false. This difference between the two standpoints concerning what it is rational for us to believe could not arise if the interest of each standpoint were identical with that of the other. It is because the goal of theoretical reason is the acquisition of knowledge that we ought, from the standpoint of theo\u00ad retical reason, to accept a proposition only if the evidence we have for its truth is greater than the evidence we have for its falsity. And it is because the goal of practical reason is the attainment of something other than knowledge that sometimes we ought, from this standpoint, to accept a proposition even though we have no more evidence for believing it to be true than for believing it to be false, and sometimes even though we have more evidence for believing it to be false than for believing it to be true. Some doubtless will dislike talk about the end, goal, or purpose of practical and theoretical reason.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
