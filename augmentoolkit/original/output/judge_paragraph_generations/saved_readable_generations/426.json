{"paragraph": " The second basic sort of response is to argue that although it may seem like there could be a demon that operates in exactly this sort of way, the debasing demon is in fact impossible (Bondy and Carter 2018). The idea here is that it is impossible for our beliefs to seem to us that they are held on the basis of good reasons when in fact they are not. If this is correct, then it appears that initial appearances not- withstanding the debasing demon is not actually a genuine possibility. Of course, this general approach to responding to the debasing demon seems to assume that something other than causal or counterfactual dependence is sufficient for basing.

Even if the strangeness of demon scenarios and five minutes old universes allows us to simply ignore the skeptical challenges that they raise, there are other skep- tical challenges that are not so easily dismissed. Lottery skepticism raises challenges to our knowledge that don\u2019t rely on such scenarios at all.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
