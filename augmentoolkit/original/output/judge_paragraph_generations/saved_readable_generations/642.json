{"paragraph": " The emergence of something that can be good or bad out of what may be referred to as its ontological elements or constituents, none of which, taken singly or abstractly, can be good or bad, is only one of a variety of forms of emergence. Provided that cer\u00ad tain assumptions be made, it is perhaps also an example of Moore's principle of organic wholes, according to which \"the value of a whole must not be assumed to be the same as the sum of the values of its parts. \" 8 The assumptions in question are these. In the case of universals, the exemplification by a given particular of a given universal may be con\u00ad sidered to be what may be referred to as an ontological whole con\u00ad sisting of ontological constituents, elements, or parts, one of which is the universal in question, taken completely in abstraction from the question of whether it is exemplified by anything at all, and another of which is the particular in question, taken completely in abstraction from the question of which universals it exemplifies. So considered, neither of these abstract parts can be good or bad, whereas the whole consisting of the exemplification of the universal in question by the particular in question can be good or bad. In the case of states of af\u00ad fairs, the obtaining of a given state of affairs is an ontological whole consisting of ontological parts, one of which is the state of affairs in question, taken completely in abstraction from the question of whether it obtains, and another of which is the obtaining or the non-obtaining of a state of affairs, taken completely in abstraction from the nature of the state of affairs in question. So considered, neither of these abstract 32 The Nature of Value parts can be good or bad, whereas the whole consisting of the ob\u00ad taining of the state of affairs in question can be good or bad. Since Moore does not make clear precisely what is to count as a whole and what is to count as a part, I am not sure that the preceding would be examples covered by his principle of organic wholes.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
