{"paragraph": " Smith and Jones work for the same company, and they are both vying for the same promotion. Smith can\u2019t help but do a bit of snooping concerning who got the promotion. As a result of his snooping, Smith comes to have excel- lent reasons for believing that Jones got the promotion, though it hasn\u2019t been officially announced yet. He overheard the boss saying that Jones got the promotion, he saw a letter congratulating Jones on the promotion, and he even saw the new plaque that will go on THE GETTIER PROBLEM 7 the coveted corner office that belongs to the person who got the promotion and it had \u201cJones\u201d on it. On the basis of this information, Smith believes that Jones got the promotion. Smith also knows that Jones owns an \u00adArmani jacket. While sitting at his desk, Smith gets bored and starts thinking about facts concerning the person who got the promotion. He thinks to himself, \u201cJones got the promotion and Jones owns an Armani jacket,\u201d so \u201cthe person who got the promotion owns an Armani jacket.\u201d So far the case of Smith and Jones is not all that interesting. How- ever, let\u2019s consider a twist to the narrative. Imagine Smith also owns an Armani jacket. And despite all of the evidence, it is actually Smith who got the job\u2014he misheard the boss, the letter congratulating Jones was for a different Jones and a different promotion, and the new plaque was for the other Jones and her new office. Does Smith know that the person who got the promotion owns an Armani jacket? It doesn\u2019t seem so. But, this appears to be a problem for the traditional account of knowledge. Smith justifiedly believes that Jones got the promotion, he knows that Jones owns an Armani jacket, and on the\u00a0basis of his justified belief and knowledge he comes to believe that the person who got the promotion owns an Armani jacket. This belief is true because Smith owns such a jacket and he\u2019s the one who got the pro- motion.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
