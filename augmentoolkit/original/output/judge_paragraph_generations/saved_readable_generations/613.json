{"paragraph": " Thus I can like looking at the accident vie- Value and Psychological Phenomena 9 tims without being ashamed of doing.so and can be ashamed of doing so without regarding my being ashamed as appropriate or inappro\u00ad priate. But I cannot regard my being _ashamed as appropriate or inap\u00ad propriate if I am not or do not believe that I am ashamed, and I cannot be ashamed of liking to look at the victims if I do not or believe that I do not like looking at them. This is connected with the fact that what may be referred to as \"the immediate object\" of a third-order phenomenon is some second-order phenomenon and that of a second-order phenomenon some first-order phenomenon. The object of a first-order phenomenon, although it is the immediate object of the first-order phenomenon alone, may perhaps be referred to as \"the mediate object\" or at least as part of the immediate object of the corresponding second-order and third-order phenomena. Thus a first-order phenomenon cannot be the object of a second-order phenomenon and a second-order phenomenon the object of a third\u00ad order phenomenon unless the object of the first-order phenomenon is at least indirectly intended in intending the first-order or the second-order phenomenon. If, that is, I am 'to like, dislike, evaluate, or value my liking to look at the accident victims, I must have as an intentional object not only my liking to look at the victims but also the victims themselves. Precisely similar considerations apply to third-order phe\u00ad nomena. I cannot think of my being ashamed of my liking to look at the victims without thereby also thinking ( 1) not only of my being ashamed of my liking to look at them and (2) of my liking to look at them but also (3) of the victims themselves. If so, then the immediate object of a first-order phenomenon carries over, so to speak, as part of the object of second-order and third-order phenomena.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
