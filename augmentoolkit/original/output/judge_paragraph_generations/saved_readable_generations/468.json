{"paragraph": " 23 THE UNFORTUNATE TWIN (NEW\u00a0EVIL DEMON PROBLEM) Background: There are two important things to remember for understanding this case. The first is the difference between internalism and externalism (see General Background: The Nature of Justification pp. 113\u2013119). Most importantly, it is key to recall that externalist theories of justification claim that you can be justified in believing that p, even if you have no evidence or mentally accessible reason for p at all. The second thing to keep in mind is the nature of Cartesian skepticism. This is the sort of skepticism covered in Descartes\u2019 Demon (pp. 55\u201360). The idea here being that it is possible that one could be deceived by a demon or be a brain in a vat and yet have all of the sorts of experiences that we normally have. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: EPISTEMIC JUSTIFICATION: EXTERNALISM VS. INTERNALISM; NEW EVIL DEMON PROBLEM Like any normal adult, Jenny has many justified beliefs (i.e. beliefs that she holds rationally/for good reasons). For example, Jenny believes that her phone number is 867-5309 for good reasons\u2014she has mem- ories that this is her number. Right now, she justifiedly believes that she is reading this book because the sort of experiences she is having right now provide good reasons to believe that she is reading a book NEW EVIL DEMON PROBLEM 121 (her experiences are very similar to your current experiences). And so on. As we noted, Jenny, like most of us, believes a lot of things for good reasons. So, she has a lot of justified beliefs. This fact is not really surprising or on its own all that interesting. Now, let\u2019s think about someone who is very similar to Jenny. No, not just similar. Let\u2019s think of someone who is mentally exactly like Jenny. This person has all of the same beliefs that Jenny has and all of the same reasons for those beliefs too. For instance, this person be- lieves that they are reading this book because they are having an expe- rience that is indistinguishable from Jenny\u2019s current experience; they also believe that their phone number is 867-5309 because they have memories that are indistinguishable from Jenny\u2019s memories of her phone number.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
