{"paragraph": " He decides to see his cardiologist, who examines him and does extensive lab work and tests. Shortly thereaf- ter Bhavith gets a call that he needs to come back in for a follow-up visit as soon as possible. On his arrival, the doctor greets Bhavith with PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 262 a grave demeanor. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have some bad news,\u201d she says. \u201cThe tests we did revealed that you have an incurable and untreatable heart defect. Based on similar cases like yours, we expect that you have only months to live.\u201d As Bhavith struggles to absorb this news, he realizes that the doctor is still speaking. \u201cEven though there is no treatment or cure, I do have one possible option for you,\u201d she says. An interesting procedure has been developed by an interdisciplinary re- search team working at the Humans of Tomorrow Institute. They\u2019d scan your brain and body and make a record of your mental and physical config- uration. When the scan is complete, they\u2019ll design an android body based on your own current body and then upload your mind pattern to a com- puter that operates the android body. They\u2019ll dispose of the old biological shell, and you\u2019ll be able to continue on just as before with the new body. Given that these android bodies last a very long time and can be easily replaced if they ever do wear out or suffer damage, this procedure lets you live on indefinitely, even forever if you\u2019d like. This procedure hasn\u2019t yet been made available to the general public, since the Institute is still trying to get the insurance companies to cover patient costs. I have some connections and could get you an appointment. I know this is a lot to take in, but I think it\u2019s a really great option for you. My understanding is that it\u2019s worked very well so far. All my patients who have undergone the scan- ning and uploading procedure have been very happy with the results. It\u2019s expensive, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s well within your means.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
