{"paragraph": " This is an example of change blindness. Change 37 Change Blindness 225 blindness is common, and it has been demonstrated in the lab and in the field. In one study (Simons and Levin 1998), an experimenter asks an unsuspecting pedestrian for directions. While the pedestrian is busy pointing at a map and explaining the directions, two people carrying a door pass between them\u2014so for a moment the person asking direc- tions is behind the door\u2014and the experimenter slyly changes places with one of the people carrying the door. About half of the pedestri- ans in the study didn\u2019t notice that, after the door passed by, they were talking with a different person, dressed entirely differently from the first person. Both cognitive scientists and philosophers have reflected on what change blindness shows about perceptual experience and consciousness more generally. Consider the first example, and think about the first time you looked at drawing A. Did you see the glasses? Were they part of your conscious, visual experience? Consider another example (Dretske 2007). Sarah looks at seven people gathered around a table, each of whom is clearly visible to her. She looks at them for several seconds, and then briefly looks away. While she looks away, an eighth person, Sam, joins the group. He too is clearly visible. When Sarah looks back, she doesn\u2019t notice the difference. Does Sarah see Sam? Several philosophers and cognitive psychologists say the answer to both questions is no. Sarah didn\u2019t see Sam, and you didn\u2019t see the glasses (until you looked the third time). Those \u201cno\u201d answers reflect the view that perceptual consciousness is sparse. That is, conscious percep- tion is more informationally impoverished than we tend to assume it is. We do not see pretty much everything that a color photograph would capture (the blindspot area notwithstanding). A photograph of the eight people in Sarah\u2019s field of vision would depict Sam.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
