{"paragraph": " Part of what is meant by saying that the complete good of a person consists in his having goods and in being good is that neither of these constituents of the complete good is re\u00ad ducible to the other and that neither is merely a means to the acquisi\u00ad tion of the other. Having goods of various kinds is by itself neither nec\u00ad essary nor sufficient for being good, and being good by itself is neither necessary nor sufficient for having goods of various types. Having goods has a value in itself independently of any contribution it might make to a person's being good, and being good is valuable in itself in\u00ad dependently of any contribution it might make to one's having goods of various kinds. It is good, although good in a non-moral sense, to have goods regardless of whether having them contributes to one's being good; and it is also good, in a moral sense of \"good,\" to be good regardless of whether being so contributes to one's having various goods. Any view of the complete good for man that does not include both these constituents is one-sided. Few people today would regard a person's good as consisting simply in his being good, regardless of whether he also has goods of various types. There have, however, been philosophers who have come close to doing so, such as certain of the Cynics and Stoics of classical Greece and Rome. Surely, however, a morally good person who is healthy, well-off financially, educated, respected, and graced with facial and bodily beauty is better off than a good person who is sick, impoverished, une\u00ad ducated, held in contempt, and ugly both in face and body. The Stoic view, if we may so term it, is hopelessly one-sided, even though from a moral point of view it is one-sided in the right direction. This view, The Complete Human Good and Higher Education 203 however, is not likely to be adopted by many of us today, any more than it was embraced by many people during the centuries Stoicism flour\u00ad ished as a philosophical movement\u045d Our tendency today, like that of most people at any time, is to be one-sided in the opposite direction.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
