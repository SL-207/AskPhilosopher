{"paragraph": " It seems that seeing a book on the shelf in the library equally confirms/provides support for thinking \u201chay muchos libros en la biblioteca\u201d. Why? Because these statements mean the same thing. They are logically equivalent to one another. Similarly, evidence that confirms \u201cif today is Saturday, then there\u2019s no class\u201d equally con- firms \u201cif there\u2019s class, then today isn\u2019t Saturday\u201d. Again, the reason is that these statements are logically equivalent. The idea that logically Ravens Paradox 213 equivalent statements are confirmed to the same degree by the same evidence is known as the \u201cEquivalence condition.\u201d Here\u2019s something else that seems true. Universal claims are con- firmed/supported by their positive instances. In other words, observ- ing a green emerald confirms (at least to some degree) the claim that all emeralds are green. This principle is known as the \u201cNicod condi- tion\u201d (it is called this because French philosopher Jean Nicod was the first to explicitly endorse the principle in print). Although both the Equivalence condition and the Nicod condition are intuitively plausible conditions on confirmation, together they generate what is known as the Ravens Paradox. Let\u2019s take a look at this. First, we start with the Nicod condition. Observing a black raven provides confirmation for the claim that all ravens are black. So far, so good. According to the Equivalence condition, any evidence for \u201call ravens are black\u201d is equally good evidence for \u201call nonblack things are non-ravens\u201d because these two claims are logically equivalent. Hence, observing a black raven is evidence for \u201call nonblack things are non-ravens\u201d. There doesn\u2019t appear to be a problem. But what about when we look at the other side of things? Let\u2019s consider another observation that confirms \u201call nonblack things are non-ravens\u201d\u2014observing a white piece of chalk. Since a white piece of chalk is a nonblack non-raven, the Nicod condition holds that it confirms (to some degree) that all nonblack things are non-ravens.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
