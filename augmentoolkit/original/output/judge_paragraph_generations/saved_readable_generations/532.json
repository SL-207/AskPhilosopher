{"paragraph": " Others claim that the moral reasons for her not to form this belief themselves provide defeaters for her belief. Yet others claim that the risks involved with getting a morally charged MORAL ENCROACHMENT 189 belief wrong make it so that more evidence is required for justifica- tion. Regardless, all of these ways of cashing out moral encroachment yield the result that evidentialism gets things wrong because moral concerns affect what is justified. Another sort of response to these cases is to insist that while Karen has a moral obligation to treat this person like she would anyone else the moral facts simply don\u2019t affect what is epistemically justified for her. The thought here is that the intuition that there is something wrong with Karen\u2019s belief is really tracking facts about how she should treat this person, not facts about what she should believe (Osborne 2021). Of course, this sort of response defends evidentialism because it is consistent with this response to claim that evidentialism is correct about what Karen should believe. A different sort of response attempts to get the result that Karen shouldn\u2019t believe as she does without impugning evidentialism in the process. One route those offering this response go is to argue that in this sort of situation, Karen has additional evidence that makes it so that her belief isn\u2019t justified (Gardiner 2018). She might have evidence concerning how this person is dressed, for instance in an expensive suit, that would counteract the statistical evidence that she has. Alter- natively, one might argue that Karen\u2019s belief, while justified, might easily become unjustified because statistical evidence is precarious, in the sense that it is easily undermined by other evidence. And so, insist that it is this feature of her belief that leads us to mistakenly think that it isn\u2019t justified in the case as described.
