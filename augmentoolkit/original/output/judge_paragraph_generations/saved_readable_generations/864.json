{"paragraph": " This leads them to endeavor to deceive themselves into believing that they are not bad. Such an aversion to thinking of oneself as bad or to admitting to oneself that one is bad and such attempts at self-deception would be impossible if one placed no intrinsic value at all upon being oneself a good person. 4 If the preceding is correct, most people do not in fact value as an end only the having of various goods. At least to some extent, they also value as an end being good. This means that they believe, at least implicitly, that the complete good does in fact consist of the two con\u00ad stituents indicated above and that neither constituent is reducible to or eliminable in favor of the other. This is not to say that they hold such a belief explicitly or that they would express it in the language I have used were they to become aware of the fact that they hold it at least implic\u00ad itly. To say, however, that most people place at least some intrinsic value on being good is not to say that they value it as much as they value having various of the goods they happen to want. The relative value we place on each of these two constituents of the complete good is at least The Complete Human Good and Higher Education 205 one of the factors involved in determining how we act in situations in which we cannot both have certain goods we want and also act rightly. In such situations we must choose between ( 1) getting the goods in question at the cost of acting wrongly and (2) acting rightly at the cost of forgoing the goods in question. To the degree to which we are bad persons we tend to choose the first alternative; to the degree to which we are good we tend to choose the second. Few, if any, of us are com\u00ad pletely good; and few, if any, of us are completely bad. Some people have goods of certain sorts that others do not have and do not have goods of certain other sorts that others do have, and some people on the whole have a greater quantity of various goods than others have.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
