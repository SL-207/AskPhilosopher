There are everyday cases of misperception\u2014as when a drink- ing straw in a glass of water looks bent or when orange juice tastes foul after brushing your teeth. There are also more extreme scenarios where we can be in error. You could be hallucinating a hedgehog, or could be fooled about all external appearances by an evil demon who systematically deceives you. Even though we can be very wrong in these cases, it seems there is something we cannot be wrong about: the way things seem to us. The straw seems bent and there seems to be a hedgehog. This epistemological point slides naturally into a meta- physical view: though we might be wrong about there being a pink elephant, we nonetheless have an internal image of a pink elephant. Internal states such as images determine how things seem to us. As such, if such internal states seem a certain way, they are that way. Some philosophers put the point in terms of there being a \u201ccommon factor\u201d between perceptions and misperceptions. There is something mental 33 Color Swatches and Speckled Hens 201 in common between a hallucination of a hedgehog and a perception of a hedgehog: the sense impression or internal image of a hedgehog. While we can be wrong about there really being a hedgehog, we can\u2019t be wrong about the image of a hedgehog. We can call this the theory of seemings. The theory of seemings typically has two parts, one met- aphysical and one epistemological: (1) when something seems like F to you, there is a mental image or a \u201cseeming\u201d that is F; and (2) you cannot be wrong about whether that seeming is F.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
