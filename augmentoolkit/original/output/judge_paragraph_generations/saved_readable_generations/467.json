{"paragraph": " In order to help illustrate the differences between internalism and externalism, it will be helpful to look at a prominent version of each. Evidentialism is a prominent form of internalism that says that a person\u2019s justification at a particular time depends solely upon the evidence that the person has at that time. Evidentialists understand \u201cevidence\u201d quite broadly so that it includes a person\u2019s memories, sen- sations, experiences, and so on. Hence, an evidentialist would say that Rich has propositional justification for believing that p, if and only if the evidence that Rich has on the whole supports thinking that p is true. That is to say, Rich has to have more reason for thinking that p is true than he does for thinking that p is false. And, assuming that Rich\u2019s belief that p is appropriately based on his evidence in support of p, evidentialism yields the result that Rich\u2019s belief is justified. On the externalist side, a prominent theory is reliabilism. The gen- eral idea of reliabilism is that beliefs are justified if and only if they are produced by reliable belief-forming processes. On reliabilism, what matters is whether Rich\u2019s belief is formed by a belief-forming process that tends to produce more true beliefs than false beliefs. Let\u2019s think once more of Earl and Rich. Evidentialism says that since they are mental duplicates, they have the same evidence. Thus, evidentialism says that if Rich\u2019s belief that p is justified, then so is Earl\u2019s, and vice versa. Reliabilism yields a different result. It could be that Rich, but not Earl, is in an environment where his belief-forming process is reli- able. As a result, it could be that Rich\u2019s belief that p is justified because it\u2019s reliable, but Earl\u2019s isn\u2019t because his belief is unreliable. There have been several examples put forward as challenges to both internalism and externalism. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most prominent.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
