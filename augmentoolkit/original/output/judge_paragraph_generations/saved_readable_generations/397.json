{"paragraph": " What\u2019s particularly interesting about this question is that we might have the intuition that Sally spoke truly both times. In other words, Sally was correct in the first scenario when she said that Jorge knows the bank is open on Saturday, and she was correct in the sec- ond scenario when she said that Jorge doesn\u2019t know that the bank is open on Saturday. What\u2019s interesting about this? Nothing about Jorge is different in the two scenarios, nor is anything different about the bank! So, if Sally is correct in attributing knowledge to him in the first scenario and also correct in not attributing knowledge to him in the second scenario, it can\u2019t be because something about Jorge has changed from one scenario to the other. Instead, if Sally is correct NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 50 in both situations, it has to be because of the differences in her own situation between these two scenarios. The fact that the stakes are low for Sally and Sarah would have to make it easier for Jorge to count as knowing that the bank is open on Saturday than when the stakes for them are high. Keith DeRose first introduced this sort of bank case in an effort to demonstrate that the word \u201cknow\u201d is context-sensitive. To get a firmer grip on this, think about another word that is clearly context-sensitive: \u201ctall\u201d. It may be true to say of a two-year-old that he is tall when we are comparing him to other two-year-olds. However, when the con- text is the height of NBA players, it would also be true to say of the two-year-old that he isn\u2019t tall. Similarly, DeRose (and others) holds that whether it is correct to say that someone knows depends upon the context. Importantly, on this view, known as \u201ccontextualism\u201d, the relevant context is the context of the speaker (the person saying of someone that they know or don\u2019t know), not the context of the po- tential knower (if the knower is a different person from the speaker).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
