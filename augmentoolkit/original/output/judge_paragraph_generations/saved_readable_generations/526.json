{"paragraph": " She has noticed some of her colleagues staring at her while she tries to work. Some have even told her inappropriate things to her face. And more than once she has had to fend off attempts by colleagues to give her \u201cpats\u201d or \u201csqueezes\u201d in inappropriate places. Pam feels that in addition to being rude, these behaviors by her col- leagues are downright wrong; they aren\u2019t simply in \u201cgood fun\u201d like some of them have told her. While she doesn\u2019t want to be branded as EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE\u2014HERMENEUTICAL 183 someone who is difficult to work with, she knows that what\u2019s going on isn\u2019t right. Yet, Pam doesn\u2019t quite know how to put into words what\u2019s wrong about the conditions in which she finds herself. Regrettably, Pam\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t all that uncommon in the past, and it still exists today. Like the previous entry, it is clear that moral wrongs are occurring in this case; however, the idea that epistemic wrongs are also occurring has recently emerged in the epistemolog- ical literature. Since it\u2019s 1950, Pam hasn\u2019t heard of workplace har- assment or sexual harassment in general, and as a result it seems that she doesn\u2019t really have the requisite concepts to fully understand and express her situation and what\u2019s wrong about it. She doesn\u2019t have the concept of sexual harassment because it isn\u2019t yet a concept that is widely used or understood. It seems that Pam\u2019s being unable to express her situation to others, or even fully understand it herself, is a kind of epistemic injustice. In this situation, Pam is experiencing a kind of epistemic injustice that has been termed \u201chermeneutical injustice\u201d. RESPONSES Once the idea of hermeneutical injustice arose in epistemology, a number of new insights started to emerge. One such insight is that there may in fact be (at least) two important kinds of ignorance that arise from hermeneutical injustice (Fricker 2007). The first is the sort we have discussed by thinking about Pam.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
