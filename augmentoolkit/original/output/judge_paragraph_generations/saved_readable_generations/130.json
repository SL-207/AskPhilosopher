{"paragraph": " PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 124 But, as Montero (1999) observes, recognizing that a theory is supe- rior to historical and contemporary rival theories need not commit one to accepting the theory. For example, one might be a \u00adlibertarian about free will, and yet take Humean compatibilism to be \u00adsuperior to all his- torical and contemporary rival theories (perhaps one \u00adregards all such theories as failures but takes Hume\u2019s theory to be the most \u00adelegant). Yet physicalism is typically understood to involve a \u00adcommitment to its main thesis, that everything is physical, being true. A further \u00adproblem with Melnyk\u2019s approach is that limiting the competition to historical and contemporary rivals seems hard to justify, given that some future physical theories will be more accurate and more complete. Some accept the second horn of the dilemma, arguing that we should define the physical by reference to future or ideal physical the- ory and that the problems this causes can be solved. Jessica M. Wilson (2005, 2006) does this. On her characterization, physical \u00adphenomena are phenomena posited by ideal physical theory. But those posited phenomena must satisfy a further constraint: none can be funda- mentally mental. Wilson\u2019s approach is to embrace the second horn of Hempel\u2019s dilemma; but, thanks to her No Fundamental Mentality constraint, she can avoid the concern that ideal physics might posit the sort of mentality that dualists accept and physicalists reject. Other philosophers avoid Hempel\u2019s dilemma by providing a \u00adsubstantive characterization of the physical rather than deferring to science. One response of this sort involves characterizing the phys- ical as the class of entities that are, in relevant respects, similar to paradigmatically physical entities, such as rocks and trees (Snowdon 1989, Stoljar 2001). Such a characterization involves no reference to physical theory, and thus avoids both horns of Hempel\u2019s dilemma.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
