{"paragraph": " To address Reid\u2019s criticism, we might revise the Lockean theory so that it does not require direct connections of memory between two individuals in order for them to be identical. Rather, what matters is that we have continuity of memory between them, or overlapping chains of memory between them. When RG remembers something that AO experienced and AO remembers something that YB expe- rienced, there is continuity of memory between RG and AO even if there are no direct memory connections between them. But even the revised memory theory faces problems. For example, some have worried that the notion of memory presupposes personal identity, and thus cannot explain it (Butler 1736; for a response see Perry 1975). Take a case where you recount an incident in which you told a par- ticularly funny joke. Were we to discover that someone else other than you was the one who told the joke, we would deny that you really remember the incident that you recounted; rather, you only seem to remember it. If you weren\u2019t the one who told the joke, then you can\u2019t have a genuine memory of having done so. But this suggests that facts about memory depend on facts about personal identity. So, it would then be circular to claim that facts about personal identity depend on facts about memory. With worries like this in mind, in contemporary times many \u00adphilosophers have broadened the theory to consider other kinds of psychological connections over and above memory. We are connected to our future selves by means of intentions, for example. My current self forms an intention to go to the store, and then my future self acts PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 244 on that intention. And we also have continuing psychological con- nections in virtue of our desires, beliefs, habits, and other personality traits. Thus, the psychological theory claims that B is the same person as A if and only if there is psychological continuity between B and A.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
