{"paragraph": " Puzzles about minds and persons have an existential pull that is sometimes missing from abstract philosophy. General Introduction 2 There are many ways to dive into the philosophy of mind. You could study the history of theories about the mind or read biographies of the major contributors to the discipline. There\u2019s nothing wrong with those approaches; but we find it much more compelling to start with a set of puzzles or problems. A good philosophical puzzle focuses on a concept or thought we tend to take for granted and shows that, on closer observation, it might not be as coherent or straightforward as it first seemed. Sometimes the puzzle begins with a thought experiment: a situation conjured up in imagination; other times it begins with what we learn from science, and still other times it begins with drawing out consequences of apparently unrelated commonsense. Whichever way it proceeds, if the puzzle is good, we will likely find ourselves troubled by what before seemed unproblematic. It\u2019s from this seed that some of the most promising theories bloom. In this book we consider 50 such puzzles, divided into five \u00adsections. The puzzles in Part I concern mind\u2013body dualism, the nature of \u00adconsciousness, and the relationship between consciousness and the physical world. Those in Part II concern physicalist theories, \u00adaccording to which mentality is a physical phenomenon, such as a brain state. Those in Part III concern mental content, thought, and how the mind represents things. The puzzles in Part IV concern \u00adperception, \u00adimagination, and attention, and those in Part V concern the self and personal identity over time. Although we have tried to keep each chap- ter relatively self-contained, so that they can be read independently of the others, at the start of each section we provide a brief introduction to the general issues raised therein. For those who wish to pursue the topics further, each chapter includes a bibliographic guide to \u00adcanonical presentations, overview articles, and other \u00adimportant contributions to the area.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
