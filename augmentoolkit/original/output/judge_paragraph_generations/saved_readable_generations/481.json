Oxford: Oxford University Press. 26 THE SLEEPY STUDENT (PROBLEM OF STORED BELIEFS) Background: There are three important distinctions when it comes to beliefs that it can be helpful to make clear. First, there are what are often called \u201coccurrent beliefs\u201d. These are beliefs that are present before your conscious- ness, i.e. you\u2019re thinking about them right now. For instance, think about your belief that Canada is north of the United States. Right now, the belief \u201cCanada is north of the United States\u201d is occurrent for you. Second, there are \u201cdispositional beliefs\u201d. These are beliefs that you have stored in memory. For instance, before you started consciously thinking about the fact that Canada is north of the United States, it\u2019s plausible that you already believed it. This belief was stored in your memory, and in fact it still is. Any belief that you have in memory is dispositional. Some of them are occurrent, such as your belief that Canada is north of the United States, when you are thinking about them, and others are dispositional but non-occurrent (they are stored in memory, but you aren\u2019t currently thinking about them). The third distinction isn\u2019t really a kind of belief, but it is definitely related to beliefs. It is the \u201cdisposition to believe\u201d something. For example, right now (prior to looking) you have a disposition to believe that there is a car parked outside. You don\u2019t currently believe this, but were you to look out the window (and see a car, of course) you would form the belief. So, you are disposed to believe this given the right stimulus.
