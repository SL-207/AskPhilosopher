{"paragraph": " J. L. Mackie (1974) and Penelope Mackie (1998) instead appeal to a branching-times model of necessity. On that model, they argue, the only possibilities concerning t itself, rather than a distinct (even if similar) table, emerge only after t is produced from b. And Guy Rohrbaugh and Louis deR- osset (2004) show how one could derive the essentiality of origins principle from a principle concerning the sorts of factors that could prevent the production of a particular material object from a particu- lar hunk of raw material. Such factors, they argue, must be local. In the case of table t and block b, such factors would have to affect b or other elements of the process by which t actually emerged (e.g., the tools, the artisan, etc.). The scenario in which t does not originate from b would, Rohrbaugh and deRosset argue, violate the latter principle. Likewise, they suggest, for a scenario in which the Queen does not originate from g. None of those arguments have gone unchallenged. Thus, whether the Queen could have existed without having origi- nated from g\u2014and, likewise, whether our own biological origins are essential to us as persons\u2014remains unresolved.
