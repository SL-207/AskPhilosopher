{"paragraph": " Although the state of affairs consisting of my now being sorry that it is raining in Miami does not in fact obtain, it still has being as an in\u00ad tentional object for me. Similarly, the state of affairs consisting of some Mongolian's now being pleased that the sun is shining in Ulan Bator, re\u00ad gardless of whether it obtains, still has being as an intentional object for me.4 Anything that is an intentional object for someone, whether it be a thing, an event, or a state of affairs, and regardless of whether it exists, occurs, or obtains, can be considered by the person for whom it is such an object as a part of some whole, the other part of which might also be, but need not be, only an intentional object for that person. 50 The Nature of Value Whether, however, the existence, occurrence, or obtaining of something that is an intentional object for someone would be good, bad or neither good nor bad depends upon the nature of the object, regardless of whether the latter be merely an intentional object or instead also have being independently of its being such an object for anyone. The number of objects and the number of different combinations of such objects of which a person can think is limited only by the extent of his imagina\u00ad tion. Whether one would be pleased, sorry, or neither pleased nor sorry if such objects were to exist, occur, or obtain would depend, at least in part, upon one's likes and dislikes. Whether, however, the existence, oc\u00ad currence, or obtaining of such objects would be good, bad, or neither would depend upon the nature of the objects themselves. Just as anything that is an intentional object for some person can be considered by him to be a part of some whole that is also an intentional object for him, so also anything that does in fact exist, occur, or obtain can be considered to be a part of some whole, the other parts of which are other things, events, or states of affairs that also in fact exist, occur, or obtain.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
