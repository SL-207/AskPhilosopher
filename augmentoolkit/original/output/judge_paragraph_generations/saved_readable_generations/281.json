DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-50 SPLIT BRAINS AND THE UNITY\u00a0PUZZLE BACKGROUND The brains of all mammals are divided into two hemispheres. In pla- cental mammals (as opposed to egg-laying mammals like monotremes or pouch-rearing mammals like marsupials), the hemispheres are \u00adconnected via a brain structure known as the corpus callosum\u2014a wide, C-shaped tract of nerve fibers approximately 10 centimeters long. In 1952, scientists performed an operation on a cat that \u00adsevered the corpus callosum, and thus prevented communication between the two brain hemispheres. The cat\u2019s optic chiasm (the part of the brain where the optic nerves cross) was also severed, so that visual infor- mation provided directly to one of the cat\u2019s eyes went only to the corresponding brain hemisphere. Study of the split-brain cat showed that its two brain hemispheres could function independently of one another. For example, the cat was successfully taught a particular \u00adstimulus\u2013response task via only one eye. When that eye was covered and the same task was presented to the cat via the other eye, it could no longer complete the task. In the early 1960s, subsequent stud- ies with monkeys revealed similar results.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
