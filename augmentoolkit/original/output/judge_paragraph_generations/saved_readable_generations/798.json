{"paragraph": " If it is, then we ought to be rational. If it is not, then, since being moral has greater value than being rational, we ought not to be rational. It would be good if there were never any conflict between the two, so that every morally right act is also a rational act and every rational act a morally right act. But if conflicts between acting morally and acting rationally ever do occur, and they do sometimes seem to occur, we ought always to sacrifice acting rationally for the sake of acting morally. If, therefore, we ask ourselves the question 'What, after all has been said and done, is so important about being rational?' we must answer that it is not very important at all when we compare the value of being rational with the value of being moral: It can be good to be rational only if our being rational does not prevent us from being moral.\" Such a position, since it places greater value on being moral than on being rational, may be labeled the \"moralist\" position. The other posi\u00ad tion, since it places greater value on acting rationally than on acting morally, may be labeled the \"rationalist\" position. For the moralist we are justified in acting rationally only if doing so is compatible with acting rightly. For the rationalist we are justified in acting rightly only if doing so is compatible with acting rationally. Each position, however, assumes an egoistic view of rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality. It is because of this that for each position what seem to be con\u00ad flicts between acting rationally and acting morally, between being rational and being moral, can and do occur. As these positions were characterized above, however, such conflicts cause less distress for the moralist than for the rationalist. This is because the moralist, in openly and unequivocally proclaiming that morality has greater value than rationality, is under less pressure to resolve such conflicts by attempting to show that they are only apparent and not real.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
