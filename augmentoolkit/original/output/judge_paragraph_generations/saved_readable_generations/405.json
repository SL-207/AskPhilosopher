{"paragraph": " Contextualism offers yet another response to this form of skepticism (see Going to the Bank pp. 48\u201352) (DeRose 1995, 2009, Lewis 1996, Co- hen 1999). The contextualist claims that in ordinary contexts, it\u2019s true to say \u201cS knows about the world around her\u201d because the stakes are low (the reason for this is that skeptical alternatives aren\u2019t salient). It is also true to say \u201cS doesn\u2019t know about the world around her\u201d when you are in a skeptical context (i.e., a context where skeptical possibilities, such as that you are deceived by a demon, are made salient). On this response, the skeptical argument is invalid because it fails to take account of the differences between ordinary and skeptical contexts. Another response is to meet the skeptic head-on and argue that your experiences actually do give you reasons to think that you aren\u2019t deceived by a demon and deny premise (1) on those grounds. One of the more popular ways of developing this response is to argue that your normal view of the world is the best explanation of your expe- riences being as they are (Vogel 1990, McCain 2014). Since this best explanation is considerably better than skeptical rivals, such as that you are deceived by a demon, you have sufficient grounds for thinking that you aren\u2019t deceived by a demon. Yet another response is to adopt the Moorean approach (Moore 1939). The Moorean responds to this situation in roughly the follow- ing way. It\u2019s obvious that you know things about the world around you. This is so obvious, in fact, that you can be more sure that it is CARTESIAN/EXTERNAL WORLD SKEPTICISM 59 correct than you can that the skeptical argument yielded by consid- eration of Descartes\u2019 demon is sound. Hence, the Moorean says that since it is more obvious that you know things about the world around you than it is that the skeptical argument is sound, you should reject the skeptical argument. You don\u2019t need to know what is wrong with the argument; you just know that it is wrong.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
