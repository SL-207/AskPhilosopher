{"paragraph": " And yet I have absolutely no sense of my life as a narrative with form, or indeed as a narrative without form. Absolutely none. (Strawson 2004, p. 433) Other critics of the narrative view claim that it\u2019s fairly rare that indi- viduals engage in the kind of sustained self-reflection that would count as organizing one\u2019s life in a narrative way. According to those critics, though we might have moments where we take an introspective turn, we rarely take the time to pause and take up the project of giving our PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 306 lives some kind of overall form and coherence (Vice 2003). Such claims challenge versions of the narrative view that are intended to apply to all or most persons. But whether all narrative views have that ambition is not entirely clear. Nor is it entirely clear that the truth of the narrative view requires it to be the case that all or most people consciously and deliberately construct their own narratives. But what the narrative view looks like in light of those responses is also less than entirely clear. RECOMMENDED READING CANONICAL PRESENTATIONS Mills, Charles. 1998. \u201cBut What Are You Really?
