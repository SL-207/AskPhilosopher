{"paragraph": " Hence, property dualism contends that when it comes to the mind, there is only one substance, the brain, but the brain has both physical and nonphysical properties. Given that this book is an epistemology book, it is natural to wonder why we are discussing this bit of philosophy of mind here. The reason is that one of the main arguments against physicalism (and so for dualism) is what is known as the \u201cKnowledge Argument.\u201d The Knowledge Argument centers around whether or not there is more to be known than merely the physical facts about the universe. One of its key points is the claim that if one knows only physical facts, one\u2019s knowledge is limited in an impor- tant way\u2014this is so even if one knows all the physical facts there are to know. LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 110 EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: THE KNOWLEDGE ARGUMENT; DUALISM VS. PHYSICALISM Mary is a naturally brilliant person, and she has devoted her life to the pursuit of scientific knowledge. In fact, Mary has become one of the premier neuroscientists in the world. And when it comes to her spe- cialty, color vision, no one is even close to as knowledgeable as Mary. She knows all the physical facts about color vision. Mary knows things that other neuroscientists only dream of knowing. When she finally gets around to publishing all that she knows, the study of color vision will be complete. She literally knows all the physical facts there are to know about color vision. So, when it comes to seeing red, say, Mary has the full scientific story. That all said, Mary has had a very peculiar life until now. She has lived her entire life in a black and white room. Everything that she has ever seen in the room around her, her food, her TV, her computer screen, etc. has been black, white, or shades of gray. Mary has never in her life actually seen colors even though she isn\u2019t colorblind; in fact, Mary has no vision problems at all. She knows all about seeing red, but she\u2019s never actually experienced seeing red.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
