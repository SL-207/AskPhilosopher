{"paragraph": " Similarly, some people are morally better in certain respects than others are and morally worse in certain other respects than others are, and some people on the whole are morally better than others are. The class of those, however, who on the whole have a greater quantity of various goods than others have is by no means identical with the class of those who are morally better than others are. At least one, but only one, of the requirements of ideal justice is that as many members as possible of the first class also be members of the second, so that as few as possible of those who on the whole have a greater quan\u00ad tity of various goods than others have are also those who on the whole are morally worse than others are. This is an ideal that has never been realized perfectly in this world, and it is also doubtless an ideal that never will or even can be realized perfectly on earth. From this, how\u00ad ever, it does not follow that we do not have at least a prima f acie duty to try to approach it as closely as we can. If what was said above about the complete good is correct, we do have such a duty. Although the faculty of colleges and universities, like others, have such a duty with respect to the wider community of which they are part, in their role as faculty they have it most immediately with respect to their students. They stand in a relationship to their students in which others do not, and because of this relationship they have a specific duty to their students that others do not have. Their duty is to educate their students, and in their role as faculty it is primarily through fulfilling this duty that they fulfill their duty to the wider community. It is also through fulfilling their duty to educate their students that they fulfill their duty to contribute to the realization of the complete good of the latter. In their role as faculty it is only through fulfilling this duty that they can contribute significantly to the realization of the complete good 206 The Nature of Value of the wider community and to a closer approach to a realization within the wider community of the ideal of justice mentioned above.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
