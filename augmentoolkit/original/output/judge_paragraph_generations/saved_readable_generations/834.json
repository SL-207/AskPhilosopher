{"paragraph": " Stated in a summary way, these answers are: ( 1) that it is good to be indifferent toward them and either bad or indifferent to like or dislike them; (2) that being indifferent toward them is neither good nor bad, liking or disliking them both bad; ( 3) that it is bad to be indifferent toward them; ( 4) that it is good to like them; and ( 5) that it is good to dislike them. The second, third, and fifth answers seem to have little or no plausibility. And although the first and fourth answers do seem to have some plausibility, they both suffer from being extreme answers to our question. As such, they both hold that it is good to take the same attitude toward any and all of the indifferent things of which we have experience or knowledge-the first that it is good to be indifferent toward them all, the fourth that it is good to like them all. It is because of this that neither, despite its plausibility, seems finally to be satisfactory. If, however, it is because of this that neither is ultimately satisfactory, then it is good to take different attitudes toward different indifferent things or kinds of things-to be indifferent toward some, to like others, and perhaps also to dislike still others. This is the view espoused by those who give what I have termed a \"moderate\" answer to our question. 3. Moderate Views of Attitudes toward the Indifferent Such an answer is more congenial than any of the extreme answers to various of the attitudes we do in fact take toward various of the indif\u00ad ferent things of which we have experience or knowledge, since we do in fact like some, dislike others, and remain indifferent to still others. If it were good to be indifferent toward them all and bad or indifferent to like or dislike any, or if it were good to like them all and bad to dislike or to be indifferent toward any, then many of our attitudes toward them would be bad or at least indifferent, given that we do like or dislike some and are indifferent toward others.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
