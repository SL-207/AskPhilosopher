{"paragraph": " From this, however, it does not follow that it is bad that human beings cannot be sweet and that none ever are. Nor does it follow that human beings are bad because they are not sweet. If the preceding is correct, then the fact that particulars of one kind can exemplify certain universals that particulars of another kind cannot exemplify does not entail either ( 1) that it is bad that the latter cannot and do not exemplify these universals or (2) that they are bad because 94 The Nature of Value they cannot and do not do so. If this were entailed, then it would be bad that ice cream cones cannot be kind and bad that human beings cannot be sweet. Gargoyles but not human beings can be made of stone, but only someone as despondent as Quasimodo was over the fact that the lovely Esmeralda could not love someone as ugly as he in the way he loved her could lament the fact that he, unlike a gargoyle, was not made of stone. In order, then, that a particular be a good instance of its kind it is necessary only that it exemplify certain universals that instances of its kind are capable of exemplifying. It is not necessary that it be capable of exemplifying each universal tfiat instances of every other kind are capable of exemplifying. If it were, then no particular of any kind could be a good instance of its kind. From this it follows that the good-making properties of a kind vary from kind to kind, depending upon the nature of the kind, and that a given property can be a good\u00ad making property of a given kind only if instances of the kind in question can have the property in question. 2. Normality and Value In many cases, the properties we regard as good-making properties of a given kind are properties that instances of the kind usually or nor\u00ad mally have. Thus sweetness is regarded as a good-making property of ice cream but not of beer at least in part because ice cream is normally sweet and beer is not.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
