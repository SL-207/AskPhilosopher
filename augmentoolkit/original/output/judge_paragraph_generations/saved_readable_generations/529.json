{"paragraph": " This doesn\u2019t mean however that such views are entirely anti-evidentialist. It is possible for these views to be constructed in ways that are weakly evidentialist. For example, one might be a contextualist and yet maintain that evidence is what provides justification. Hence, one might think that evidence is what justifies, but whether it is correct to attribute knowledge or justified belief to someone depends both upon the evidence the person has and upon the context in which the attributor finds herself. Similarly, one might accept pragmatic encroachment and also accept that only evidence justifies. The thought here is that evidence is the only thing that provides justification, but one\u2019s pragmatic concerns affect how much ev- idence is required for knowledge or for believing to be justified. Interestingly, both of these \u201cimpure\u201d versions of evidentialism hold that it is the stakes for the person (either the believer or the attributor of knowledge/justification) that matter. However, some argue that the stakes for others also affect what is\u00a0justified. MORAL ENCROACHMENT 187 EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: MORAL ENCROACHMENT Karen has been a server at a local restaurant for a couple of years now. During that time, she has developed the impression that people from a particular minority group tend to be bad tippers\u2014on average they leave much lower tips than other groups of people. Karen decides to research her impression to see if there is evidence for this or if she has just formed a mistaken impression. After diligently searching the internet and consulting reliable studies about this, Karen discovers that there is strong evidence that people from this particular minority group on average tip less than people from other groups. In fact, ac- cording to the research, the odds that people from this group will tip lower than average are around 80\u201395%. One day after her research has been conducted, Karen is working at the restaurant.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
