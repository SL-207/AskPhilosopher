{"paragraph": " Indeed, a necessary condition of there being more than one such system is that at least some of the requirements of one system conflict with some of those of any other system. This is the case because if all the requirements of one system were identical with all those of another system, we should have only one system rather than two. A necessary condition, however, of any moral system's being non-egoistic is that it require either ( 1) that we do certain things, such as keeping promises, regardless of whether anyone's interests are thereby promoted or (2) that we act compatibly with \u00b7the promotion of at least some of the interests of at least some of the people affected by our acts and omissions, regardless of whether our doing so is compatible with the promotion of various of our own inter- Morality and Rationality 155 ests, and even regardless of whether in certain cases our doing so requires us to sacrifice certain of our own interests. The preceding characterization of non-egoistic moral systems makes the task of the rationalist most difficult indeed, if not in fact hopeless. What he must show is that the requirements of any acceptable non\u00ad egoistic moral system are such that each person can succeed in pro\u00ad moting his long-term interests if and only if, and only to the degree that, he acts in accordance with these requirements. Since, however, the re\u00ad quirements of such a system are such that from time to time conflicts can arise between complying with them and promoting certain of one's own interests, a high level of moral luck, indeed an impossibly high level of such luck, is required if each person is to avoid such conflicts in any sit\u00ad uation in which he might find himself. Although the rationalist can admit that it is abstractly possible that such conflicts occur, he must nonetheless insist that in actuality each person can unfailingly avoid them. Such insistence is necessary because each person can in fact al\u00ad ways succeed both in promoting his own long-term interests and in complying with the requirements of an acceptable non-egoistic moral system only if such conflicts can always be avoided.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
