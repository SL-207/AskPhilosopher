{"paragraph": " Nous 44: 10\u201331. 49 PREFACE PARADOX Background: There is another paradox that is similar to the lottery paradox discussed in the previous entry. One of the things that makes this paradox seem importantly different is that it doesn\u2019t rely upon probabilistic evidence. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: PREFACE PARADOX Sharon is a very careful scholar, and she has recently finished a metic- ulously researched book. Since the book is finished, she\u2019s putting the final touches on it. The last thing she has to write before sending the book in to her publisher is the preface, which she has almost com- pleted. As she is concluding the preface, Sharon decides to include a statement that is typical of prefaces, and that expresses her genuine humility. Sharon acknowledges that: while I have done my utmost to carefully vet every claim made in this book, I am only human. So, surely there are errors that remain. Any such error is, of course, a failing on my part\u2014not on the part of any of the many excel- lent colleagues who provided helpful feedback as I completed this project. Sharon\u2019s remark at the end of the preface to her book is quite typical of academic books. It is very common for authors to remark that despite their best efforts, there are certainly errors remaining in their Preface Paradox 245 books. Not only is this commonplace, it seems to be something that any reasonable author would accept (even if not all authors explicitly acknowledge the point in their prefaces). Although such admissions are common and seem correct, they\u2019re also quite puzzling. In fact, they seem to suggest that authors tend to have inconsistent sets of beliefs. After all, Sharon believes every claim in her book\u2014why would she make the claims if she didn\u2019t think they were true? In other words, she believes claim 1, claim 2, and so on. Importantly, because of her careful research, Sharon rationally/justifiedly believes each of these claims.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
