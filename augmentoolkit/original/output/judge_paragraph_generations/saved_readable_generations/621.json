{"paragraph": " Rather than being reducible to the con\u00ad cept of belief, the concept of a state of affairs is the concept of some\u00ad thing the obtaining or the non-obtaining of which can be the content of a belief. The content of a belief is also a proposition. From this, how\u00ad ever, it does not follow that states of affairs and propositions are iden\u00ad tical, since, as we shall see, a proposition is the content of a belief in a different sense from that in which the obtaining or the non-obtaining of a state of affairs is. That a given state of affairs obtains, however, is a proposition. We must therefore distinguish between (1) states of affairs, (2) the obtaining and the non-obtaining of a state of affairs, and (3) that a given state of affairs obtains ( or does not obtain), which is a propositon. States of affairs can be entertained as intended objects of thought but cannot be believed. They obtain or do not obtain, but are distinct from and are not reducible to their obtaining or their not obtaining. If this were not the case, one could not entertain as an object of thought some state of affairs, such as the Eiffel Tower's being in London, without con\u00ad sidering also the question of whether it does or does not obtain. More\u00ad over, in order to consider this latter questions it is necessary first to have as the intended object of one's thought the state of affairs the obtaining or the non-obtaining of which one is to consider. One must first think of a state of affairs before one can think of it as obtaining or as not obtaining. In addition, without states of affairs there would be nothing to obtain or not to obtain, and no proposition could be either true or false. The obtaining of a given state of affairs, like the state of affairs that obtains, is neither true nor false, whereas the proposition that a given state of affairs obtains is true or false. But although the two are not identical, they are necessarily related.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
