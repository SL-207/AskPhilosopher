{"paragraph": " Externalism is interesting in itself. But it also might have significant implications for several philosophical issues, including mental causation, self-knowledge, and the mind\u2013body problem, among others. Regarding mental causation: beliefs and desires, including those whose contents Burge\u2019s arguments concern, are commonly thought to play important roles in the causal explanation of action (see Chapter 12). But some ar- gue that such causal explanations should appeal only to internal features of an individual. Environmental features would then seem to be irrele- vant (Stich 1983, Pereboom 1995; but see Burge 1993, Dretske 1988). Regarding self-knowledge (see Chapter 47): if externalism is true, then how can we know the contents of our own beliefs and desires (Burge 1993)? For example, how does Amari know her belief contents concern water rather than twin-water? And, regarding the mind\u2013body problem: some argue that externalism challenges important theories about the mental\u2013physical relationship, such as the mind\u2013brain identity theory. That is because, on that theory, mental states are construed as brain states, which are themselves understood as intrinsic features of individ- uals (Baker 1987; but see MacDonald 1990). And some argue that ex- ternalism has strong implications for widely discussed arguments against physicalism, such as the knowledge argument (Ball 2009, Tye 2009; but see Alter 2013 and Chapter 6).
