This is why it is correct to say that Gilbert can recognize the three-speckled hen as having three speckles but can\u2019t recognize the 48-speckled hen as having 48 speckles. Another sort of response involves arguing that one can be directly acquainted with a determinable property without being directly ac- quainted with the underlying determinate property (Fumerton 2009). \u201cRed\u201d is an example of a determinable property, whereas \u201ccrimson\u201d is an example of a determinate property. So, for example, a shirt has the determinable property of being red because it has the determinate property of being a particular shade of red\u2014crimson. In the case of the hens, the idea is that Gilbert might be directly acquainted with the second hen being many speckled without being directly acquainted with its being 48-speckled. This lack of acquaintance with the hen being 48-speckled explains why Gilbert isn\u2019t justified in believing that the hen looks 48-speckled. Alternatively, a different response says that Gilbert is directly ac- quainted with the hen looking 48-speckled, but insists that he isn\u2019t directly acquainted with the correspondence between the hen looking this way and the thought that the hen is 48-speckled (Fumerton 2009). Again, on the classical foundationalist picture, this would mean that Gilbert isn\u2019t justified in believing that the hen looks to be 48-speckled. When it comes to moderate foundationalism, one response is to in- sist that in order to have justification of this sort, one has to be justified SPECKLED HEN PROBLEM 151 in believing that 48-speckled hens look a certain way, but Gilbert isn\u2019t justified in this looks proposition (McGrath 2018). The general idea here is that in order to be justified in believing that something is an F, based on a visual experience, one has to be justified in believing that Fs look like this\u2014without justification for this looks proposition, one can\u2019t have justification for thinking that something is an F just because one has a particular visual experience.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
