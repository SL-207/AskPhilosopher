{"paragraph": " Most students attend colleges and universities to prepare themselves to pursue a vocation that will enable them to earn more money over the course of their lives than they would probably otherwise be able to do. There is nothing especially bad about this, given that we do need busi\u00ad nessmen, engineers, nurses, teachers, lawyers, and physicians. Were it The Complete Human Good and Higher Education 201 not for this economic interest of students and the fact that colleges and universities attempt to satisfy it, enrollments would be considerably smaller than in fact they are. The number of students who enroll in col\u00ad leges and universities primarily to obtain a liberal education that will enable them to increase their understanding of various aspects of God, man, and the world and their relationship to one another is quite small in comparison to the number who enroll mainly for vocational pur\u00ad poses, and those who enroll primarily for the latter purposes frequently wonder why and complain that they are required to take a certain number of courses in the liberal arts and sciences. I take it that the main reason is that faculty place some value on their students increasing their understanding of various aspects of God, man, and/or the world. Despite what is sometimes said by partisans of the liberal arts and sci\u00ad ences, it is possible for a person to be a good businessman, engineer, nurse, lawyer, or physician without having much knowledge of the var\u00ad ious liberal arts and sciences beyond what is necessary to enable him to complete his course of vocational education. Engineers, for example, need to know some mathematics and physics, physicians some chem\u00ad istry and biology, and students preparing themselves for careers as engi\u00ad neers or physicians usually see the point of requiring them to study such subjects. A person engaged, however, in vocations of the sorts indicated can be quite skilled in that vocation without having any knowledge of the liberal arts and sciences beyond what is necessary to achieve profes\u00ad sional competence.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
