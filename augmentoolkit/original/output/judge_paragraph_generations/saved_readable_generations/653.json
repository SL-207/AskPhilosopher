{"paragraph": " It can have extrinsic value only if killing him or, more properly, his death at the time in question either ( 1) has intrinsic value, 40 The Nature of Value whether positive or negative, or (2) has extrinsic value as a means to some further end that has intrinsic value. As the preceding suggests, in order that something, x, have extrinsic value it is not necessary that it stand in an immediate relation to some\u00ad thing else that has intrinsic value. Thus x has extrinsic value if it is a means of producing y, which itself has no intrinsic value but has extrinsic value as a means of producing something else, z, which does have intrinsic value. In such a situation x stands in an immediate rela\u00ad tion to y, which in turn stands in an immediate relation to z. The rela\u00ad tion of x to z is mediate rather than immediate because it is mediated by the immediate relations of x to y and of y to z. In the case in question, x and y are both instrumental in the production of z, which has intrinsic value, and because of this x and y have extrinsic value regardless of whether they also have intrinsic value. If, however, z itself has no intrinsic value, x and y would still have utility or be useful as means of producing z even though they would then have no extrinsic value by virtue of their relation to z. They might, however, have such value by virtue of their relation to something other than z that does have intrinsic value. As was indicated above, extrinsic value, unlike intrinsic value, is relative, not absolute. Thus one and the same thing, a, can have extrinsic value by virtue of its relation to a second thing, b, but not by virtue of its relation to a third thing, c. It has extrinsic value in relation to b but not in relation to c. Similar considerations apply to utility. It too is relational, not absolute. Thus a can have utility or be useful as a means of producing b but not as a means of producing c.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
