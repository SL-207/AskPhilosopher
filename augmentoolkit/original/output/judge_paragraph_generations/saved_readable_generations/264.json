{"paragraph": " Assuming that the participants want to vote with their own self-interests in mind, how should A vote? How would you vote if you were A? Remember your answer. Case 2. Imagine that an evil scientist kidnaps you and imprisons you in their secret lair. The scientist tells you that he is going to subject you to painful torture. Naturally, you feel scared. Now the scientist tells you that, when the time comes for the torture to start, something will happen to make you forget ever having been told about the torture. This probably doesn\u2019t make you feel any better; it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the torture is going to happen. But now the scientist tells PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 256 you that your forgetting the torture will actually be part of a more dramatic memory change: At the moment of the torture you will have lost all of your memories and all of your mental content. Furthermore, you will somehow acquire an entirely new and different set of mem- ories and mental content. Does any of this make you feel any better, or are you still just as fearful of the torture? Remember your answer here too. By putting these two cases together, Williams can now motivate his puzzle. The key point is that Case 2 is really just one side of the scenario of Case 1, just differently presented. Recall your answer to the question asked at the end of Case 1. When hearing the thought experiment, many people think that A should vote for the B-body to get the money. Since A\u2019s memories will be in the B-body, it seems plausible that the B-body person is really A. A might feel sad that the A-body gets tortured, perhaps because of a sentimental attachment to their former body, but A won\u2019t regard the A-body as who (or where) they are. But now recall your answer to the question asked at the end of Case 2. Many people report that they would still fear the torture, that they would still be inclined to think that it was happening to them, even when they know that the person being tortured won\u2019t have any of their memories and, more generally, mental content\u2014and in fact their mental content will be completely different.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
