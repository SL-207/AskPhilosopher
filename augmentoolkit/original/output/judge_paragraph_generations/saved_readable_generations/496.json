{"paragraph": " What\u2019s the problem? Well, it seems that Gilbert\u2019s visual experience presents him with the image of a three-\u00ad speckled hen when he looks at the first hen and with a 48-speckled hen when he looks at the second. However intuitively, when it comes to what Gilbert is justified in believing, it seems that while he is jus- tified in believing that it looks like the first hen has three speckles, he isn\u2019t justified in believing that it looks like the other hen has 48 speckles. But how can the classical foundationalist account for this difference? Similarly, it seems that Gilbert is justified in believing that the first hen has three speckles but not that the other has 48 speckles. How can the moderate foundationalist account for this difference? RESPONSES As we noted, the speckled hen problem is most widely posed as a problem for classical foundationalism. Consequently, it isn\u2019t surpris- ing that some respond to it by arguing that it shows that classical JUSTIFICATION 150 foundationalism is mistaken. In particular, externalist versions of mod- erate foundationalism appear to have an easy time with this sort of case. Why is Gilbert justified in believing that the hen with three speckles has three speckles but not that the other hen has 48 speckles? Externalists claim that the answer is that Gilbert is reliable when it comes to forming beliefs about three speckles when looking and not reliable when it comes to similar beliefs about 48 speckles. That said, internalists (both classical foundationalists and moderate foundation- alists) have put forward a number of responses to the problem that don\u2019t appeal to reliability. One response claims that the difference when it comes to Gilbert\u2019s justification in this case results from the fact that he has a phenomenal concept of looking three-speckled but lacks such a concept when it comes to looking 48-speckled (see Mary Sees an Apple pp.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
