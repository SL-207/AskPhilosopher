{"paragraph": " Since, however, a state of affairs that obtains is a fact in the first sense of the term, to say of a given state of affairs that obtains that it is good that it obtains is to say of a given fact that it is good that it is a fact. Similar considerations apply to the obtaining and the non-obtaining of states of affairs. Rather than saying that the obtaining of the state of affairs consisting of John's being honest is good, we can say instead either ( 1) \"It is good that John is honest\" or (2) \"That John is honest is good\". These two ways of speaking, however, do not distinguish between ( 1) the state of affairs consisting of John's being honest and ( 2) the obtaining of this state of affairs. Because of this, neither way of speaking is an adequate substitute for either ( 1) \"The state of affairs consisting of John's being honest, which obtains, is good\" or (2) \"The obtaining of the state of affairs consisting of John's being honest is Ontological Categories and Bearers of Value 23 good\". Since there is in fact a difference between ( 1) a state of affairs that obtains, since it is possible that precisely the same state of affairs not obtain ( unless, of course, it is a necessary state of affairs), and (2) its obtaining, the more pedantic locutions I have been using cannot be replaced adequately by the more familiar locutions in question. This, however, is not to suggest that in non-philosophical contexts we replace the familiar locutions with the pedantic ones, since in non-philosoph\u00ad ical contexts we rarely, if ever, have any need to distinguish between ( 1) some state of affairs that obtains and (2) the obtaining of that state of affairs. We do, however, in non-philosophical contexts sometimes have occa\u00ad sion for distinguishing between ( 1) some state of affairs that does not obtain and (2) the non-obtaining of that state of affairs. Thus of states of affairs that do not obtain we sometimes say that it would be good or that it would be bad if they obtained.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
