{"paragraph": " If it is really important to Jorge that the bank be open on Saturday, then it is harder for him to have knowledge than if it isn\u2019t important to him. The final response is what is sometimes called \u201cclassical invar- iantism\u201d or \u201cstable invariantism\u201d (Conee 2014). This is the view that \u201cknow\u201d isn\u2019t context-sensitive, and the requirements for knowledge do not change with the raising or lowering of stakes. On this response, if Jorge knows or fails to know in one of the scenarios, then he\u2019s in the same position in the other scenario. Additionally, this response claims that when Sally uses the word \u201cknow\u201d it means exactly the same thing in both contexts\u2014the requirements for correctly attribut- ing knowledge don\u2019t change with the stakes. When it comes to what Sally says in these scenarios, stable invariantists might say that she is simply mistaken in one or the other scenario, or they may claim that she is correct in both but that is simply because in at least one of the scenarios she is speaking loosely, like when, for example, we say that \u201cit\u2019s 3 o\u2019clock\u201d when in fact it\u2019s 3:05.
