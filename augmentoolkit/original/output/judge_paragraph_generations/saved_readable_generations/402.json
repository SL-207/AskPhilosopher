EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: CARTESIAN/ EXTERNAL WORLD SKEPTICISM Think about some of the things you know about the world around you. You\u2019re reading this book. Perhaps you\u2019re sitting in a chair. You have hands. And so on. Why do you believe these things? Presumably, you believe them on the basis of your experiences. You believe that you\u2019re reading this book, for instance, because it looks like you have a book in your hands. It feels like you have a book in your hands. And so on. So far, no problems. But, have your experiences ever led you astray? For example, have you ever thought that you saw something but then as you moved closer realized that it wasn\u2019t what you thought? Or, are you familiar with any perceptual illusions such as the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion: Limits of Knowledge 56 In the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion, the lines appear to be different lengths, but they are actually the same. Our experiences aren\u2019t perfectly reliable, i.e. they sometimes lead us astray. Realization of this fact led Descartes to worry. If our experiences sometimes lead us astray, how can we tell when they are leading us astray and when they\u2019re not? It\u2019s not clear that we can. But, if we can\u2019t tell in general whether our experiences are leading us astray or not, then it seems possible that they always do. Descartes considered the following sort of situation. Imagine that there is a being with god-like powers, and this being has malicious in- tentions. This particular being, a demon, has decided to spend its time and considerable resources tricking you into believing false things about the world around you. If this were the case, could you be tricked into thinking that you\u2019re reading a book when in fact there is no book at all? It seems so. Could you be tricked into thinking that you have hands when in fact you don\u2019t?", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
