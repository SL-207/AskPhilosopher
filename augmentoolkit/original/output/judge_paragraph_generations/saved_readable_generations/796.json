{"paragraph": " On such a view a person could act rationally only by endeav\u00ad oring to bring about something other than the promotion of his own interests, perhaps something such as the promotion of the interests of others, yet he could act rightly if and only if he acts compatibly with the promotion of his own interests. Such a view would seem to have acting rationally and acting rightly confused with one another. This is perhaps because we are more accustomed to thinking of rationality in egoistic terms and of acting rightly in non-egoistic terms. We are more accus\u00ad tomed, that is, to thinking that a person acts rationally only if he acts compatibly with the promotion of his own interests, rightly or morally only if he seeks to bring about something else, such as the promotion of the interests of others. This is perhaps reflected in the fact that we 1 52 The Nature of Value frequently hear the question \"Is it rational to act morally or to be moral?\" but rarely, if ever, hear the question \"Is it moral to act ratio\u00ad nally or to be rational?\" The fact that we frequently hear the first question but rarely, if ever, hear the second indicates, I believe, that those who raise the first ques\u00ad tion but rarely, if ever, raise the second assume that it is more important to act rationally than it is to act morally. If this is true, then since many philosophers have raised the first question and few have raised the second, it would seem that most philosophers think it more important to be rational than to be moral. Perhaps this is only to be expected, given that their prevailing professional concern is with rationality and being rational. If one does place greater value on being rational than on being moral, then one is more likely to be concerned ( 1) to justify acting morally by showing that it is required by, or at least compatible with, acting rationally than (2) to justify being rational by showing that it is required by, or at least compatible with, being moral.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
