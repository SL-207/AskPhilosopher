{"paragraph": " Since, however, they cannot, the task the rationalist sets himself is hopelessly unrealistic. To some it might seem that the position of the rationalist is also inconsistent, since one cannot consistently hold both an egoistic view of rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality. He would, however, be inconsistent only if he took a position somewhat different from the one ascribed to him above. He would, that is, be inconsistent if he held both ( 1) that each person ought always to seek as an end the promotion of his own long-term interests and (2) that each person ought always to seek as an end to comply with the requirements of an acceptable non\u00ad egoistic moral system. Such a position would be inconsistent because the two ends to be sought sometimes conflict, and one cannot continue to seek both once one recognizes that the attainment of one would pre\u00ad clude the attainment of the other. I can, however, consistently ( 1) seek as an end the promotion of my own long-term interests and (2) seek, as a means to the attainment of this end, to comply with the requirements of an acceptable non-egoistic moral system. In this case no conflict between ends occurs because I would have only one end, not two. Instead, the conflict that occurs is between the end I seek and the means I seek in order to attain the end I have set myself. I am mistaken, but not 156 The Nature of Value inconsistent, in thinking that the attainment of my end requires that I employ the means I choose. Given that conflicts do inevitably arise from time to time between promoting one's own long-term interests and complying with the requirements of an acceptable non-egoistic morality, the moderate moralist is confronted with the same difficulty that confronts the ratio\u00ad nalist. This difficulty confronts them both because ( 1) each operates with an egoistic concept of rationality and a non-egoistic concept of morality and (2) each attempts to reconcile the two by showing that one can promote one's own long-term interests only by acting in accordance with the requirements of an acceptable non-egoistic moral system.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
