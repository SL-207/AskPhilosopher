{"paragraph": " 16\u201320). This response in- volves denying that fake barn cases are genuine threats to knowledge and says the same is true in this case. As we saw in our discussion of such cases, there is a sizeable number of epistemologists who deny the intuition that the presence of many fake barns undermines one\u2019s abil- ity to know that the real barn one is looking at is a barn. Additionally, empirical research suggests that nonphilosophers are inclined to deny this as well. This response makes a similar claim here\u2014it insists that the intuition that Liz fails to know is simply a version of the fake barn intuition, and the response denies that intuition. Put simply, this re- sponse claims that the presence of the misleading news stories in Liz\u2019s environment do not undermine her knowledge. There are ways of modifying the case in an attempt to undercut the plausibility of the response that contends that Liz has knowledge, though. These modifications seek to make it even more likely that Liz could\u2019ve gone wrong in what she believes about the candidate\u2019s situation. If any such modification is successful in showing that Liz has a justified true belief without knowledge, the idea that knowledge is sufficient for transmitting knowledge is undermined.
