{"paragraph": " Sometimes, however, rather than being a means to their acquisition it is instead an impediment and is known to be so. Were this not the case there would be less lying and cheating and stealing than in fact there is. Although most people seem to place more value on having goods than on being good, this does not mean that they place no value at all on the latter. Certainly most people want others to act rightly, if for no other reason than that they believe that they themselves will benefit if 204 The Nature of Value others do so act. Frequently people act rightly because they believe that they will be detected and suffer in some way at the hands of others if they do not. And sometimes people want others to believe that they are morally good and endeavor to deceive others into believing that they are, again because they fear that they will suffer at the hands of others if others believe that they are not. In all these cases, however, morality is valued only as a means to some other end and not as an end in itself. Most people, however, do place some intrinsic value, slight though it might be, on morality itself. This happens whenever a person engages in a process of rationalization and attempts to convince himself that some act he wants to perform is not in fact wrong or that some act he does not want to perform is not in fact obligatory. It happens also whenever a person suffers the painful pangs of a guilty conscience because he believes that he has acted wrongly or badly. A person cannot engage in such processes of rationalization or suffer from a guilty conscience unless he believes that acts of certain sorts are right and acts of certain other sorts wrong, regardless of whether he also believes that his omis\u00ad sion of acts of the first type or his performance of acts of the second type might enable him to acquire certain goods he happens to want. That most people place some intrinsic value, however slight, on morality is also shown by the fact that few people like to think of themselves as or to admit to themselves that they are bad persons even though in fact they are.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
