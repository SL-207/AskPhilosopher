{"paragraph": " Whether something, o, has such value is determined entirely by whether those who have experience of it like or dislike it and by whether anyone would do so were he to have experience of it. It would be inherently good if those who have experience of it like it or if anyone would like it were he to have experience of it, inherently bad if those who have experience of it dislike it or if anyone would dislike it were he to have experience of it. Should those who have experience of it neither like nor dislike it and if no one would like or dislike it were he to have experience of it, then it would have no inherent value at all. The subjectivity of inherent value is even more evident in those cases in which one person likes a given object, o, a second dislikes it, and a third neither likes nor dislikes it. Thus if Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all have experience of o, and if Abraham likes it, Isaac dislikes it, and Jacob nei\u00ad ther likes nor dislikes it, o is inherently good relative to or for Abraham, inherently bad relative to Isaac, and neither inherently good nor inher\u00ad ently bad for Jacob. One and the same thing would be at once inher\u00ad ently good, inherently bad, and inherently indifferent if some who have experience of it like it, some dislike it, and some neither like nor dislike it. Even in the case of those things, if there are any, that are such that each person who has experience of them likes them or that are such that any person would like them were he to have experience of them, their 5 6 The Nature of Value inherent goodness would depend completely upon their being liked by those who have experience of them or upon their being such that they would be liked by anyone were he to have experience of them. The uni\u00ad versal inherent goodness of such things, if it may be called such, would depend completely upon the subjective factor of whether they are uni\u00ad versally liked by those who have experience of them or would be liked by all who have experience of them were they to have such experience, not upon the objective nature of such things.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
