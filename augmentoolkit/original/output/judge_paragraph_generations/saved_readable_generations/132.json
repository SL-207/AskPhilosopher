{"paragraph": " They argue that we should instead characterize the physical nega- tively, in terms of what it is not: to be physical is to be not fundamen- tally \u00admental (Spurrett and Papineau 1999, Levine 2001, Montero and \u00adPapineau 2005, Worley 2006, Fiorese 2016; cf. Montero 1999). Such a negative characterization involves no mention of physical theory, and so Hempel\u2019s dilemma is circumvented. Proponents of this approach, known as via negativa physicalism, also argue that such a negative char- acterization is adequate for the purposes of the mind\u2013body problem. However, it is unclear what falls under the description \u201cnot \u00adfundamentally mental.\u201d And that threatens to make claims central to the mind\u2013body debate especially difficult to evaluate. For example, consider a premise of the zombie argument, that a zombie world\u2014a minimal physical/functional duplicate of the actual world but with- out consciousness\u2014is conceivable (see Chapter 7). That premise is controversial as it is. But it seems especially hard to assess if \u201cphysical\u201d means \u201cnot fundamentally mental.\u201d There might be all manner of fea- tures that satisfy that description, perhaps including some that no one has even dreamt of; and perhaps some such features imply that the zombie-world scenario is incoherent. PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 126 Some combine the negative characterization of the physical with a positive one. For example, Wilson\u2019s account, discussed above, fits that description: the positive characterization is expressed by her \u00adcharacterization of the physical in terms of future/ideal physics; and the negative characterization is expressed by her No Fundamental Mentality constraint. This view might seem a reasonable comprise. Still, there remains a concern that, like via negativa physicalism, the proposed characterization of the physical is overly open-ended since, again, we do not know the content of ideal physical theory.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
