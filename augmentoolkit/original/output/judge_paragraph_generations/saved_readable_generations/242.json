{"paragraph": " Campion et al. (1983) argue that in blindsight cases there is reason to believe that the patients are phenomenally conscious of the stimuli, at least to some extent. For one thing, normal subjects show similar behaviors when a stimulus is very dim, near the threshold for detection, suggesting that Blindsight, Distracted Driving, and Pneumatic Drills 233 the blindsight patients might merely have a very dim perception. In addition, blindsight subjects could be responding to light scattered from the \u201cunseen\u201d object to other parts of the retina. Perhaps most seriously, the experiments are plagued by what\u2019s known as response bias. In particular, in blindsight experiments there are two different metrics being used. One is a yes/no question: \u201cAre you aware of anything?\u201d The blindsight patient says \u201cno.\u201d The other is a forced choice in which the patient has to commit to something happening in the visual field: for example, \u201cIs the cursor moving left or right?\u201d The blindsighter often answers this question correctly. The difference between these procedures raises the possibility that the pa- tient is dimly conscious of the stimulus in both cases, but the types of questions prompt the use of different criteria in responding. In the first case there is a conservative bias to deny there is awareness; but in the case when the patient has to commit, they are forced to draw on even the slight conscious signal they have (Phillips 2016). Finally, there is the potential that, in the case of blindsight, there is phenomenal consciousness without access consciousness. To put the point without fully committing to Block\u2019s distinction, we might say that there is phenomenal consciousness without verbal reportability (Phillips 2016). Perhaps there\u2019s something it is like for the blindsighter when they are presented with items that lie in their blindspot, but the problem is that they can\u2019t report on what they\u2019ve seen.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
