{"paragraph": " So, if supporters of the transmission view want to protect their view when it comes to justification, more would need to be done. A different response that some supporters of the transmission view of testimony take is to allow that Mr. Flat\u2019s students really do come to have knowledge from his testimony, but argue that this is because Social Epistemology 172 transmission of knowledge is actually occurring in this case. The thought is that while Mr. Flat doesn\u2019t himself have knowledge, he is connected via earlier testimony to others who do (Faulkner 2000, 2011, Graham 2006). When it comes to his students, Mr. Flat is essen- tially serving as a link between his students and others who do have knowledge of the Earth\u2019s shape. However, some argue that cases like that involving Mr. Flat can be slightly modified so that it still seems that the students come to have knowledge, but with Mr. Flat being the first link in the testimonial chain. This would arise in a case where Mr.\u00a0Flat discovers, on his own, strong evidence for thinking that the Earth is spherical and teaches his students this evidence. A final response to these sorts of cases on behalf of the transmission view of testimony is to argue that what these cases actually show is that the transmission view of testimony should be focused on prop- ositional justification (see General Background: The Nature of Justification pp. 113\u2013119) rather than knowledge or justified beliefs (Wright 2016). The thought here is that in cases like the one above, Mr. Flat isn\u2019t trans- mitting knowledge or justified belief (because he has neither), but he is transmitting propositional justification. He is sharing good reasons to accept that the Earth is spherical that he himself possesses. Hence, this response takes onboard the main claims of those who use this sort of case as an objection to the transmission view of testimony, and then uses these insights to refine the theory rather than abandon it.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
