The chariot and candle cases we consider in this chapter attempt to motivate the no-self view and show how these questions can be answered. 40 PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 248 THE CASES In The Questions of King Milinda, the King meets a monk and asks his name. The monk replies that everyone calls him \u201cNagasena,\u201d but he is careful to note that \u201cNagasena\u201d is just a \u201cconvenient designator, a mere name,\u201d and that in fact there is no person there. There is indeed a collection of parts corresponding to Nagasena\u2014feelings, thoughts, body parts, etc.\u2014but none of these alone is Nagasena; nor are all these things taken as a whole. Naturally, this bewilders King Milinda. It seems to him that he is talking to Nagasena, that Nagasena is speaking, and if there is no Nagasena, no one can be talking to him; nor is there someone to receive alms, which would be too bad for a Buddhist monk. If there is no Nagasena, the claim \u201cNagasena receives alms\u201d is not only false, but arguably meaningless: if the name doesn\u2019t designate anything, it appears to be merely an empty sound. Nagasena replies with an analogy. Both Nagasena and the King agree that the King arrived in a chariot. But the chariot is not the axle, or the wheels, or the yoke, etc. Nor is it all those parts taken as a collection\u2014put all these parts in a bag and you still don\u2019t have a chariot. So, there appears to be no chariot; and, contrary to what the King himself believed, he must not have arrived in a chariot. But, of course, he did, and \u201cchariot\u201d is not just an empty sound. Instead, Nagasena explains, in both the case of the chariot and the person, we use words to designate certain arrangements of parts. But there is no further thing that is the chariot beyond that changeable arrangement of parts, and there is no further thing that is a person or self over and above the changing parts of the body and mind.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
