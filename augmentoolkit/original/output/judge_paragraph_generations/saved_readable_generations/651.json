{"paragraph": " Sometimes, however, when people say that one thing, x, is twice or three times as valuable as another, y, they do not intend to say anything at all about the economic or monetary value of x and y but instead seem to be saying, although they would not or might not use such language, that the intrinsic value of x is twice or three times as great as that of y. This is especially true when a person says, as people sometimes do, that one of his experiences, x, is twice or three times as good as another of his experiences, y. Such language is not misleading if the speaker intends only to say, and is understood by those he addresses as intending only to say, that x is much better than y. It is, however, misleading if the speaker means to say, and is understood as meaning to say, that x liter\u00ad ally is twice or three times as intrinsically valuable as y. The statement that x is twice or three times as valuable as y cannot be true if it is intended to be taken literally. Although one thing or state of affairs can be much more valuable than another, it cannot be twice or three times as valuable. The fundamental reason this is so is that there are no numerical units in terms of which intrinsic value can be measured. This, however, does not mean that there cannot be quantitative differences between the intrinsic value of one thing or state of affairs, x, and that of another, y. One thing or state of affairs, x, can be slightly more valuable or much more valuable than another, y, and the difference between Species of Value 3 9 being slightly more valuable and much more valuable is a quantitative difference. It is not, however, a quantitative difference that can be mea\u00ad sured numerically by using or counting units of intrinsic value, since there are no such units. Thus from the fact that there is a quantitative difference between the degree to which one thing, x, has some property, f, and the degree to which another thing, y, has that property, it does not follow that the difference can be measured numerically.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
