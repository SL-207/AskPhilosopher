{"paragraph": " And, this response claims that it isn\u2019t possible for us to believe this sort of obvious contradiction. Another response to this paradox is to argue that what makes believ- ing a Moorean proposition absurd is that by believing it you thereby Moore\u2019s Paradox 237 make the proposition false (Williams 1994). Here, the idea is that when George forms the belief \u201cit\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d, his forming that belief makes it false. After all, when George forms this belief, he believes that it is raining (that\u2019s the first part of the proposition), but his believing that it\u2019s raining makes the second half of the proposition false. Thus, this response claims that the solution to Moore\u2019s Paradox is to realize that while Moorean propositions might be true, it is absurd to believe them because once you believe the proposition it becomes false. A related way of responding to Moore\u2019s Paradox is to claim that rather than the believing making a Moorean proposition false, you can never be justified in believing a Moorean proposition whether or not it is true (Williams 2004). The thought here is that whatever justifies George in believing that it is raining also justifies him in believing that he believes that it is raining. So, the general idea here is that you can never justifiably believe a Moorean proposition. Either you will have justification for believing p, in which case you will also have justifica- tion for believing that you believe that p. Or you will have justifica- tion for believing that you don\u2019t believe that p, or that you believe that p is false, in which case you will lack justification for believing that p. In either scenario, you fail to have justification for the conjunction that is the Moorean proposition. A final sort of response denies that there is actually a problem with believing Moorean propositions in general. This response insists that there are serious philosophical positions that one might hold that can make believing a Moorean proposition rational (Frances 2016).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
