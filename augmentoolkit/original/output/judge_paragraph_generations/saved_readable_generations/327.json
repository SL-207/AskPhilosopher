{"paragraph": " Epistemic\u2003 Epistemological\u2014that is, concerning knowledge and related phenomena, such as belief and evidence. Epistemology\u2003 The part of philosophy that concerns knowledge and related phenomena, such as belief and evidence. Examples of epistemological (or, equivalently, epistemic) questions include: How can we know anything? What is the nature of knowledge? Is knowledge the same as justified, true belief? Essence\u2003 That which makes something what it is, and that it cannot exist without. For example, on some views the essence of water is its chemical composition, H2O. On this view, the fact that water Glossary 317 is composed of H2O molecules is what makes water what it is. Also, on this view, water cannot exist without being so composed. Extended substance\u2003 An entity that exists in three-dimensional space. Descartes defines \u201cbody\u201d in terms of being extended. Externalism\u2003 The theory that the content of some mental states depends constitutively on features of a subject\u2019s environ- ment. For example, according to this theory, a molecule-for- molecule duplicate of you might have different belief contents if, in their environment, there were no water but instead a substance that looks, feels, and tastes like H2O but has a different chemical composition. Extrinsic feature\u2003 Relational property. For example, that a \u00adbaseball is larger than a table tennis ball is an extrinsic feature of the \u00adbaseball. By contrast, a baseball\u2019s spherical shape is an intrinsic feature of the baseball. See also intrinsic feature. Folk psychology\u2003 The implicit theory behind the way people \u00adordinarily (in everyday life) think of psychological states and psychological categories. For example, according to folk psy- chology, belief and desire are distinct mental states, and beliefs and desires often cause people to act in certain ways\u2014as when my desire to beat an opponent at Scrabble and my belief that playing \u00addefensively will help me win causes me to play defensively.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
