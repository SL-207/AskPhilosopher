{"paragraph": " We should still regard a person with eight fingers on each hand as deformed or malformed even though his having that number of fingers would enable him to be a much better pianist than he would otherwise be. This indicates that we do not regard such a deformity as bad because in some way it incapacitates the person so afflicted. Even though it might enable him to achieve certain excellences he would otherwise be incapable of attaining, we would still regard it as bad. The reason we would do so, I suggest, is that such a deformity would be an abnormality. Such a person's hands would be badly formed, and they would be so because it is not normal to have eight fingers on each hand. Similar considerations apply to the number of arms, legs, eyes, and other bodily parts of a person. Suppose that the parents of a newly born baby acquire as pets a dog and a cat, each born at about the same time as the baby. Six years pass. Neither the dog nor the cat, despite their living within the family, and perhaps even being considered members of it, has learned to speak. This is not a source of sadness for the parents. Suppose also, however, that neither has their child learned to speak. This is a source of sadness for them. They regard it as bad that their child has not learned to speak, but do not regard it as bad that neither the dog nor the cat has learned to do so. They regard the first but not the second state of affairs as bad because it is normal for six-year-old children to be able to speak but not for six-year-old dogs and cats to be able to do so. We grieve when our close friends and relatives die. We also usually regard it as bad that they die. We do not, however, think it is as bad that an eighty-year-old person has died as we do that a child or a young or even middle-aged adult has died. At least part of the reason is that it is 96 The Nature of Value normal for a healthy person, barring accidents, to live to be seventy-five or eighty.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
