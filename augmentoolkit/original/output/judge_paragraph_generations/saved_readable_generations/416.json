{"paragraph": " Various responses have been given to this skeptical challenge. One variety of response attempts to respond to memory skepticism without relying on memory (Hasan forthcoming). The idea behind this general response is to use features of your current perceptual knowledge as evidence of the reliability of memory. For example, you might reason that the best explanation of its seeming to you that you remember something is that you actually remember it. Or, it may be that the best explanation of the apparent sensation you have of successfully predicting that it would seem to you now that you are reading this book is that you remember making that prediction a few moments ago. Another response is to argue that not all forms of circularity are bad (Bergmann 2006). Very roughly, the idea here is that if you don\u2019t have positive reason to mistrust your memory, then there is nothing wrong with using it to establish the reliability of memory. Of course, it seems that in the face of the sort of skeptical challenge that we\u2019re discussing, the response would also have to claim that the mere possibility of the universe being only five minutes old doesn\u2019t give you sufficient reason to mistrust your memory. A final sort of response to this skeptical challenge is to argue that memory skepticism of this sort is self-defeating (Rinard 2019). The general idea here is that this sort of skepticism would commit us to being skeptical of all complex reasoning, but it is irrational to be skep- tical of complex reasoning (\u201ccomplex reasoning\u201d here is understood very broadly\u2014i.e., even a simple argument with a couple of prem- ises counts as complex reasoning in this sense). Simply put, the idea is that if we can\u2019t trust memory, then we cannot trust any complex reasoning. Why? Because we have to rely upon memory to engage in any complex reasoning. But, of course, it\u2019s irrational to be skeptical of complex reasoning because the only way that we could have rea- son to be skeptical of complex reasoning is if we engage in complex reasoning.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
