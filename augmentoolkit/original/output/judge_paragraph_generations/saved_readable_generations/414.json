{"paragraph": " However, the possibility that the universe is only five minutes old seems to cast doubt upon your knowledge of the past. If you can\u2019t be sure that the universe is as old as you think it is, it doesn\u2019t seem that you are in a position to know that what you believe about the past is true. Despite their differences, external world skepticism and skepticism about the past seem structurally similar. In both cases, the problem is that there is a skeptical scenario that seems indistinguisha- ble from how the world actually is, and the possibility of this scenario seems to make it so that you can\u2019t have knowledge of the relevant sort (e.g., knowledge about the world around you or the past). Consideration of this situation may also pose a challenge to whether you can trust your memory. If the universe were only five minutes old, all of your memories from more than five minutes ago would be false. That means that the vast majority of your memories would be false. If you can\u2019t be sure that the universe isn\u2019t only five minutes old, it seems that you can\u2019t be sure that your memories aren\u2019t false. This skepticism about the past may lead you to question whether you can trust your memory at all. After all, even setting aside the worry about the age of the universe, how can you establish that your memory is relia- ble? You may think that you could simply test your memory\u2014think about something that you remember, that there\u2019s a soft drink in the refrigerator, say, and go check; if you\u2019re right, then you have evidence LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 68 that your memory is reliable. Although this seems like a reasonable test, there\u2019s a serious problem\u2014you\u2019d be relying upon your memory the whole time! You have to use your memory to confirm that there being a soft drink in the refrigerator actually matches the memory that you are testing. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem that you can legit- imately use your memory to determine that your memory is reliable.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
