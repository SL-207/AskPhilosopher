{"paragraph": " From this, however, it does not follow that these two concepts are the central con\u00ad cepts of moral philosophy, as distinguished from value theory, which is to say that it does not follow that the central concepts of moral philos\u00ad ophy-such as the concepts of duty or obligation, ought, rightness and wrongness, supererogation, rights, moral goodness and badness, and moral virtues and vices-are all explicable in terms of the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness. In this chapter we turn to treat briefly the relationship of such goodness and badness to such specifically moral concepts. If such moral concepts are explicable in terms of such good\u00ad ness and badness, then moral philosophy is simply a branch of value theory; if they are not, then the former is not simply a branch of the latter. 1. Moral Concepts and Value Concepts In treating the relationship of the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness to specifically moral concepts it is important at the outset not to present definitions of concepts of the latter type that beg the question of w_hether they are explicable in terms of the former pair of concepts. It is therefore important that concepts such as those of duty and right\u00ad ness not be defined in the way in which Moore defines them. According 72 Moral and Non-Moral Value 73 to him, \"Our 'duty' . . . can only be defined as that action, which will cause more good to exist in the Universe than any possible alternative. And what is 'right' or 'morally permissible' only differs from this, as what will not cause less good than any possible alternative.\" 1 It might be the case that in any given concrete existential situation a person's duty is to perform the act that will lead to more good than would any other act open to him in his situation. It might also be the case that in a given concrete situation a person acts rightly only if his act leads to as much good as would any other act open to him in the situation.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
