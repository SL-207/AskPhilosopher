{"paragraph": " What about Sal though? Intui- tively, Sal\u2019s belief that there is a bird flying nearby is also warranted. Sal is looking at the same bird with just as clear a view as Al. Sal\u2019s vision works exactly as well as Al\u2019s, after all he\u2019s Al\u2019s exact molecule for mole- cule duplicate! Here, it seems that proper functionalism faces a problem. Sal was created just moments ago by a random lightning strike. Con- sequently, Sal\u2019s cognitive faculties don\u2019t have a design plan\u2014they were neither designed by a conscious designer nor by the process of natural selection. Since Sal\u2019s cognitive faculties lack a design plan, his belief cannot satisfy proper functionalism\u2019s requirements for warrant. Hence, proper functionalism is committed to Sal\u2019s belief being unwarranted. But, intuitively, Sal\u2019s belief is warranted. After all, how could Al\u2019s belief be warranted and yet Sal, who is a molecule for molecule duplicate of him, not be warranted in holding the same belief when looking at the same thing under the same conditions? RESPONSES As we know, examples don\u2019t have to be realistic in order to be effec- tive when it comes to evaluating epistemological theories, but they do have to be possible. Some have responded to this sort of case by arguing that it isn\u2019t actually possible (Graham 2012). The thought here is that if there were a creature such as Sal he wouldn\u2019t actually have beliefs at all because he would lack the representational content to form them (this is what the earliest form of a swampman example was thought to show in philosophy of mind). Another response is to allow that the example is possible but insist that perhaps there are other ways for a cognitive faculty to meet the design requirement aside from intentional design or the process of natural selection (Plantinga 1991, Graham 2014). Thus, this response is an attempt for proper functionalism to yield the intuitive result that Sal\u2019s belief is warranted just like Al\u2019s by claiming that his faculties count as functioning properly for some reason or other despite lack- ing design.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
