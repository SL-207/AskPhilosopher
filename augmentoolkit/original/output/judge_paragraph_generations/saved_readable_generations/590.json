{"paragraph": " Unfortu- nately, since Ginger was caught completely by surprise, she didn\u2019t get a good look at the bus or the driver. She could tell that it was clearly a bus that hit her, but she was so disoriented that she couldn\u2019t clearly make out whether the bus was black or blue. To make matters worse there were no eyewitnesses or security cameras nearby. However, Ginger learns that there are only two bus companies in town. One has all black buses and the other has all blue buses. And, the company with blue buses is considerably larger than its rival\u201485% of the buses operating in town are owned by this company. TVs: Fred was seen leaving a store with a new TV the same day the store was looted. That day 100 TVs were taken from the store, but only 1 of the 100 was actually purchased. Unfortunately, the TV that was purchased was a cash transaction and the customer left their receipt on the counter. And, as luck would have it there was no security footage showing the purchase being made. When we think about situations like BUSES and TVs puzzles arise. For instance, suppose that Ginger decides to file a lawsuit against the company with the blue buses purely on the grounds that she was hit by a bus, and this company owns 85% of the buses in town. Intui- tively, it doesn\u2019t seem like she should win this lawsuit. However, civil lawsuits like this one only require a preponderance of evidence (i.e. greater than 50% odds that one side is at fault). Similarly, think about Fred. Suppose Fred is picked up by the police and criminal charges are brought against him. The only evidence against Fred is that he left the store with a TV and 99% of the TVs taken from the store that day were stolen. If he were convicted of theft on those grounds and made to pay a stiff fine, it seems a grave injustice would have occurred. Yet, beyond reasonable doubt is typically taken to simply mean 90\u201395% odds that the person is guilty, and the odds that Fred is guilty are even better than that.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
