{"paragraph": " People disagree about politics, religion, philosophy, you name it. Relatively recently, the epistemology of disagreement has become a major topic of discussion. The central concern of this literature is how disagreement affects what is epistemically justified for us. The focus here is on genuine disagreements\u2014where the parties aren\u2019t simply miscommunicating, but instead they are talking about the same thing and hold different views. The simplest sort of disagreement is when one person believes p and another believes not p\u2014such as when one person believes that God exists and another believes that God does not exist. Additionally, it\u2019s not the mere fact that there is a disagreement that is thought to be important. After all, someone might disagree with S about p, but S may be completely oblivious to the fact that anyone disagrees. So, the interesting issues surround recognized disagreement, i.e. situations where one knows that other people disagree. That is to say, the cases that epistemologists are interested in are cases where S believes that p and S learns that someone else doesn\u2019t believe that p (either they believe not p SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY 192 or they suspend judgment, neither believing nor disbelieving p). What should one believe in this sort of case? Of course, there are some kinds of disagreement where the epistemically appropriate response is easy to discern. For example, most everyone agrees that if you find yourself in a disagreement with an expert on a topic on which you are not an expert, you should simply accept what the expert says and give up on your position. Hence, if you go to the doctor (and you\u2019re not a medical expert yourself) and the doctor tells you that you don\u2019t have the flu, even if you thought you had the flu when you went to the doctor, you should believe what the doctor tells you; you don\u2019t have the flu. Similarly, if you find yourself in a disagreement with someone who clearly doesn\u2019t know as much as you, you should simply stick with your own opinion.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
