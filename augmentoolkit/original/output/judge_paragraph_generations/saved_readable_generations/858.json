{"paragraph": " On the other hand, most of us have known simple uneducated people who know little or nothing of any of the arts and sciences who are kind, considerate, honest, and unfailingly fair and just in their dealings with other people. Reflection on our personal knowledge of the aesthetes, scientists, faculty, and simple uneducated people we have known and on our first-hand knowledge of how they treat other people ought by itself alone to convince us that an educated person is not necessarily a good person, that an uneducated person is not necessarily a bad person, and that uneducated people can be and sometimes are better persons than educated people. And while we are engaged in such reflections, let us reflect also on the question of how we ourselves regard and treat the educated and uneducated people we come across in the course of our daily lives. Do we value and respect as persons and treat as kindly and considerately the uneducated people we come across as we do those who are educated? An honest and accurate answer to this question will reveal at least something about our own attitudes toward the value of civilization and that of morality-toward the value of being educated and the value of being morally good. 2. Being Good and Having Goods The preceding suggests that values are divisible into two broad classes-into moral values on the one hand and all other values on the other, which may accordingly be referred to as non-moral values. Included among the latter are certain of the objects of education in the sense of the term in which I have been using it. The objects in question are divisible into two broad categories-those of professional or voca\u00ad tional education on the one hand and those of liberal education on the other. I shall speak first about the former. One of the purposes of higher education is to provide students the education necessary to enable them to pursue some vocation or profes\u00ad sion such as business, engineering, nursing, teaching, law, or medicine.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
