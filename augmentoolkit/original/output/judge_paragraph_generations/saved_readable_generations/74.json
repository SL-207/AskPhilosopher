{"paragraph": " The mental can be subtracted from the universe and nothing about physical events would change. The only hope seems to be for the mental phenomena to overdetermine the physical events\u2014your moving your hand from the burner is fully caused by the physical events, but is also caused, somewhat redun- dantly, by your pain. But that your hand movement should be caused twice over in that way seems implausible. Since it seems implausi- ble that mental events are either causally irrelevant to the physical or causally redundant, the exclusion problem puts serious pressure on PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 72 the claim that mental and physical properties are distinct (Kim 1989, 1998). Unlike the problem Princess Elisabeth raised for Descartes, the ex- clusion problem doesn\u2019t rule out mental causation based on the na- tures of the properties involved\u2014that non-spatial mental things can\u2019t interact with physical things in space. Instead, the exclusion argument turns on an empirical premise often referred to as the completeness of physics: every physical event can be fully explained in physical terms. This leaves the mental with nothing to do. One of the upshots is that the exclusion problem arises not only for the dualist\u2014who thinks the mental is something over and above the physical\u2014but for the non-reductive physicalist as well. Non-\u00adreductive physicalists accept that mental properties are nothing over and above the physical, in the sense that such properties are metaphysically \u00adnecessitated by physical properties; but they deny that the mental properties are identical to those physical properties. For example, the non-reductive physicalist might hold that, while beliefs and all other mental states are nothing over and above brain states, being a belief cannot be identified with any particular physical property. According to non-reductive forms of functionalism, for example, what makes a belief a belief is the role it plays in a cognitive system\u2014it stores infor- mation for use by the system, etc.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
