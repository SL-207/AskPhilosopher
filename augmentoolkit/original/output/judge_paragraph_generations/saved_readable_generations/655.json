{"paragraph": " A second form of extrinsic value is contributory value. To have contributory value is to contribute in some way to the value of some whole of which that which has contributory value is a part. To say that some part of a given whole contributes to the value of the whole is to say that the value of the whole is determined, at least in part, by the nature of the part in question, taken in conjunction with the nature of the whole of which it is a part. Thus what essentially distinguishes contributory value from instrumental value is that anything that has contributory value has such value by virtue of its contributing to the value of some whole of which it is a part, whereas anything that has instrumental value has such value by virtue of its being a means to the existence or occurrence of some\u00ad thing that has intrinsic value but of which it is not a part. Some atten\u00ad tion must therefore be given to the concept of wholes and parts if the concept of contributory value is to be understood adequately. Perhaps the most obvious type of a whole that has parts is a material thing. Husserl distinguishes between two types of parts of material things-independent parts and dependent parts. Independent parts are pieces of the whole of which they are parts; dependent pc:1.rts are moments, aspects, or qualities of the whole of which they are parts. Independent parts or pieces are themselves particulars and would still exist as particulars if they were separated from the wholes of which they 42 The Nature of Value are parts. Dependent parts or moments are not particulars but instead are either universals or singular cases of universals. Whether they are universals or singular cases of universals depends upon whether the qualities ingredient in particulars are themselves universals or singular cases of universals. Husserl regards them, as do I, as being singular cases of universals. So regarded, a moment of one particular, such as its brownness, is unique to it and cannot be a moment of another partic\u00ad ular.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
