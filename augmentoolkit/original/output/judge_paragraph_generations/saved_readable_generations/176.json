{"paragraph": " My thoughts about brains, vats, and other items in the external world are not intrinsically such that they refer to those things. As we saw in Chapter 25, when discussing Twin Earth, some philosophers take the content of our thoughts to be no less beholden to connections with the external world than our language is. On that view, if I am in fact a BiV, and so have had no perceptions of brains or vats, it seems to follow that I cannot even think that I am a brain in a vat. Since I can think that thought, skepticism can be rejected. DISCUSSION Many philosophers have noted that Putnam\u2019s argument does not pro- vide a convincing answer to skepticism (Brueckner 1986), for, even if there are some BiV scenarios in which we couldn\u2019t think or express the hypothesis that we are brains in vats, there are many where we can. Suppose that I was envatted last night. That scenario cannot be ruled out as self-defeating, for, in that case, I would have had contact with brains and vats in the past, and my terms would refer just as they did before I was envatted. Still, even if Putnam\u2019s argument is not suc- cessful, the realization that the contents of what we are thinking and saying might not be the same if we were BiVs is an important one. Many readers will recognize the similarity between the BiV hy- pothesis and the premise of the 1999 film The Matrix. In The Matrix, humans seem to experience the world just as you and I do. They go to work, dance at the club, and eat steak in fancy restaurants. As a CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 170 matter of fact, though, humans have all been inside pods, floating in goo since birth. They are hooked up to \u201cthe Matrix,\u201d which generates a compelling virtual reality. Only a very few realize that they are in fact in the pods and that the world they knew was an illusion. How do we know we\u2019re not in the Matrix ourselves? Since our experi- ences in the Matrix would be indistinguishable from our experiences in the real world, it seems we can\u2019t know.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
