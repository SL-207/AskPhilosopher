{"paragraph": " That said, since externalist theories are often formulated in terms of doxastic justification, we can treat the debate as concerning whether or not there are requirements outside of having particular mental states that determine whether someone justifiedly believes that p, aside from whatever is required to satisfy the basing relation. Now that we have gotten sufficiently clear on the focus of the in- ternalism/externalism debate, let\u2019s take a look at the opposing sides. All versions of internalism are committed to mentalism, and most forms of externalism are committed to the denial of mentalism (for our purposes, we can set aside the complication of getting into the details of externalist views that accept mentalism). Mentalism is the idea that any two individuals that are exactly alike mentally are exactly alike in terms of the propositional justification that they have. In other words, mentalism says that there can\u2019t be a difference in terms of prop- ositional justification without a difference in terms of mental states. So, if Earl and Rich differ in terms of their propositional justification, say Rich is justified in believing that p and Earl isn\u2019t, then there must 119 JUSTIFICATION be some mental difference between Earl and Rich. And assuming that Earl and Rich both satisfy the requirements of the basing relation, internalists insist that it can\u2019t be that one of them justifiedly believes that p, but the other\u2019s belief that p is unjustified unless there is some mental difference between them. Externalism in all of its many vari- eties denies mentalism. In other words, externalist views of epistemic justification contend that Earl and Rich can be mental duplicates, i.e. exactly alike in terms of all of their memories, experiences, ways of thinking, and so on, and both satisfy the conditions necessary for the basing relation, and yet Rich justifiedly believes that p and Earl does\u00a0not.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
