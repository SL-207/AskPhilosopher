{"paragraph": " (In classical systems of logic, every proposition is entailed by a contradiction. So the worry here is that supporters of this response need to give a principled reason for why one can rationally believe a contradiction but not then rationally infer every proposition from the rationally believed contradiction.) A more popular response, which was what Henry Kyburg orig- inally took the lottery paradox to show, is that CONJUNCTION is false (Kyburg 1961, 1970). The idea here is that while Henry can rationally believe that ticket #1 lost, that ticket #2 lost, that ticket #3 lost, and so on, he can\u2019t rationally believe the conjunction of all of these. In other words, Henry cannot rationally believe that \u201cticket #1 and ticket #2 and ticket #3\u2026 and ticket #100 lost\u201d. Proponents of this view often point out that risks add up, and once the risk of being wrong is high enough it is no longer rational to believe. To illustrate this idea, let\u2019s assume that in order for it to be rational to believe that p, it must be that your evidence makes p\u2019s truth higher than 95% (this is just an arbitrary assumption\u2014the point here will be the same for any threshold that we set below 100%). Henry is rational in believ- ing that ticket #1 lost because it is 99% likely that it lost. He is also rational in believing that ticket #2 lost because it is 99% likely that it lost. He is also rational in believing that ticket #3 lost because it is 99% likely that it lost. And so on. However, Henry isn\u2019t justified in believing the conjunction that all of the tickets lost because the little bit of risk that he is wrong about each individual ticket adds up. For PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 242 example, it is 99% likely that ticket #1 lost and 99% likely that ticket #2 lost, but it is only 98.01% likely that both ticket #1 and ticket #2 lost. As we combine more of Henry\u2019s beliefs about the individual tickets together, the more likely it is that he is mistaken.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
