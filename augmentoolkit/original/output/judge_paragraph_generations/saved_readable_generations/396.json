Sarah says, \u201cLet\u2019s just go on home and go to the bank tomorrow. It\u2019ll be open. Jorge told me earlier today that he was there last Saturday, and he knows that it\u2019s open tomorrow.\u201d Sally responds, \u201cOK, since Jorge knows that the bank is open tomorrow, let\u2019s just go home and deposit these checks tomorrow.\u201d And here\u2019s the second scenario: Sally and her sister Sarah are on their way home Friday afternoon and trying to decide whether or not they should swing by the bank. Their grandmother sent them each a check for their birthday, and their bank\u2019s mobile deposit app isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s extremely important to them to have the money in their account before next week. If they don\u2019t get these checks de- posited, they\u2019re not going to be able to pay their rent. However, if they could go the next day\u2014on Saturday\u2014that would be much more convenient than taking the time to go today. Sarah says, \u201cLet\u2019s just go on home and go to the bank tomorrow. It\u2019ll be open. Jorge told me \u00adearlier today that he was there last Saturday, and he knows that it\u2019s open tomorrow.\u201d Sally responds: Are you sure? Jorge might have mixed up which day he was there last week. Plus, it\u2019s possible that the bank changed its hours and is closed on Satur- days now. Jorge doesn\u2019t really know that the bank is open tomorrow. Let\u2019s go to the bank now and get these checks deposited. A key question about these two scenarios concerns whether Sally spoke truly when she claimed in one scenario that Jorge knows the bank is open on Saturday and in the other claimed that he doesn\u2019t know.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
