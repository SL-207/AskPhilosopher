{"paragraph": " In this case, Rich had good evidence for believing that the show would start at 9pm; so evidentialism says that his belief was justified. Nevertheless, had he simply looked at the phone in his pocket he would have had additional evidence that would have not only made believing that the show starts at 9pm unjustified, it would have jus- tified believing that it starts at 7pm. It seems that Andrea\u2019s criticism of Rich for not checking his phone is appropriate. However, evi- dentialism says that there is nothing epistemically wrong with Rich\u2019s belief. But, if that is true, how can it be that Andrea\u2019s criticism is appropriate? JUSTIFICATION 146 RESPONSES One response to this sort of case is to claim that Andrea\u2019s criticism is appropriate because Rich\u2019s belief wasn\u2019t justified. The thought here is that contrary to evidentialism, evidence that one doesn\u2019t currently possess but should have possessed affects whether or not one is justi- fied. Since Rich could have easily checked and should have done so, the evidence that he could have had (but didn\u2019t) makes it so that his belief that the show starts at 9pm wasn\u2019t justified. Often this response is put forward by critics of evidentialism as a reason to look to other theories for the truth about justification. However, some evidential- ists have proposed that while the judgment about this case is correct, it doesn\u2019t mean that evidentialism is false. Hence, a version of this response suggests that evidentialism should really be understood as saying that justification depends upon the evidence that S has and on S\u2019s gathering that evidence in a responsible way (Cloos 2015). Given this version of evidentialism, Rich\u2019s belief that the show starts at 9pm wouldn\u2019t count as justified. The reason for this is that although his evi- dence prior to arriving at the venue supported believing that the show starts at 9pm, his evidence gathering wasn\u2019t conducted responsibly.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
