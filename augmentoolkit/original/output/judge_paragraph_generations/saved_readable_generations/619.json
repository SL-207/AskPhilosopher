{"paragraph": " To say of someone simply that he dislikes some\u00ad thing is not as informative as saying of him that he is irritated, terrified, or disappointed by it; and to say of someone that he is amused, ecstatic, or relieved by or over something is more informative than saying of him simply that he likes it. Yet although in what follows it will sometimes be important to distinguish between ( 1) liking or disliking a given thing regardless of whether one also regards it as being good or bad and (2) regarding a given thing as being good or bad regardless of whether one also likes or dislikes it, it will only rarely be important to distin\u00ad guish between the different species of liking and disliking. For this reason I shall usually speak simply of someone's liking or disliking a given thing without specifying any of the many ways in which a person can like or dislike something. I shall therefore use \"liking\" and \"disliking\" as generic terms in\u00ad tended to cover all the various species of liking and disliking. My use of these terms will thus be similar to, if not indeed identical with, Brent\u00ad ano's use of \"loving\" and \"hating\" .3 The terms \"loving\" and \"hating,\" however, in ordinary English have a more specific use than \"liking\" and \"disliking\". It is possible that a person like something without loving it and dislike something without hating it, as \"loving\" and \"hating\" are l 4 The Nature of Value frequently used in ordinary English. The terms \"liking\" and \"disliking\" therefore have a more generic use in ordinary English than \"loving\" and \"hating\" do, and because of this it seems better to use them rather than \"loving\" and \"hating\" to refer to the generic attitudes I shall be using them to indicate. Chapter 2 Ontological Categories and Bearers of Value This chapter is devoted to a treatment of a topic that has not received as much attention in recent years as it once did. This is the issue of the ontological categories of the bearers of intrinsic value.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
