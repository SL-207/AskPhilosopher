It is from the intrinsic value of this other state of affairs that x derives its extrinsic value. If so, then the total value of any state of affairs, x, can be determined only by taking into account both ( 1) the intrinsic value of x and (2) the intrinsic value of some other state of af\u00ad fairs, a, the intrinsic value of which determines the extrinsic value of x. Thus given that the intrinsic positive value of x is greater than that of y and that the extrinsic positive value of y is greater than that of x, which of the two has greater total positive value can be determined in the fol\u00ad lowing way: ( 1) subtract the intrinsic positive value of y from that of x, (2) subtract the intrinsic positive value of a, the state of affairs from the intrinsic positive value of which x derives its extrinsic value, from the intrinsic positive value of b, the state of affairs from which y derives its extrinsic value, and (3) determine whether the degree of positive in\u00ad trinsic value that remains upon the completion of step ( 1) is greater or less than that which remains upon the completion of step (2).", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
