(EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE\u2014 HERMENEUTICAL) Background: The previous entry discussed how one can be harmed by not receiving appropriate treatment as an epistemic agent.

One of these ways is for the person to be in a situation where the tools necessary for expressing the wrongness of their situation aren\u2019t available. In other words, it seems that someone can be harmed epistemically by being in a position where the knowledge of how to express harm isn\u2019t available.
