{"paragraph": " As a result, many of the responses to Gettier cases involve trying to solve the Gettier Problem, i.e. trying to determine what condition(s) must be added to justified true belief in order to have knowledge. RESPONSES One of the first responses to the Gettier Problem attempts to do away with justification as a requirement for knowledge altogether. The idea behind the causal theory of knowledge is that knowledge requires that one\u2019s true belief that p be causally connected in the appropriate way to the fact that p (Goldman 1967). In both of these cases, the fact that makes Smith\u2019s belief true isn\u2019t what is causing him to believe as he does. So, the causal theory of knowledge yields the correct result that Smith doesn\u2019t know in these cases. Another early response is what is called the \u201cno false reasons/ evidence\u201d approach (Clark 1963). Roughly, this says that in order for a justified true belief that p to count as knowledge, none of the justified beliefs that constitute one\u2019s evidence for p can be false. Smith fails to know on this account because in both cases he relies upon justified false beliefs (and so justified but false reasons) in his reasoning. A related response is that the strength of justification re- quired for knowledge is incompatible with the falsity of the justified belief (Sutton 2007, Littlejohn 2012). This response denies Gettier\u2019s assumption that the amount of justification required for knowledge still allows for the possible falsity of the belief in question. The idea here is that you simply cannot have justified false beliefs, so Smith\u2019s beliefs about Jones getting the promotion and having a Ferrari wouldn\u2019t count as justified in the first place. Of course, this would mean that the conclusions he comes to believe based on these beliefs aren\u2019t justified either. So, again, Smith wouldn\u2019t count as knowing under this view. Yet another early response appeals to the notion of \u201cdefeat\u201d (Lehrer and Paxson 1969).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
