{"paragraph": " If it were beer and not ice cream that normally is sweet, we should probably regard sweetness as a good-making prop\u00ad erty of beer but not of ice cream. This suggests that more is involved than is sometimes recognized in the etymological connection between \"normal\" on the one hand and \"norm\" or \"normative\" on the other. This is not to suggest that everything good is so because it is normal or that everything normal is good. As Moore points out, the excellence of Shakespeare was extraordinary, not normal. Moore refers to this excel\u00ad lence as \"abnormal\" .2 This way of referring to it is acceptable, provided that by \"abnormal\" one means only \"not normal\" in the non-pejorative sense of the term and not, as \"abnormal\" is frequently today taken as connoting, \"not normal\" in some pejorative sense that implies that what is said to be abnormal is not simply not normal but also in some way bad because it is not normal. That it is good that certain instances of certain kinds are normal can be shown by means of a few simple ex\u00ad amples. The first example concerns bodily deformities, the second mental or linguistic incapacitites, the third length of life. Persons, Things, and Value 95 One of the first things that parents of a newly born baby do upon seeing their child for the first time is to count its fingers and toes. They want it to have five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot. Why? The answer, I think, is that it is normal for human beings to have five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot. If it were normal to have six fingers on the right hand and seven on the left and eight toes on the right foot and nine on the left, the parents of the newly born baby would very probably be greatly disappointed to learn that it has only five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot. They would regard it as being deformed or malformed. We regard it as good that a baby have five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot because it is normal to have five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
