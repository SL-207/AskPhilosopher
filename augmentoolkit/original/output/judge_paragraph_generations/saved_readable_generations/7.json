{"paragraph": " The other eight chapters in this section also concern the question of whether physicalism falters when it comes to consciousness. Chapters 4\u20137 focus on arguments for answering that question in the affirmative, while Chapters 8\u201311 focus on arguments for answering in the negative. DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-3 THE FLOATING MAN BACKGROUND In Phaedo, Plato (c. 425\u2013357 bce) argued that the soul was separable from the body. Aristotle left the issue a little less clear. By defining the soul as the \u201cperfection\u201d or \u201cform\u201d of the body, it could seem as though the soul exists only as a modification of the body, and thus that its essence\u2014that which makes it what it is, and that it cannot exist without\u2014includes the body. Avicenna (a Latinization of Ibn Sina, 980\u20131037) argued otherwise using his Floating Man argument. Though the soul can be attached to a body, it need not be. The argu- ment is often seen as an anticipation of Descartes\u2019 (1596\u20131650) Sixth Meditation argument for the separability of the mind and the body\u2014 which is also based on a thought experiment involving conceiving of oneself (or one\u2019s mind or soul) as existing disembodied. THE CASE Imagine that God created you, suddenly and fully formed, floating in the sky. You have no sight, and none of your limbs are in contact with one another. You do not see or feel your body. Additionally, suppose that you do not feel the air against your skin. In that oddly suspended state, though you would have no awareness of your body, you could be confident that you existed. You would not only know you exist; you 1 CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 6 would fully grasp your essence without even thinking that you occu- pied space. Since you are able to grasp your essence without thinking of yourself as spatial or embodied, your essence, and thus your soul, is immaterial and distinct from the body. DISCUSSION The most natural response to the Floating Man argument is to claim that it illicitly moves from an epistemological premise\u2014about what the floating man would know or be aware of\u2014to a metaphysical \u00adconclusion\u2014about the floating man\u2019s essence and the immateriality of the soul.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
