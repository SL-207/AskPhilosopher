{"paragraph": " I cannot, that is, believe that each of two con\u00ad flicting evaluations is acceptable, correct, or true if I know or believe that they conflict. We can also dislike both some of our own present likings, dislikings, valuings, and evaluations and also various of those of others that agree with various of our own. Thus I might dislike both my own and also your evaluation that my liking to look at the accident victims is inap\u00ad propriate, unfitting, wrong, or bad. And even though I might dislike your and my evaluation and continue to like looking at accident victims despite my regarding it as inappropriate, I might nonetheless resolve to refrain from indulging this liking, endeavor earnestly to keep this reso\u00ad lution, and indeed also succeed fully in doing so. If so, then I refrain from doing something I like doing because I evaluate my doing the thing in question as- inappropriate. W. D. Ross maintained that \"there is no more mystery in the fact that the thought of an act as one's duty should arouse an impulse to do it, than in the fact that the thought of an act as pleasant, or as leading to pleasure, should arouse an impulse to do it.\" 1 Similarly, there is no more mystery in the fact that a person's evaluation of something he likes doing as inappropriate should lead him to refrain from doing it, even though he dislikes his evaluation, than in the fact that a person's liking to do something should lead him to do it. If so, then just as a person's liking to do something can lead him to do it, so also his evaluation of his doing the thing in question as inappropriate can lead him to refrain from doing it even though he dislikes his evalua\u00ad tion. In this way a person's valuings and evaluations can have as direct an effect on his conduct as his likings and dislikings and, because of this, can have as much importance for practice as his likings and dislikings. But, as I shall argue more fully later on, just as the goodness or bad\u00ad ness of likings and dislikings depends on the goodness or badness of what is liked or disliked, so also the goodness or badness of one's valu\u00ad ings depends on that of whatever it is that one regards as good or bad.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
