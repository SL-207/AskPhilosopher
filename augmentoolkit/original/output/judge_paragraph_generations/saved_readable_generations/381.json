One of the things that we noted was that although it is widely thought that the traditional account of knowledge is ultimately flawed, it is just as widely (perhaps even more so) thought that the three components of the traditional account (justification, belief, and truth) are each necessary for knowledge. As with many things in philosophy, the consensus on this point is not universal. There are some who question whether various components of the traditional account of knowl- edge are really necessary. One of the more interesting challenges alleges that one can have knowledge without belief. More precisely, S can know that p, even though S does not believe that p is true.
