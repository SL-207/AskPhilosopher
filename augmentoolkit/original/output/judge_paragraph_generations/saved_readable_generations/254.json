We are encouraged to draw up an inventory of all that we find in experience. When we do, we will discover that there is noth- ing unchanging that endures throughout our changing experiences, and that there is nothing underneath our experiences that has them (see Chapter 46). For the Buddhists this is not merely an arcane philosophical point: letting go of the notion of self is essential to freeing ourselves from suffering and reaching enlightenment. Many, though, find this no-self view, or anatta, counterintuitive. We seem to be committed to a self by our language and concepts\u2014some of our names and pronouns surely refer to something, and what do they refer to if not a self? Further, the no-self view seems to fly in the face of the Buddhist view of reincarnation as well as the more mundane view that we persist through time.
