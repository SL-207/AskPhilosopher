{"paragraph": " It is be\u00ad cause the attainment of my long-term interests would be intrinsically good that I ought to act compatibly with their promotion, and it is be\u00ad cause the attainment of your long-term interests would be intrinsically good that you ought to act compatibly with their promotion. It would seem, however, that if the fact that the attainment of my long-term in\u00ad terests would be intrinsically good gives me a reason for acting com\u00ad patibly with their promotion, then, as Moore argued long ago, it also gives you a reason for doing so if you can. 2 Similarly, if the fact that the attainment of your long-term interests would be intrinsically good gives you a reason for acting compatibly with their promotion, then it also gives me a reason for doing so if I can. If, in short, the fact that the ex\u00ad istence of something, x, would be intrinsically good gives one person a 164 The Nature of Value reason for acting compatibly with its existence, then it also gives any other person in a position to do so a reason for doing so. The \"teleological\" egoist might attempt to evade this argument by assuming something akin to a solipsistic or quasi-solipsistic position and maintaining that it is only the attainment of his long-term interests, not those of any other person, that would be intrinsically good. If, how\u00ad ever, the fact that the attainment of his long-term interests would be intrinsically good gives him a reason for acting compatibly with their attainment, then, as before, it also provides anyone else capable of pro\u00ad moting his interests a reason for doing so. This would mean that not only the egoist but anyone else who has any dealings with him acts rightly only if they act compatibly with the promotion of his interests. It is hard, however, to say the least, to see why only the attainment of the interests of the egoist, and not also the attainment of the interests of others, would be intrinsically good.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
