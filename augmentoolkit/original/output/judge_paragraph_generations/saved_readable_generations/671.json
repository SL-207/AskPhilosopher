{"paragraph": " If so, then neither a nor b can have intrinsic value. A has instrumental value as a means to b, and b might also have such value as a means to something else, c. In order, however, that a have instrumental value as a means to b and b as a means to c, as opposed to having only utility, then c, or something else, d, to which c is a means, must have inherent value as something that is directly or immediately liked or disliked. (To avoid redundancy, I shall refer to immediately or directly liking or disliking something simply as liking or disliking it.) If neither a nor b are liked or disliked they have no inherent value but instead have only instrumental value as a means to something else, c or d, that has inherent value. If, however, a or b themselves are liked or disliked they have inherent as well as instrumental value. But although a, b, and c, and also d if it is a means to something else, e, can each have both instrumental and inherent value, none can have intrinsic value if none is itself an experience. It is only the experience of any of them that can have such value. Such expe\u00ad riences are intrinsically good if they are liked, intrinsically bad if they are disliked, intrinsically indifferent if they are neither liked nor dis\u00ad liked. Similar considerations apply to contributory value. If x is a part of y, and if x contributes to the value of y, then x has contributory value relative to y. The part, x, and the whole, y, might also have inherent value. Each has such value if each is liked or disliked. Neither, however, can have intrinsic value if neither is an experience. Instead, it is only the experience of either that can have such value. The experience of either is intrinsically good if it is liked, intrinsically bad if it is disliked, intrin\u00ad sically indifferent if it is neither liked nor disliked. In order, however, that something have inherent value it is not neces\u00ad sary that it actually be liked or disliked by anyone.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
