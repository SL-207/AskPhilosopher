{"paragraph": " First, propositions presuppose the obtaining and the non-obtaining of states of affairs, in the sense that no proposition could be true or false in the absence of the obtaining and the non-obtaining of states of affairs. It is because various states of affairs do or do not obtain that various propositions are true or false. Ontological Categories and Bearers of Value 17 Second, for any given state of affairs there is a pair of propositions, one to the effect that it obtains, the other to the effect that it does not obtain. Which of the two is true depends upon whether the state of affairs in question does or does not obtain. We turn now to consider briefly some of the relations holding between ( 1) states of affairs, the obtaining and the non-obtaining of states of affairs, and propositions and (2) facts. The term \"fact\" is used in different senses. In one of its senses it is used to designate states of affairs that obtain. In this sense of the term those states of affairs that obtain are facts, whereas those that do not obtain are not facts. Thus the Eiffel Tower's being in Paris is a fact, since that state of affairs obtains, whereas the Eiffel Tower's being in London is not a fact, since that state of affairs does not obtain. To admit the category of facts in this sense, however, is not to introduce another category in addition to that of states of affairs that obtain, since the term \"fact\" in this sense is only another name for such states of affairs and designates nothing dis\u00ad tinct from or in addition to them. A second sense of the term \"fact\" is that in which it is used to desig\u00ad nate the obtaining or the non-obtaining of a state of affairs, as distinct from the state of affairs that does or does not obtain. In this sense of the term, the obtaining of the state of affairs consisting of the Eiffel Tower's being in Paris is a fact distinct from the fact consisting of that state of affairs, which is a fact in the first sense of \"fact\".", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
