{"paragraph": " Part of the pur\u00ad pose of doing the latter prior to attempting an explication of the con\u00ad cept of intrinsic value has been to cite instances of phenomena of certain types that many people would agree have intrinsic value, whether posi\u00ad tive or negative, and that some would claim to know have such value. In agreeing or in claiming to know that such instances have such value they are agreeing or claiming to know that the concept of intrinsic value does in fact have an application-that it does in fact apply to phe\u00ad nomena of various kinds-regardless of whether the concept itself can be adequately defined and of whether claims to the effect that a given thing is intrinsically good or bad can be proved. It is time now to address ourselves to these questions. 1. The Definability of Intrinsic Value One might attempt to define the concept of intrinsic value by distin\u00ad guishing such value from extrinsic value. This might be done by saying that the intrinsic value of a given thing, again taking \"thing\" in the broadest possible sense, is the value it has in itself, taken in abstraction 59 60 The Nature of Value from its relationship to anything else and thus in abstraction from any instrumental or contributory value it might have. Such a definition, while doubtless acceptable as far as it goes, does not go far enough. As was suggested in chapter 1, value may be regarded as a genus or deter\u00ad minable of which the most general species or determinations are posi\u00ad tive, negative, and neutral value. To say that a thing has positive value is to say that it is good, in a wide sense of \"good\"; to say that it has neg\u00ad ative value is to say that it is bad, in a wide sense of \"bad\"; and to say that it is neutral in value is to say that it is neither good nor bad. This means that the concept of value is definabfe or explicable only in terms of the concepts of good, bad, and indifferent, so that to understand the concept of value it is necessary to understand the latter concepts in terms of which it is defined or explicated.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
