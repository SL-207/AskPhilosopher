{"paragraph": " Such a liking is good if the first-order liking or disliking that is its object is good, bad if the corresponding first-order liking or disliking is bad. Thus my liking my liking of something good is itself good, as is also my liking your dis\u00ad liking something bad; and your liking my liking something bad is itself bad, as is also your liking your disliking something good. Similarly, a second-order disliking is good if the first-order liking or disliking that is its object is bad, bad if the corresponding first-order liking or disliking is good. Thus your disliking your liking something bad is good, as is also your disliking my disliking something good; and my disliking your liking something good is bad, as is also my disliking my disliking some\u00ad thing bad. Thus just as to like a good and to dislike a bad thing is good and to like a bad and to dislike a good thing is bad, so also to like a good and to dislike a bad liking or disliking is good and to like a bad and to dislike a good liking or disliking is bad. 1 To some it might seem that the goodness or badness of an object, whether it be the object of a first-order or a second-order liking or dis\u00ad liking, does not suffice to make the liking of a good and the disliking of a bad object good. Instead, it might be thought, the liking of a good and the disliking of a bad object is good only if the good object is liked to the degree to which it is good and the bad disliked to the degree to which it is bad. On such a view, the liking of a good object is bad if the degree to which it is liked is greater or less than the degree to which it merits being liked, and, similarly, the disliking of a bad object is bad if the degree to which it is disliked is greater or less than the degree to which it merits being disliked. Thus on such a view it is not sufficient that the object liked be good or that the object disliked be bad if the liking and the disliking are themselves to be good.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
