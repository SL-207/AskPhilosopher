{"paragraph": " Instead, it is also nec\u00ad essary that the good object be liked to the precise degree to which it is good, neither more nor less, and, similarly, that the bad object be dis\u00ad liked to the precise degree to which it is bad, neither more nor less. If such a view were correct, the symmetry suggested above between the goodness of liking good and disliking bad objects on the one hand and the badness of liking bad and disliking good objects on the other would not exist. This is the case because the view in question does not deny that it is bad to like bad and to dislike good objects, regardless of the degree to which bad objects are liked and good objects disliked. It does not deny, that is, that the badness of an object suffices to make 174 The Nature of Value liking it bad or that the goodness of an object suffices to make disliking it bad, regardless of the degree to which a bad object is liked or a good object disliked. It would, however, if correct, make it much harder for likings of good objects and dislikings of bad objects to be good. Indeed, given the great difficulty of liking good and disliking bad objects to the precise degree to which they merit being liked or disliked, very few indeed of such likings and dislikings would be good. Although they would not be as bad as likings of bad and dislikings of good objects, few would be good because few are proportioned precisely to the goodness or badness of their objects. It is hard enough for most of us to like only good and to dislike only bad objects, and to require of us not only that we like only good and dislike only bad objects but also that we like and dislike them neither more nor less than they merit being liked or dis\u00ad liked is to impose upon us a requirement that few, if any, of us have much chance of satisfying. Fortunately, however, the view in question does not seem to be cor\u00ad rect. We can agree that it is better to like good and to dislike bad objects neither more nor less than they merit being liked or disliked than it is to like the good and to dislike the bad either more or less than they merit.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
