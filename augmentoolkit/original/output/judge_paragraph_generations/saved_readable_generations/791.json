{"paragraph": " It is because of this that prac\u00ad tical reason has primacy over theoretical reason. Throughout much of this chapter I have used the terminology of prac\u00ad tical and theoretical rationality. This I have done primarily because such terminology is familiar and has a long history going back at least to Aristotle. I believe, however, that a better terminology, at least for the purposes of value theory, would be that of axiological and epistemic ra\u00ad tionality. The concept of axiological rationality corresponds more or less to the concept of practical rationality, that of epistemic rationality more or less to that of theoretical rationality. Just as practical rationality has primacy over theoretical rationality, so also, for much the same rea\u00ad sons, axiological rationality has primacy over epistemic rationality. Chapter 8 Morality and Rationality In the last chapter we examined some aspects of the difference between practical and theoretical reason and their relationship to one another. We turn now to consider in somewhat more detail various views of what practical rationality consists in and of its relationship to morality. 1. Acting Morally and Acting Rationally Different philosophers have taken different positions concerning the nature of practical rationality. Two widely held positions may be stated roughly, but with sufficient precision for our purposes here, as follows. On one view practical rationality consists of using whatever means happen to be appropriate for the attainment of whatever end one hap\u00ad pens to have, regardless of what it might happen to be. The adoption of any end, however, regardless of whatever it might be, is no more nor any less rational than the adoption of any other end. On this view, to take an example from Hume, it is not irrational for me to prefer the destruction of the world to the scratching of my finger. 1 If I do have such a preference, then practical rationality in my case consists of taking appropriate means to prevent the scratching of my finger even if doing so requires the destruction of the world.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
