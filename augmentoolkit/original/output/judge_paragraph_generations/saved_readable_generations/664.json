{"paragraph": " Thus a and b can be considered as constituting a whole of which each is a part. If they are so considered, then each, so considered, has positive, negative, or neutral contributory value, depending upon whether and how they contribute to the value of the whole. Each has positive contributory value if it contributes to the goodness of the whole, negative contributory value if it contributes to the badness of the whole, neutral contributory value if it contributes neither to the goodness nor to the badness of the whole. From the fact, however, that a means and the end to which it is a means can be con\u00ad sidered as constituting a whole of which they are parts, it does not follow that instrumental value is a species of contributory value. Nei\u00ad ther of these two forms of value is reducible to the other. If a has instru\u00ad mental value as a means to something else, b, that has intrinsic value, a has instrumental value relative only to b, of which it is not a part, and not relative to some whole containing a and b as parts. And if a and b have contributory value relative to some whole of which they are parts, they have such value relative only to the whole containing them, and not relative to one another. In each of the nine wholes we have considered, each of the parts has either positive or negative intrinsic value. This, however, does not mean that each part of any given whole must have such value if it is to have either positive or negative contributory value. The top and each of the legs of our table has contributory value, since each contributes to the value of the table, which is the whole of which they are parts. From this, however, it does not follow that any of these parts has any intrinsic value \u00b7whatever, whether taken as parts of the table or taken singly in abstraction from any consideration of their status as parts of the table. If so, then various parts of a given whole can have contributory value Species of Value 49 regardless of whether any of them have any intrinsic value at all.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
