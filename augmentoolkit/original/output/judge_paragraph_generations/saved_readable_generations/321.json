{"paragraph": " She refers to these kinds of cases as big decisions, and they involve what L. A. Paul (2014) calls transformative experiences. For Paul, transformative experiences have both an epistemic dimension and a personal dimen- sion. When an experience is epistemically transformative, the experiencer learns something that is in principle epistemically inaccessible to them absent that experience. When an experience is personally transformative, the experiencer undergoes changes to their individual point of view and personal preferences that are not fully predictable in advance. As described by Ullmann-Margalit, in these kinds of cases one emerges after the decision as a different person. All of this seems to make the calculation of expected value impos- sible. Someone facing one of these decisions doesn\u2019t know what the experience is like, and it looks like they can\u2019t trust their imaginings of what the experience is like. So, they can\u2019t do the sort of cognitive modeling that one might normally do in a decision-making context, the kind of modeling where one imaginatively projects oneself into each situation and compares the two. Hence, we have the puzzle of PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 310 transformative choice: In cases involving transformative experience, it appears to be impossible for us to make decisions that are both ra- tional and authentic. DISCUSSION In addressing the puzzle of transformative choice, some philosophers offer what we might think of as skeptical solutions. People who adopt this strategy accept that in cases of transformative choice we can\u2019t make rational and authentic decisions in the usual way. There is no direct solution to the puzzle. But they think there are other ways that we might handle decision-making in these cases, and thus that we can give indirect solutions. For example, Paul herself suggests that cases of transformative experience present us with situations in which we have to make \u201ca leap into the unknown\u201d (2020, p.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
