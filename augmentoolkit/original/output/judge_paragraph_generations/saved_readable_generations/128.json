According to Descartes, to be physical is to be extended in three spatial dimensions. But that 17th-century definition is out of line with current science. Contemporary philoso- phers often characterize the physical by deferring to physics: physical phenomena are those that are described by physical theory. But such deference leads to a problem known as Hempel\u2019s dilemma. THE CASE Physicalists claim that the mind is a physical phenomenon. Dualists re- ject that claim, holding that the mind is non-physical or that there are non-physical mental properties. The disagreement seems substantial, but it is not entirely clear what the disagreement amounts to. What does it mean to say (or deny) that something is physical? Descartes had a clear answer: to say that something is physical is to say that it is extended in space. But that answer is outdated. For exam- ple, modern physics posits phenomena that are not extended in the sense Descartes meant, such as gravitational force. How should we, in the 21st century, understand what it means to be physical? 21 Hempel\u2019s Dilemma 123 A natural strategy for answering that question is to defer to science. Physical phenomena are those physical theory posits\u2014or those plus the entities that such phenomena constitute (Loewer 2001). For ex- ample, if physical theory posits quarks and leptons, then quarks and leptons qualify as physical\u2014and so does anything that is constituted by quarks and leptons, such as rocks, tables, and planets.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
