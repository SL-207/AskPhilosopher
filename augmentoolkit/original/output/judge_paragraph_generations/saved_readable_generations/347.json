{"paragraph": " This book brings together fifty of the most important and widely discussed puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments in epistemology. The entries are grouped around themes, but they can be read in any order. Additionally, there are cross-references throughout to help readers connect relevant points of contact between various entries. Each entry includes a brief discussion of the major responses to the puzzle, paradox, or thought experiment described so that readers can get a sense not only of the example itself but also of the positions on it that have emerged in the epistemological literature. The suggested readings that accompany each entry offer readers direction for diving more deeply into the issues surrounding entries that pique their interest. Given the structure of this book, there is a variety of ways that it might be used in an epistemology or general philosophy course or even for individual study. One way would be to pair this book with an epistemology textbook so that students can explore the thought experiments and puzzles that motivate the general theories covered in the textbook. Another way would be to use this book as the sole primary text using the entries to spark engaging class discussions. Of course, there are many other ways that one might use this book in class or in one\u2019s own study. The entries in this book are accessible to PREFACE Preface x the beginning epistemology student, and yet informative enough\u2014 especially with the suggested readings\u2014to be a handy resource for researchers. I have many people to thank for their help with this project. Andy Beck enthusiastically supported this project from the start, and he, like the entire team at Routledge, was a pleasure to work with at every stage of the process. Adam Carter and Jon Matheson pointed me to key literature for several of the entries. Maddie Burchfield, Peter \u00adGraham, Nikolas Pham, Parker Rose, Karthik Sadanand, \u00adTanvee Sinha, and anonymous reviewers graciously provided very helpful feedback on an earlier draft of the book.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
