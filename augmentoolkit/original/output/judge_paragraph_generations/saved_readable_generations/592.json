{"paragraph": " But, intuitively, we shouldn\u2019t believe that Fred stole the TV. Nevertheless, once an eyewitness tells us that Fred stole the TV, it seems that we have sufficient evidence for believing he did so, even though this evidence doesn\u2019t make his theft as probable as the purely statistical evidence does. RESPONSES One response to the proof paradox is to insist that in order for evi- dence to be sufficient in a legal setting (and perhaps epistemically as well), there must be a causal connection between the evidence and the claim in question (Thomson 1986). For example, the reason that testimonial evidence is sufficient for ruling in Ginger\u2019s favor is that the bus\u2019s being blue is a cause of the eyewitness\u2019s testimony. The sta- tistical evidence fails to meet this requirement because there isn\u2019t a causal connection between the color of the bus that hit Ginger and PROOF PARADOX 251 the statistical fact that 85% of the buses in town are blue. Hence, this response claims that the reason we have the intuitions that we do in BUSES and TVs is that the statistical evidence lacks the right sort of causal connection to the claim in question. Another response is to appeal to sensitivity (see A Strange County pp. 16\u201320 and Red Barns and Blue Fa\u00e7ades pp. 21\u201324 for more on sen- sitivity) (Enoch et al. 2012). The idea here is that in order for evidence to actually meet legal standards, it has to be the case that if the claim in question were false, the evidence wouldn\u2019t obtain. For instance, if Fred didn\u2019t steal the TV, the eyewitness wouldn\u2019t have said that he did. However, even if Fred didn\u2019t steal the TV, it would still be the case that it is 99% likely that he did given the number of TVs stolen on the day he walked out of the store with his TV. Yet another response is to accept a view under which one\u2019s evi- dence consists of all and only what one knows (Williamson 2000). In this case, when the eyewitness tells us that Fred stole the TV we come to know that he did.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
