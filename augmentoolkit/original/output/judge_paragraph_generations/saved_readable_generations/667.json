{"paragraph": " 5 The number of combinations of such things is so large that none of us can ever know them all. And of the tiny fraction of such com\u00ad binations that anyone can ever know, only a fraction of that fraction are such that they are regarded by the person who knows them as being good or bad, the remainder being regarded as being neither good nor bad. The totality of such parts and wholes-known and unknown, liked or disliked, good, bad, or neither good nor bad-is the actual world, which is the whole that has as parts every part and every whole that exists, occurs, or obtains except itself and which is not itself a part of any whole. As in the case of any other whole, the goodness, badness, or indifference of this whole that is not itself a part of any other whole is determined by the goodness, badness, or indifference of its parts. The same laws of value, if \"laws\" they may be called, that apply to its var\u00ad ious parts and wholes apply also to the whole that contains all these parts and wholes but is not itself a part of any whole. Each of its parts has positive contributory value to the degree to which they contribute to the intrinsic goodness of the whole that contains them all, negative contributory value to the degree to which they diminish its intrinsic goodness. The all-inclusive whole is itself intrinsically good if the posi\u00ad tive value of its good parts is greater than the negative value of its bad parts, intrinsically bad if the negative value of its bad parts is greater than the positive value of its good parts. Species of Value 51 Although the various parts of the world have positive or negative contributory value relative to the world, depending upon whether they increase or diminish its intrinsic goodness, they have no instrumental value relative to the world. This is because they are not means to its existence as something of which they are not parts, since they all are part of it.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
