{"paragraph": " Of course, everyone can agree that they should recalculate (perhaps using a calcu- lator this time) to figure out what each person actually owes. But what about their beliefs before those new calculations are completed? The is- sue when it comes to the epistemology of disagreement is whether Asa or Pedro (or both) should change their belief at the time they first learn of the disagreement\u2014have they lost (or, no one holds this view, gained) justification by learning that their epistemic peer disagrees with them? RESPONSES There have been a number of positions defended in the epistemology of disagreement literature. One position, what is called the equal weight view, was proposed as a response to exactly this sort of case (Christensen 2007, Feldman 2007, Matheson 2015). According to the equal weight view, you should give equal weight to your epistemic peer\u2019s thinking as you do to your own. In particular, the equal weight view says that learning that an epistemic peer disagrees gives Asa good reasons for thinking that she is mistaken that are equal to the reasons she has for thinking she is correct based on her own assessment of the check. And, the same is true of Pedro. The equal weight view says that unless Asa (or Pedro) has some independent evidence for thinking that it is her peer who has made a mistake (evidence that is independent of the fact that Pedro disagrees about the check), her belief that everyone owes $20 each is defeated. Hence, according to the equal weight view in this situation, Asa and Pedro should give up their beliefs because they are no longer epistemically justified. Instead of believing, they should now suspend judgment about how much each person owes until they get new evidence\u2014such as they would get when they recalculate. Another position on disagreement is what is called the steadfast view (Kelly 2005). As the name suggests, this view claims that you should remain steadfast in your belief in the face of peer disagreement.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
