{"paragraph": " While we\u2019ve attempted to keep jargon to a minimum, it\u2019s hard to avoid some technical terms that are widely used by philoso- phers of mind, so we\u2019ve also included a brief glossary. Although this brief introduction has provided only a quick glimpse of the topics covered in this book, we hope your interest has been piqued. Rather than taking more time on preliminary matters, we\u2019ll stop here so that you can dive into the puzzles and see what grabs you! PART I CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM Introduction How should we understand the relationship between the mental and the physical? That is a way of stating a central problem in the philos- ophy of mind known as the mind\u2013body problem. In Western philosophy, contemporary discussions of the mind\u2013body problem trace to Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 17th-century writings. He argued for a sort of dualist view on which the mind is an immaterial thing that is importantly dis- tinct from the body. Defining body in terms of extension and mind in terms of thought and consciousness, Descartes reasoned that he could clearly and distinctly conceive of his mind without his body and of his body without his mind. He went on to infer that his mind and body can exist without each other, and thus are what he termed \u201creally distinct.\u201d In other words, the mind and the body are fundamentally distinct substances. This position is known as substance dualism. Descartes\u2019 discussion did not arise out of nowhere. Centuries \u00adearlier, Ibn Sina (commonly known as Avicenna) drew similar \u00adconclusions based on his \u201cfloating man\u201d thought experiment. He imagined a man floating through the air without any awareness of his body or the phys- ical environment, but nonetheless knowing that he exists. \u00adChapter\u00a01 discusses that case. Chapter 2 concerns another \u00adhistorical case: \u00adLeibniz\u2019s mill, a thought experiment devised by Gottfried \u00adWilhelm DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-2 CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 4 Leibniz.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
