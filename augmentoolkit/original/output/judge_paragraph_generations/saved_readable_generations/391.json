{"paragraph": " To say that someone\u2019s belief counterfactually depends upon her having some evidence means one or both of two things. First, it can mean that the person wouldn\u2019t have the belief that p if she didn\u2019t have the evidence she does. Second, it can mean that the person would have the belief that p if she does have the evidence. Simply put, the idea is that the person\u2019s belief that p is based upon her evidence when her having that evidence explains why she has the belief and/or if she were to lack the evidence she has, the lack of evidence would explain why she doesn\u2019t have the belief. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: BASING RELATION Saul is a very competent, if a bit unscrupulous, lawyer, but he\u2019s also very superstitious. Usually, his superstitions don\u2019t make a difference to the performance of his duties as a lawyer. However, on this occasion they do. NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 44 Saul is defending a client who is on trial for four horrendous crimes. Saul knows for a fact that his client committed three of these crimes. This doesn\u2019t matter to Saul though; he\u2019s still going to mount the best defense he possibly can. After all, Saul always says that it\u2019s the prose- cution\u2019s job to make sure the guilty are punished; it\u2019s Saul\u2019s job to win cases and make sure clients don\u2019t go to jail. He doesn\u2019t care whether his clients are innocent. In fact, he tends to believe that his clients are guilty. But, in the case of this particular client something interesting occurs. Saul already knows that the client committed three of the four crimes. However, one afternoon a few days before the trial is set, Saul reviews all of the evidence related to the fourth crime and realizes to his utter amazement that it provides conclusive support for thinking that his client is actually innocent of this crime. Nevertheless, Saul can\u2019t bring himself to believe that his client is innocent. He sees that the evidence provides very good reason for thinking that the client is innocent, and yet he still believes his client is guilty.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
