{"paragraph": " Although the truth of sentences used to assert that a given thing is intrinsically good might entail and be entailed by the truth of certain other sentences used to assert something else about the thing in question, no sentences of the latter type capture or express the essence of intrinsic goodness. For this reason the concept of intrinsic goodness is indefinable in the strictest sense of the term \"def\u00ad inition,\" according to which a definition states the essence of the object being defined. From this, however, it does not follow that we do not know the meaning of a given indefinable term, that we do not have the Definition, Proof, and Knowledge of Intrinsic Value 67 concept it expresses, or that we do not know the essence of the object of the concept. To some this might seem to be an untenable position and an undesir\u00ad able outcome. Just a little reflection, however, should show that it is not. If in order to know the meaning of any term it were necessary that we be able to define both it and also every other term in terms of which it is defined, then we could not know the meaning of any term. I might define \"a\" in terms of \"b \" \"b\" in terms of \"c \" \"c\" in terms of \"d \" and ' ' ' so on. It is evident, however, that this process cannot go on forever. There are only two ways of stopping it. One is to present a circular def\u00ad inition and define, say, \"d\" in terms of \"a\". For obvious reasons, how\u00ad ever, such definitions are unacceptable. The only other alternative is to accept some term as primitive or undefined, say \"d\". From the fact, however, that \"d\" is primitive or undefined it does not follow that we do not know its meaning. Unless we knew its meaning we could not know adequately the meaning of \"a,\" \"b,\" \"c,\" which are defined ulti\u00ad mately in terms of it. If then, we are to know the meaning of any term, there must be some term the m\u0414aning of which we know even though we cannot define it.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
