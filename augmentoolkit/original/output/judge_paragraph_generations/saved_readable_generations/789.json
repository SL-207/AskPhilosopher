{"paragraph": " If so, such dislike is likely to issue from a belief that such talk implies, or at least suggests, that practical and 146 The Nature of Value theoretical reason have an end, goal, or purpose independently of, and not reducible to, various of the ends, goals, or purposes of human beings. No such implication or suggestion is intended. Instead, to say that the goal of theoretical reason is the acquisition of knowledge is to say nothing more than that human beings sometimes desire to acquire knowledge as an end. Given such a desire, it is an empirical fact that we are likely to satisfy it more completely if we accept propositions only if we have more evidence for believing them to be true than we have for believing them to be false. It is because of. the existence of such a desire, coupled with the empirical fact just indicated, that it is rational, from the standpoint of theoretical reason, to accept propositions only if we have more evidence for believing them to be true than for believing them to be false. Theoretical rationality consists in our doing this only because we are more likely to increase our knowledge if we do than if we do not. Similarly, to say that the goal of practical rationality is the attainment as an end of something other than knowledge is to say nothing more than that human beings sometimes desire as an end the attainment of something other than knowledge. Given such a desire, it is an empirical fact that sometimes we are more likely to satisfy it if we accept certain propositions even though we have no more evidence for believing them to be true than for believing them to be false. It is because of the existence of such a desire, coupled with the empirical fact just indicated, that it is sometimes rational, from the standpoint of prac\u00ad tical reason, to accept certain propositions even though we have as much evidence for believing them to be false as for believing them to be true.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
