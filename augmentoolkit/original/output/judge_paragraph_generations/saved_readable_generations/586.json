{"paragraph": " So, for this large set of claims Sharon believes all of them. But she says (and presumably believes) that at least one of the members of the set of claims she makes in the book is mistaken. Again, this seems to be something that Sharon rationally/justifiedly believes on the basis of the fact that pretty much every book with as many claims as hers has at least some errors. However, this suggests that Sharon believes that each member of the set of claims made in her book is true and at the same time believes that the members of the set of claims in her book are not all true. It clearly cannot be the case that all of the claims in her book are true and some of them are false. It appears that Sharon\u2019s beliefs are inconsistent. What is more, Sharon seems perfectly aware of this apparent inconsistency in her beliefs. And yet, it seems that Sharon isn\u2019t being unreasonable, i.e. she seems to be rational/jus- tified in believing the claims she made in her book and also believing that she has made some errors in the book. How can this be? RESPONSES Similar to the Lottery Paradox (see the previous entry), the Preface Paradox makes use of CONJUNCTION and NO CONTRADIC- TION (though, since the Preface Paradox isn\u2019t in terms of probabil- ities, it doesn\u2019t rely upon SUFFICIENCY). There is a problem with Sharon\u2019s beliefs because it seems that her belief that the conjunction is true contradicts her belief that she has made at least some errors, i.e. her belief that the conjunction is false. Given that the Preface Par- adox, like the Lottery Paradox, assumes CONJUNCTION and NO CONTRADICTION, two of the ways of responding to the Preface Paradox are similar to responses to the Lottery Paradox. One way of responding is to deny NO CONTRADICTION by accepting that PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 246 although Sharon\u2019s beliefs are inconsistent, they are still rational. Unlike the Lottery Paradox, a sizeable number of theorists have opted for claiming that the Preface Paradox shows exactly this\u2014one can have inconsistent beliefs and yet all of those beliefs are justified (Klein 1985, Foley 1993, Priest 1998).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
