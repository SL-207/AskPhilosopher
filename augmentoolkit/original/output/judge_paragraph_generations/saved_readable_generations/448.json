{"paragraph": " Intuitively, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d Even though Lucky III was the favorite to win the race, there were 19 other top horses in the race, and though Lucky III\u2019s odds are some of the best in history 2\u20135 (as of the writing of this, 2\u20135 odds are the shortest odds that a horse has been given for winning the Kentucky derby), it\u2019s still likely that Lucky III didn\u2019t win. After all, 2\u20135 odds mean that it is predicted that Lucky III would win two out of seven times in this race, i.e. less than 30% of the time. Hence, despite being heavily the favorite to win the race, the probability of Lucky III winning is significantly lower than 50%. As a result, it seems clear that Bas shouldn\u2019t believe that Lucky III won. Instead, he should think that the winner was in the group of DISJUNCTION OBJECTION TO IBE 101 the other 19 horses. However, it isn\u2019t clear that inference to the best explanation (IBE) can yield this result. Let\u2019s think about the situation in a bit more detail. The facts that need to be explained are that the race was won and the various qual- ities of the horses racing. Which potential explanation best explains these facts? It seems that \u201cLucky III won\u201d is the best explanation. Lucky III was the favorite to win because he has qualities that make him superior to the each of the other horses when it comes to racing. Another way to look at it is this: if we were to compare each of the other 19 horses with Lucky III, that Lucky III won would be a better explanation than that the other horse won. For example, that Lucky III won is a better explanation than that horse 1 won, it\u2019s a better explanation than that horse 2 won, and so on. Hence, it seems that Lucky III\u2019s winning is the best explanation of the evidence, and yet it seems that it would be unreasonable for Bas to infer that Lucky III won the race. It appears that IBE yields the wrong result by licensing an inference to a conclusion that is likely false.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
