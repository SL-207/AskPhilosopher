{"paragraph": " As she notes in a letter posted to the website Trekdoc.com: I\u2019ve been a Star Trek fan as long as I can remember. \u2026 The positive future, our planet working with a league of other planets, and the intelligence and ideals that Gene Roddenberry and crew cleverly weaved into the plots \u2026 made it something that I could embrace for our future. The Adams case suggests that narratives are something that individuals construct for themselves. Barbara has deliberately and self-consciously developed a self-narrative organized around her love of Star Trek. She is not deluded. She recognizes that she is not actually a member of Starfleet, and that Star Trek is a fictional television show. Nonetheless, her fandom not only deeply affects how she lives her life but also her sense of who she is. The Trekkie, Mr. Oreo, and Narrative Conceptions of the Self 303 What about individuals who are deluded, that is, who have con- structed self-narratives that seem disconnected from the actual facts of their life? Let\u2019s take a hypothetical case: Avery is a Wall Street banker who for years has been working 80-hour weeks in determined pursuit of career advancement and personal wealth. She acts competitively and even ruthlessly towards her colleagues. But when she thinks about herself and her life, these facts do not play a big role. Avery is not de- liberately trying to misrepresent herself. Rather, she simply engages in a selective attention in the weaving of her story. She focuses on the birthday presents she\u2019s bought rather than the birthday parties she failed to attend; she remembers clapping loudly at her son\u2019s perfor- mance in the school play but manages to ignore the fact that she\u2019d arrived late to the show; her recollection of the family vacation in Hawaii excludes the fact that she spent most of the trip either on the phone or on her laptop. Overall, she thinks of herself as fundamen- tally a compassionate woman who has been an attentive mother to her kids.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
