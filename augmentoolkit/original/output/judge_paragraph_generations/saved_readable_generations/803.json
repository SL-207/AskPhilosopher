{"paragraph": " To some, in fact, it might seem that the difficulty in question is so manifest that the belief of the rationalist and the moderate moralist that they can resolve it satisfactorily without rejecting either their egoistic view of rationality or their non-egoistic view of morality can be accounted for only in either of two ways. On one account the belief in question is only an apparent and not an actual belief. On such an account the rationalist and the moderate moralist do not themselves believe that the difficulty in question can be resolved sat\u00ad isfactorily but want so much that others believe that it can be that they present what they secretly know to be spurious arguments in an effort to deceive others into believing that it can be resolved. On such an account, the rationalist and the moderate moralist believe that it is so important that others believe that the requirements of an egoistic view of rationality are completely compatible with, and indeed even coincide with, those of a non-egoistic view of morality that they are justified in resorting to spurious arguments in an effort to deceive others into holding the belief in question. On a second, perhaps more charitable, account the rationalist and the moderate moralist want so much them\u00ad selves to believe.in the truth of what they espouse that in some way they have succeeding in deceiving themselves into believing in the truth of what they say. Having succeeded in deceiving themselves into believing that the requirements of an egoistic view of rationality are compatible or coincide with those of a non-egoistic view of morality, they are per\u00ad fectly sincere in their endeavor to lead others to believe what they them\u00ad selves have succeeded in deceiving themselves into believing. The insuperable difficulty confronting the rationalist and the mod\u00ad erate moralist is escaped by the extreme moralist. He, like the ratio\u00ad nalist and the moderate moralist, accepts an egoistic view of rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
