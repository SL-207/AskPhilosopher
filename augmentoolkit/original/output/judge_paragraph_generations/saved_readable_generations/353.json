{"paragraph": " Not only does Fred fail to know that the Detroit Lions won, but it\u2019s also unreasonable for him to believe that they did. The rational thing for Fred to do is to suspend judgment about who won the game\u2014he shouldn\u2019t believe the Detroit Lions won or believe 5 NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE that they lost. The rational thing is for Fred to not believe one way or other about the outcome of the game until he has some evidence about the score. Although Fred has a true belief about how the game went, he clearly doesn\u2019t know that the Detroit Lions won. Something more is needed for knowledge. This something more is justification. Roughly, justification amounts to having good reasons/evidence to believe something. Fred clearly lacks good reasons/evidence, so he fails to know. (For more discussion of justification, see General Back- ground: The Nature of Justification pp. 113\u2013119.) We can put these insights together to get a precise formulation of the traditional account of knowledge: Someone, S, knows that p if and only if: (1) S believes that p, (2) p is true, and (3) S\u2019s belief that p is justified. 1 PROMOTIONS AND TRAVELING FRIENDS (THE\u00a0GETTIER PROBLEM) Background: In order to appreciate one of the classic \u201cGettier cases\u201d, it is important to keep in mind a particular rule of logic, what is called \u201cdisjunc- tion introduction\u201d. It is the inference rule that says that if p is true, then \u201cp or q\u201d is true. For example, if it is true that you have a dog, then it is also true that you have a dog or a cat. And, it is true that you have a dog or no pet; you have a dog or the moon is made of cheese; and so on. Hence, if it is true that you have a dog, then it is also true that you have a dog or (any claim whatsoever can be plugged in here).
