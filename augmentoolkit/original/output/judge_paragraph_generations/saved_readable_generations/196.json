DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-36 THE MISSING SHADE OF BLUE BACKGROUND Where do our various ideas and concepts come from? Where do we get the concept of dinosaurs, Barack Obama, goodness, or God? Many of them are surely derived from experience. For example, it would be surprising if someone was born with the concept of dinosaurs. Some ideas, though, are more difficult to trace to experiences. This has led some philosophers, at least as early as Plato, to claim that some of our concepts are innate. Plato argued that we have ideas we couldn\u2019t have gotten from experience\u2014we\u2019ve likely never experienced perfectly round circles, but we have the idea of them and know what properties they must have. It\u2019s therefore hypothesized that we were born with these concepts, and they were only triggered by experiences of im- perfect objects. Philosophers of a more empiricist bent tend to argue, on the other hand, that even those concepts come from experience\u2014 perhaps aided by the mental activity of abstraction. John Locke famously argued that the mind was a tabula rasa, a blank slate: whatever ideas we have in our minds come from experience. Several decades later, David Hume adopted a version of this principle, claiming that every idea in the mind is just a copy of some previous sense impressions. Our idea of having pain comes from experiences of 31 The Missing Shade of Blue 191 pain; our idea of redness comes from experiences of red. This \u00adprinciple drives much of Hume\u2019s later skepticism about causality, substance, and the self. Consider causation, for example. Though we can experience a succession of events, we cannot experience the causal relations among them. In cases like these, where we cannot locate a sense impression corresponding to our idea, we must conclude that our idea is some- how flawed.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
