{"paragraph": " And if John's being honest is good, John's being blind bad, and John's having brown eyes neither good nor bad, the first is a good, the second a bad, and the third an indifferent fact. Moreover, since the obtaining of these three states of affairs are facts in the second sense of \"fact\" distinguished above, and since the obtaining of the first is good, that of the second bad, and that of the third neither good nor bad, the first is a good, the second a bad, and the third an indifferent fact. Similarly, since the non-obtaining of the states of affairs consisting of John's being dishonest, John's being sighted, and John's having blue eyes are also facts in the second sense of \"fact,\" and since the non-o braining of the first is good, of the second bad, and of the third neither good nor bad, the first is a good, the second a bad, and the third an indifferent fact. To some it will doubtless seem strange to speak of facts in the above two senses of \"fact\" as being good, bad, or indifferent. Some who find it strange to speak of facts as being good or bad might not find it strange to speak of them as being indifferent since, in believing that facts are neither good nor bad, they might regard all facts as being indifferent in the sense of being neither good nor bad. But if states of affairs that obtain are facts in one sense of \"fact,\" and if some states of affairs that obtain are good, some bad, and some indifferent, then so also are facts in this sense of \"fact\". Similarly, if the obtaining and the non-obtaining of states of affairs are facts in a second sense of \"fact,\" and if the obtaining or the non-obtaining of some states of affairs is good, of some bad, and of some indifferent, then so also are facts in the second sense of \"fact\". The strangeness of speaking of facts in either of the first two senses of \"fact\" as being good, bad, or indifferent might be diminished some\u00ad what if we adopt a different way of speaking.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
