{"paragraph": " Prior to the appearance of bio-Bhavith, it looked like android- Bhavith could be identified with old-Bhavith. But now that bio- Bhavith is on the scene, that identification is called into question. Still, one might be puzzled as to how the existence of bio-Bhavith could change who android-Bhavith is. And it seems weird to think that neither of them is identical to old-Bhavith. As Derek Parfit (1984) has asked, how could double success be a failure? After all, both bio- Bhavith and android-Bhavith seem to have successfully survived. They are both alive and well. In recent philosophical discussion of uploading, philosophers tend to divide into two camps: the optimists and the pessimists. Surveying various upload possibilities, David Chalmers (2010) notes reason for optimism about gradual uploading. If only one of his neurons were replaced by a nanobot, the resulting person would still be him. A sys- tem with only 1% replaced by nanobots, call it Dave1, would still be identical to the original him. And Dave2, after replacement of another 1%, would surely be identical to Dave1, and so on and so on, all the way up to Dave100. So, by transitivity of identity, Dave is identical to Dave100. Interestingly, once we embrace optimism about gradual uploading, we might use that to argue for optimism about the kind of instant uploading we saw in Bhavith\u2019s case. Instant uploading can be understood as gradual uploading in an expedited fashion, and it is hard to see how speeding up a process could change its metaphysical effects. So, if we accept gradual uploading, it looks like we should embrace instant uploading as well. Many pessimists point to worries about reduplication to make their case against uploading. But there are other reasons offered for \u00adpessimism as well. Corabi and Schneider note that, even during a very fast upload, the upload process cannot be instantaneous: \u201cSince infor- mation is being uploaded, the information has to be processed and reassembled in the computer host before anything like a functional Mind Uploading 265 duplicate of the original brain can be obtained\u201d (2012, p.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
