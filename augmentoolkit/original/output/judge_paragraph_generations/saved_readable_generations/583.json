{"paragraph": " Eventually, Henry\u2019s evidence will make the truth of the conjunction of beliefs about the tickets less likely than 95%. In fact, once he gets to the belief that \u201cticket #1 and ticket #2 and ticket #3 and ticket #4 and ticket #5 and ticket #6 lost\u201d it is only 94.15% likely that he is correct. This response claims that because the risks of individual beliefs add up, it is false that when it is rational to believe p and rational to believe q, it must be rational to believe p and q. Thus, in this case Henry can rationally believe of each ticket that it lost, but he can\u2019t rationally put these beliefs together. The final sort of response seeks to retain both NO CONTRA- DICTION and CONJUNCTION by denying SUFFICIENCY. The gist of this way of responding is that p having a sufficiently high probability isn\u2019t enough to make believing p rational (Smith 2010). In other words, there are cases where p has a high probability, but one shouldn\u2019t believe that p. According to this way of responding, Henry is in one of these situations. Although for any given ticket the probability that it lost is 99%, it isn\u2019t rational for Henry to believe that the ticket lost. There are various ways of cashing out this sort of re- sponse. One way of making this response is to simply add a principle that blocks this sort of case. For instance, one might insist that when the truth of a conjunction of otherwise rationally supported beliefs is called into question by a rational belief, then it is not rational to accept any of the beliefs of the conjunction (assuming that the belief that calls the conjunction into doubt doesn\u2019t target specific members of the conjunction) (Ryan 1996). Another route is to deny that purely statistical evidence, of the sort that Henry has, is sufficient to justify belief. Rather, one might contend that something like an explanatory connection between the belief and the fact in the world that makes the belief true is needed (Nelkin 2000).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
