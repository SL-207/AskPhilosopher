{"paragraph": " Thus what rationality requires of us on the first three positions is what morality requires of us on the fourth position, and what morality requires of us on the first three posi\u00ad tions is what rationality requires of us on the fourth position. This is the source of what was referred to above as the \"strangeness\" of the fourth position. It seems to confuse rationality with morality and morality with rationality. What each of the first three positions refers to as \"rationality\" the fourth refers to as \"morality,\" and what the first three label \"morality\" the fourth labels \"rationality\". The fact that the fourth position is a possible position, despite the fact that no one, as far as I know, has ever held it, suggests that the terms \"rationality\" and \"morality\" can be used in significantly different ways. This suggestion is supported by the existence of two other pos\u00ad sible positions. One of these positions, since it holds both an egoistic view of practical rationality and an egoistic view of morality, may be labeled \"unmitigated egoism\". The other, since it holds both a non\u00ad egoistic view of practical rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality, may be labeled \"unmitigated non-egoism\". The unmitigated egoist maintains not only that practical rationality but also morality require that each person act compatibly with the promotion of his own long-term interests. The unmitigated non-egoist, on the other hand, maintains not only that morality but also practical rationality require Morality and Rationality 159 that each person, at least at times, seek as an end something other than the promotion of his long-term interests, such as the promotion of the long-term interests of others affected by his acts and omissions. Thus although the unmitigated egoist and the unmitigated non-egoist dis\u00ad agree on what practical rationality and morality require of us, they agree that what one requires of us is identical with what the other requires.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
