DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-11 THE COFFEE TASTERS BACKGROUND The thought experiment we will consider in this chapter was put forth by Daniel C. Dennett in a paper called \u201cQuining Qualia.\u201d The term \u201cquining\u201d is an homage to 20th-century philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine (1908\u20132000). Starting in 1969 and continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, Dennett published several editions of The Philosophical Lexicon, a humorous compilation of neologisms based on philosophers\u2019 names. \u201cQuining\u201d (used as a verb) was the very first term he coined, and he defined it as follows: \u201cto deny resolutely the existence or importance of something real or significant.\u201d Indeed, the activity of quining was central to Quine\u2019s philosophy.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
