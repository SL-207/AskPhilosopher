{"paragraph": " Chapter 2 is a slightly revised version of a paper, \"Bearers of Value,\" that appeared in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 51 (1991 ). I am grateful to the editor for permission to use that material here. I thank also Oya Kolatu and Lissette Castillo for the excellent work they did in typing the manuscript. Douglas Browning of the Uni\u00ad versity of Texas read an earlier version of the manuscript with the exception of chapters 4, 5, and 10. I am deeply grateful to him for his many insightful and detailed comments and suggestions. I have fol\u00ad lowed some but not all of his suggestions. On certain philosophical issues we disagree. My respect for him as a philosopher, however, is so great that usually when we disagree I come away feeling that he sees things I fail to see. For the many flaws that doubtless remain I alone am responsible, especially in view of the fact that I have not unfailingly fol\u00ad lowed the suggestions he made. As always, my profoundest debt of gratitude is to my wife, to whose memory this book is dedicated, for her unfailing cheerfulness and encouragement over many years and for con\u00ad stantly providing throughout these years absolutely ideal conditions under which to work. One of my deepest regrets is that she did not live to see its completion. ' Chapter 1 Value and Psychological Phenomena One of the central theses of this work is that value is not identical with or reducible to psychological phenomena such as valuing, evaluating, preferring, liking or disliking, taken either singly or in various combi\u00ad nations. In this chapter we shall consider ( 1) some of the differences between value and certain of these phenomena, (2) some of the differ\u00ad ences between such phenomena and some of the relations in which they stand to one another, and (3) different levels of such phenomena. 1. Value, Valuing, and Evaluating The term \"value\" is used in different ways.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
