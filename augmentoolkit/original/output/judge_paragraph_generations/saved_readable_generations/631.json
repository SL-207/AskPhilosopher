{"paragraph": " We do not, of course, use precisely this at least slightly pedantic way of speaking but instead say something such as \"It would be bad if John were dishonest\" or \"It would be good if John were sighted\". In saying that it would be bad if John were dis\u00ad honest we are saying either of two things, depending upon whether ( 1) we believe that it is not the case that he is dishonest or (2) we have no belief either that he is or that he is not dishonest. If we believe that it is not the case that John is dishonest, then in saying that it would be bad if he were dishonest we are saying that it would be bad if he were dis\u00ad honest although in fact he is not. If, however, we have no belief either that John is or that he is not dishonest, then in saying that it would be bad if he were dishonest we are saying that it would be bad if he were dishonest although we do not know and have no belief either that he is or that he is not dishonest. Precisely similar considerations apply to our saying that it would be good if John were sighted. To generalize, to say of any given state of affairs, x, or of any state of affairs, y, that it would be good if x obtained, or bad if y obtained, is to say either ( 1) that it would be good if x obtained, or bad if y obtained, although in fact nei\u00ad ther does or (2) that it would be good if x obtained, or bad if y obtained, although we do not know and have no belief either that they do or that they do not obtain. As I believe the examples given show, we do sometimes distinguish between the obtaining and the non-obtaining of various states of af\u00ad fairs and say of those that do not obtain that it would be good (or bad) if they did obtain. We believe, that is, that the obtaining of certain 24 The Nature of Value states of affairs would be good if they were to obtain and that the ob\u00ad taining of certain other states of affairs would be bad if they were to obtain.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
