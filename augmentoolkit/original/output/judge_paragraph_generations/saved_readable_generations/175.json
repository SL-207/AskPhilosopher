{"paragraph": " I could, presumably, have this same conscious awareness if my brain were simply stimulated in the right way. I could, in fact, be a carefully preserved brain in a vat, hooked up to a computer that stim- ulated the same brain regions that are now (presumably) stimulated by signals from my eyes, ears, and other senses. Things would appear exactly the same way to me if I were a brain in a vat\u2014a BiV for short. I would seem to see my pen and my desk, but there would be no such things; there would only be stimuli coming from a powerful com- puter. Since the world where I am a BiV is, to me, indistinguishable from the world where I am not a BiV, it seems we have a traditional skeptical scenario: I can\u2019t know I\u2019m not a BiV, so I don\u2019t know I\u2019m actually sitting at a desk in front of a computer. Hilary Putnam argued that there is an answer to the BiV skeptical worry based on the way terms gain their meaning. The word \u201cdesk\u201d is just a group of letters or sounds that don\u2019t mean anything intrinsically. The Brain in a Vat 169 If a constellation of stars happened to look like an inscription of the word \u201cdesk,\u201d that constellation wouldn\u2019t thereby refer to desks. Terms gain their meaning by holding a causal connection to things in the world. And the arrangement of stars bears no relevant causal relation to desks. This causal theory of reference complicates the BiV scenario. Suppose I am a BiV. My word \u201cdesk\u201d is not caused by desks. It is caused by the outputs of a computer program. Similarly, my words \u201cbrain\u201d and \u201cvat\u201d are not caused by brains and vats. My statement \u201cI am a brain in a vat\u201d is therefore not true\u2014whatever the words refer to, they don\u2019t refer to brains and vats. So it appears that, in some sense, uttering the sentence \u201cI am a BiV\u201d is self-defeating. So far Putnam\u2019s argument is about language and the way words refer. But, arguably, the case can be extended to thoughts as well.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
