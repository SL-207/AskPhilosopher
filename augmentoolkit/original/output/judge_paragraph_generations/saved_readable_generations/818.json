{"paragraph": " If the nature of something liked is such that the thing liked is intrinsically good, then liking it is also intrinsically good and disliking it intrinsically bad; and if the nature of something disliked is such that the thing disliked is intrinsically bad, then disliking it is intrinsically good and liking it intrinsically bad. Now if anything at all is intrinsically good or bad, unmerited suffering is certainly so, regardless of whose suffering it hap\u00ad pens to be. If anyone understands the meaning of the expressions \"intrinsically good,\" \"intrinsically bad,\" and \"unmerited suffering,\" yet denies or doubts that unmerited suffering is intrinsically bad, I do not know what would convince him that it is indeed bad other than, perhaps, his undergoing such suffering himself. It is because such suf\u00ad fering is intrinsically bad that anyone's liking another's undergoing it is itself intrinsically bad and that anyone's disliking another's undergoing it is itself intrinsically good. Although someone's liking or disliking another's undergoing such suffering might also be extrinsically good or bad, depending upon what the consequences of such liking and dis\u00ad liking are, such liking and disliking are still intrinsically good or bad regardless of what their consequences might be. Since, then, likings and dislikings can themselves be intrinsically good or bad, the concepts of intrinsically good and intrinsically bad cannot be replaced with the con\u00ad cepts of liking and disliking. 4. Unmitigated Non-Egoism If the argument of the previous section is acceptable, then unmitigated egoism is unacceptable. And since the positions referred to above as ra\u00ad tionalism, moderate moralism, and extreme moralism, and the position that holds an egoistic view of morality and a non-egotistic view of ra\u00ad tionality, are all confronted with various of the difficulties indicated above, unmitigated non-egoism remains as the only acceptable alterna\u00ad tive.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
