{"paragraph": " So, assuming that they don\u2019t have undefeated defeaters, phenomenal conservatism is committed to claiming that both of them are justified in believing that the pebble is gold. Yet, it may seem that Peter shouldn\u2019t believe that the pebble is gold. If Peter shouldn\u2019t be- lieve that the pebble is gold, it appears that phenomenal conservatism may be in serious trouble. RESPONSES One response to this sort of case is to accept that both Patricia and \u00adPeter are justified in believing that the pebble is gold \u00ad(Huemer 2013b). The thought here is that it doesn\u2019t matter what causes a seeming, all that matters is that one has the seeming. That said, one way of fleshing out this sort of response yields the result that even though each of their seemings provide justification, only Patricia is ultimately justified in believing that the pebble is gold. This way of taking the response argues that although Peter\u2019s seeming provides justification, his justification is defeated by other things he knows (Huemer 2013a). For example, Peter knows that he isn\u2019t an expert JUSTIFICATION 160 and that he can\u2019t tell whether something is gold rather than fool\u2019s gold simply by looking. As a result of these undefeated defeaters, this response insists, the justification, which Peter\u2019s seeming really does supply, is defeated. Hence, Patricia has justification for believing that the pebble is gold and Peter doesn\u2019t\u2014but this isn\u2019t a problem for phenomenal conservatism. Another response is to contend that while both Patricia and \u00adPeter are justified in believing that the pebble is gold, only Patricia is war- ranted in doing so (Tucker 2011, Huemer 2013a). Recall from A Vis- itor from the Swamp (pp. 139\u2013143) that warrant is stipulated to be the property that turns true belief into knowledge. In other words, war- rant encompasses both justification and whatever is necessary to solve the Gettier Problem. The thinking with this response is that although both Patricia and Peter are justified in believing that the pebble is gold, only Patricia would know that it is (assuming that it is true that the pebble is gold).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
