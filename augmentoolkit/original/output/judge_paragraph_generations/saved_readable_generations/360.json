{"paragraph": " There are various versions of causal theories of knowledge. However, the general idea is that a causal theory of knowledge replaces justification with an \u201cappropriate\u201d causal con- nection. One of the first and simplest versions of a causal theory of knowl- edge was put forward by Alvin Goldman. It says that S knows that p if and only if (1) S believes p, (2) p is true, and (3) the fact that p is appropriately causally connected with S\u2019s believing that p. One way that the fact that p could be causally connected with S\u2019s believing that p is for that fact to be a cause of her believing as she does. For example, the fact that there is a tree in the yard is part of the causal story for why S believes that there is a tree in the yard when she\u2019s gazing out a window overlooking the yard. Another way that the fact that p could be causally connected with S\u2019s believing that p is for her believing and the fact that p to have a common cause. An example of this might be S\u2019s belief that there is smoke coming out of the chimney because she is inside and sees the fire. In such a case, a common cause of her belief and the fact that smoke is coming out of the chimney is the fire in the fireplace. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to say precisely what counts as an \u201cappropriate\u201d causal connection and what doesn\u2019t. Fortunately for our purposes, we don\u2019t need an exact account of appropriateness in this sense. CAUSAL THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 13 EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE; CAUSAL THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE Detective Skyrms has just arrived at the scene of a potential crime. Upon arriving, he immediately notices a body and the severed head that belongs to that body a few feet away. Skyrms, as would anyone else, immediately forms the true belief that the person is dead based upon what he sees. As with the Gettier cases discussed in the previous entry though, the story here isn\u2019t quite so simple.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
