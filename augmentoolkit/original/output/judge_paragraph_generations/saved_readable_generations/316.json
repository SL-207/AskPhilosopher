{"paragraph": " Oreo, and Narrative Conceptions of the Self 305 reality. For example, it is not clear how exactly to assess the case of Mr. Oreo in light of the reality constraint. Many philosophers working on issues relating to gender and ra- cial identity explicitly adopt a narrative framework. In a discussion of transitions from one sex or gender to another, Christine Overall argues that we develop our gender identities \u201cby, in effect, creating the continuing narrative of our lives\u201d (2009, p. 21). Fran\u04aboise Baylis makes the connection to narrativity explicit in talking about her own racial identity: \u201cMy life is a collection of stories (mine and those of significant others) that tells me where I am from, where I have been and where I am going\u201d (2003, p. 145). Interestingly, Baylis herself can be seen as a reverse case from that of Mr. Oreo. Though Baylis has very light skin, and is generally taken to be white, she considers herself black. As she notes, from a very young age, she deliberately incorpo- rated her racial identity into her own self-narrative, something that wasn\u2019t always easy: \u201cBuilding a Black identity is hard work when you have white skin\u201d (2003, p. 144). A narrative framework also works well in discussion of online identities. One\u2019s narrative about oneself might blend facts from one\u2019s real life in the (physical) world and one\u2019s virtual life through an avatar in an online world (Schechtman 2012). Despite the merits of the narrative view, it has faced criticism along various dimensions. One significant challenge comes from the exist- ence of people who don\u2019t view their lives in narrative terms. Calling himself an \u201cepisodic\u201d person, Galen Strawson denies that his own life exhibits narrativity\u2014rather, it is just a series of relatively disconnected episodes. As he describes it: I have a past, like any human being, and I know perfectly well that I have a past. I have a respectable amount of factual knowledge about it, and I also remember some of my past experiences \u201cfrom the inside,\u201d as philos- ophers say.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
