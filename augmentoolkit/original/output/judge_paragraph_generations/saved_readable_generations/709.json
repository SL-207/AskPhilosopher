{"paragraph": " To determine the total value of an objective it is necessary that one consider not only its intrinsic value and any contributory value it might have but also any instrumental value it might have. Leaving aside for the sake of simplicity any contributory value a given objective might have, its total value is ( 1) positive if its positive intrinsic value is greater than its negative instrumental value or if its positive instrumental value is greater than its negative intrinsic value, (2) negative if its negative intrinsic value is greater than its positive instrumental value or if its negative instrumental value is greater than its positive intrinsic value. 84 The Nature of Value Thus in a given situation the positive intrinsic value of acting compat\u00ad ibly with some person's acquiring or retaining something, x, to which he has a right, might be greater than the negative instrumental value of doing so. If so, then in that situation his right to x is not overridden by the negative instrumental value of our acting compatibly with his acquiring or retaining x, and we have an absolute duty to do so and can act rightly and as we ought only by doing so. If, however, a situation is such that the negative instrumental value of our acting compatibly with his acquiring of retaining x, which might be due to the fact that our doing so would violate some weightier tight of some other person or the same right of two or more others, is greater than the positive intrinsic value of our doing so, then his right to x is overridden, so that in that situation we have an absolute duty and thus act rightly and as we ought only if we act incompatibly with his acquiring or retaining x. From this it is evident that the right in question is only prima facia. From the fact, however, that most rights are only prima facia it does not follow that there are no absolutely unconditional rights, such as the right to equality of consideration or the right to do one's duty, that cannot under any conditions be overridden.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
