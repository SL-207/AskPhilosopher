{"paragraph": " But there doesn\u2019t seem to be any alternative. Explaining the bat\u2019s experiences objectively, without \u00adimagining them accurately, wouldn\u2019t reveal what they\u2019re really like. Indeed, such an explanation would not, it seems, bring us any closer to understanding their distinctive nature. A human bat scientist\u2014a chiropterologist\u2014might know the complete neuroscientific truth about the bat\u2019s brain, and yet be no less mystified than other humans about what it\u2019s like for the bat to echolocate. The problem generalizes. Conscious experiences are subjective: there\u2019s something they\u2019re like for the experiencing subject. How, then, could they really be wholly explicable in objective terms, as physicalism seems to imply? DISCUSSION Importantly, Nagel does not take these considerations to show that physicalism is false. (This differentiates the bat argument from Frank Jackson\u2019s knowledge argument, which will we consider in Chapter 6.) Rather, he conceives of the problem for physicalism as concerning not so much whether physicalism is true but how we can understand its truth. In Nagel\u2019s view, based only on what is presently known, we can\u2019t understand how physicalism could be true. CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 28 What does that mean? Nagel explains by drawing an analogy. Im- agine a current-day physicist time-travels to ancient Greece. She finds a philosopher there (Thales, say), and tells him that matter is energy\u2014 something that was discovered in the 20th century. Suppose Thales has good reason to believe the scientist, and that he therefore accepts her statement that matter is energy as the truth. But does he under- stand the truth that the statement expresses? Does he even understand how matter could be energy? No. Understanding how matter could be energy requires knowledge of the general theory of relativity, and this is knowledge that Thales lacks. Nagel suggests that we\u2019re in a similar situation with respect to phys- icalism.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
