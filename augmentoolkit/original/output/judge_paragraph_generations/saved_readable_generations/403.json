{"paragraph": " It seems so. After all, couldn\u2019t the demon, with its god-like powers, cause you to have pretty much any sort of perceptual experience that it wanted? Presumably, you don\u2019t think that you are actually being deceived by a demon of the sort that Descartes described. But, why not? Things would look, feel, smell, sound, and taste exactly as they do now, whether things are as you take them to be or you are deceived by Descartes\u2019 demon. Since everything would seem the same, what grounds could you have for thinking that CARTESIAN/EXTERNAL WORLD SKEPTICISM 57 the world is as you normally think it is instead of that you are tricked by a demon? (Of course, nothing in particular hinges on the idea that it is a demon that is doing the deceiving here\u2014the possibility that we are experiencing a computer simulation such as that depicted in the movie The Matrix or the possibility that we are simply brains in vats can do the same work as the demon that Descartes discusses.) Now we face a serious problem. If you don\u2019t have grounds for thinking that the world is as you typically take it to be rather than that the world is one in which you are being deceived by a demon, it seems that you don\u2019t have good reasons to believe the things you normally do about the world around you. It appears that we face a very strong argument for skepticism here. To make the argument that Descartes\u2019 demon supports clearer, here is a simple formulation of it: 1) You don\u2019t know that you\u2019re not deceived by Descartes\u2019 demon. 2) If you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re not deceived by Descartes\u2019 demon, then you don\u2019t know anything about the world around you. 3) \u0007Therefore, you don\u2019t know anything about the world around you. RESPONSES One response to Descartes\u2019 demon is to simply accept skepticism. That is, one might grant that it is impossible for us to have reasons to think that we aren\u2019t being deceived by such a demon. And so, one might accept that because of this possibility, we lack knowledge of the world around us.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
