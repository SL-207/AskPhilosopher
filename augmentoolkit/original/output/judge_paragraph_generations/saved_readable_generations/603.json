{"paragraph": " Some of these uses will be of no interest to us here. We shall not, for example, be interested in its use to refer to the truth-value of propositions. Nor shall we be concerned with its use to refer to the value of a variable, as when it is said that the value of the variable \"x\" in \"1 + x = 3\" is 2. There are, however, at least three uses of the term and its cognates in which we shall be interested. In one of these uses it is used as a verb, as in \"I value a,\" \"you value b,\" and \"he values c\". In a second it is used as an adjective, as in \"xis valu\u00ad able\". In a third it is used as a noun, as in \"Some of John's values are a, b, and c,\" in which the values of the variables \"a,\" \"b,\" and \"c\" are some of the things John values. In this third sense of the term it is the things themselves valued by a person that constitute the values of that person. Such things are valuable or have value, at least for the person who values them, but they themselves, as values of the person, are dis\u00ad tinct from the value they have for him. They are his values in the sense that he values them. In addition to valuing various things, a person can also evaluate 1 2 The Nature of Value things. Evaluating a thing is different from valuing it. In evaluating something a person is not valuing it but instead is endeavoring to deter\u00ad mine its value or at least to ascertain whether he, and perhaps also others, ought to value it and, if he concludes that he, and again perhaps also others, ought to value it, to determine the degree to which he, and perhaps also they, ought to do so. Evaluating some object of evaluation presupposes that the value, if any, it has and the degree of its value are independent of whether one already values it. Thus one can value an object without evaluating it, and one can evaluate an object without already valuing it. The evaluation of things by human beings has been a persistent and widespread practice throughout the course of human his\u00ad tory, and unless things have value independently of their being evalu\u00ad ated this practice would rest on a persistent and widespread illusion and would have little or no point.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
