{"paragraph": " Thus, the psychological theory seems to rule out the possibility that we were once fetuses (Olson 1997). And some consider that a flaw in the theory. To turn to one last worry, consider contemporary research that suggests that memory and other psychological states are considerably more embodied than Locke seems to have thought. In cases of severe The Prince and the Cobbler 245 trauma, for example, memory does not seem to be purely a psycholog- ical state. Traumatic flashbacks are often experienced as bodily states. When we consider this kind of case, we\u2019re led to the conclusion that memories reside in the body; one might even be inclined to say\u00a0that the body remembers the trauma (Brison 2002). Thus, the notion that\u00a0we can wholly separate psychological facts from physical facts as the psychological theory suggests has struck many as implausible.
