{"paragraph": " It\u2019s still true to say that there are selves, just as it\u2019s true that there are sundials. But that truth doesn\u2019t reflect anything deep about the world\u2014only about our way of conceptualizing it. Given the distinction between natural and conventional kinds, the analogy of the chariot suggests a couple of ways to resist the Bud- dhist no-self view. One is to deny that the cases are analogous\u2014that perhaps the chariot isn\u2019t a natural kind but the self is. The other is to grant they are analogous, but to also say that, in any sense that matters, they both exist. One way to get at the idea that the self is different from the chariot is to say that what constitutes a chariot is conventional in a way the self is not (Van Inwagen 1990, Merricks 2001). So, for example, is a car a chariot? What if it is pulled by horses? Suppose you remove a chariot\u2019s wheels\u2014is it still a chariot? What if you replace the wheels with hovering drones? Suppose you lash two chariots together and combine parts. At any point are they one chariot? In cases like these, it\u2019s tempting to say that there is no deep fact of the matter: what counts as a chariot is purely conventional. Is the same thing true of a self? Suppose you cut your hair. Is there still a self there? Suppose you forget how to ride a bike, get a tumor resected, and lose your arms and legs. Is there still a self there? (Note the question is not the ques- tion we discuss in Chapter 39 about whether you are the same self or person before and after these events; the question is whether there is a self there at all.) What if you are shot in the head and lose life and consciousness? If you have a surgeon stitch you to your best friend, is there one self there or two? Here it might seem the answers are not a matter of convention. Except in the case where you are shot in the head, there is still a self there. When you are sewn to your friend, assuming your brains aren\u2019t mixed together, there are still two selves there.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
