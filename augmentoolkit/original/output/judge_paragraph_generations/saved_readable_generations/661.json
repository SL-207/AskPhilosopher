{"paragraph": " Thus given that John has done something the doing of which makes him deserve to suffer punishment, it is better that he suffer the punishment he deserves than that he not suffer it even though the whole consisting of his doing the thing in question and his suffering the punishment he deserves is itself bad. 3 In situations of the sort we have been considering, if two parts of a given whole are such that one is intrinsically good and the other is intrinsically bad, the intrinsic value of the whole is positive if the posi\u00ad tive intrinsic value of its good part is greater than the negative intrinsic value of its bad part, negative if the negative intrinsic value of its bad part is greater than the positive intrinsic value of its good part. This, however, does not mean that the intrinsic value of a whole is positive if it has more intrinsically good than intrinsically bad parts, negative if it has more intrinsically bad than intrinsically good parts. Instead, the intrinsic value of a whole consisting of three or more parts is deter\u00ad mined by considering what may be referred to as the combined positive intrinsic value of its good parts and the combined negative intrinsic value of its bad parts. Even though a whole has a greater number of intrinsically good than intrinsically bad parts, the combined negative intrinsic value of its bad parts might be greater than the combined pos\u00ad itive intrinsic value of its good parts. If it is, then the whole itself is intrinsically bad. If, however, the combined positive intrinsic value of the good parts is neither greater nor less than the combined negative intrinsic value of the bad parts, the intrinsic value of the whole is neither positive nor negative, which is to say that it is neither intrinsically good nor intrinsically bad. There are cases of other types, however, to which the preceding does not apply. In these cases a given whole can be intrinsically bad even though the combined positive intrinsic value of its good parts is greater than the combined negative intrinsic value of its bad parts and, indeed, even though each of its parts, taken in isolation from the other parts and from the whole of which they are parts, is intrinsically good.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
