DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-47 THE BODY-SWAP PUZZLE BACKGROUND As we saw in our discussion of the Prince and the Cobbler in \u00adChapter 39, body-swap cases are often invoked in discussions of personal \u00adidentity time (see also the brain transplant cases discussed in Shoe- maker 1963). In everyday life, facts about psychological continuity and bodily continuity tend to go together. Typically, if there is phys- ical continuity between a person P1 on Monday and a person P2 on \u00adTuesday, then there will also be psychological continuity between P1 and P2. The reverse is also true: Typically, if there is psychological continuity between P1 on Monday and P2 on Tuesday, then there will also be physical continuity between P1 and P2. In body-swap cases, when the consciousness associated with one person is trans- ferred into the body associated with another person, psychological continuity and physical continuity come apart. When considering such cases, most people tend to think that the psychological facts have primary importance in determining personal identity. As this is some- times put, we tend to think that a person goes where their psychology goes.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
