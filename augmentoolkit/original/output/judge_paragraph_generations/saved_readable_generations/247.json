{"paragraph": " Chapter 46 returns to issues that arose in connection with the Buddhist no-self view discussed in Chapter 40; in particular, it explores a puzzle about our ability to have intro- spective access to the self. Chapter 47 turns from questions about self-introspection to questions about self-reference, objectivity, and self-awareness. The final three chapters in this section turn to questions about the essence of persons and the self. Chapter 48 considers a thought experiment designed to show that the origins of a person are es- sential to that person\u2019s identity. Chapter 49 considers which kinds of characteristics are especially salient towards making a person the person that they are. Finally, Chapter 50 explores how cases involving transformative decisions raise problems for a person\u2019s ability to stay true to themselves.

Ad- dressing the topic in a chapter entitled \u201cOf Identity and Diversity\u201d in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689), Locke took up two inter-related questions: First, what is the nature of persons? And, second, what accounts for a person\u2019s identity over time? Our interest in this chapter is the second question, and the issue of personal iden- tity over time is now often referred to as the problem of personal identity. Philosophers working on this problem have typically split into three broad camps. Those who defend the soul theory suggest that a person\u2019s identity over time consists in the continued existence of the same soul. Those who defend the psychological theory suggest that a person\u2019s identity over time consists in psychological facts. Those who defend the physical theory suggest that a person\u2019s identity over time consists in physical facts.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
