{"paragraph": " Thus a person's wishing that some undeserved evil befall another person contributes to making the world at least slightly worse than it would otherwise be even though his having that wish has no effect on anything at all and thus no instrumental value at all. Even, however, when the obtaining of some state of affairs does have some instrumental value, the contributory value of its obtaining might be greater than its instrumental value. Thus the performance from compassion of some simple supererogatory act of giving a dollar to a beggar might have greater positive contributory than instrumental value were the beggar alcoholic and uses it to buy another bottle of cheap wine. It is only, however, when taken simply in relation to the world, the most comprehensive whole of which it is a part, that the contributory value of an objective is determined completely by its intrinsic value. In relation to less comprehensive wholes its contributory value can be determined only by considering also the other parts of the whole and the whole of which they are parts. Thus the contributory value of an act of keeping a promise can be determined only by considering its relation to the act of making the promise and to the whole consisting of both acts. Other things equal, a whole consisting of an act of making a promise and an act of breaking it is intrinsically worse than one con\u00ad sisting of the same first part and an act of keeping it. Since the two wholes have the same first part, the second whole can be better than the first only because of a difference between the second parts, so that the second part of the second whole has some positive contributory value regardless of whether it also has any intrinsic value. It also has positive contributory value relative to the whole in question even though it has negative instrumental value, as it would have were its consequences worse than those of breaking the promise would be.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
