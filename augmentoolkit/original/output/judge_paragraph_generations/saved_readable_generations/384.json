{"paragraph": " Nevertheless, Geoff does dispositionally believe them, and it is dispositional belief that is required for knowl- edge. Hence, this response also maintains that this sort of case fails to show that knowledge doesn\u2019t require belief. A final response seeks to employ the distinction between proposi- tional justification (having good reasons to believe that p) and doxastic justification (believing that p for good reasons) in order to analyze what is going on in cases like \u201cThe Quiz Show\u201d (see the background for Saul the Superstitious Lawyer pp. 42\u201347 for more on propositional justification vs. doxastic justification). The general idea with this re- sponse is that an analogous distinction applies to knowledge (Veber 2014). Once this distinction is extended to knowledge, we end up with two kinds of knowledge\u2014propositional and doxastic\u2014and only NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 36 the latter requires belief. Thus, given this response, it is true that Geoff knows without belief because he only has propositional knowledge, and this kind of knowledge doesn\u2019t require belief. Yet, this doesn\u2019t show that the traditional account of knowledge is false because some knowledge (the doxastic variety) does require belief.
