{"paragraph": " In fact, lottery skeptical challenges arise from consideration of things that we actu- ally know occur in real life. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: LOTTERY SKEPTICISM Imagine you\u2019ve just purchased a lottery ticket for the Mega Millions Lottery. The odds of your winning are quite low (for example, the odds of winning the January 2018 drawing of this lottery were about 302.6 million to 1). Despite the low odds, do you know that you won\u2019t win? It doesn\u2019t seem so. After all, you know how bad the odds of winning the lottery are before you bought the ticket, so if the odds are such that you can know that you\u2019ll lose, why did you waste your money? It seems that rather than knowing that you won\u2019t win, you know that it is extremely unlikely that you\u2019ll win. This isn\u2019t very inter- esting to think about on its own. However, now consider something LOTTERY SKEPTICISM 81 it seems (assuming that you aren\u2019t already rich) you do know\u2014you won\u2019t be able to purchase a new Lamborghini Aventador S Roadster (if you\u2019re in the market for a car and curious, the MSRP for the 2020 model starts at $460,427). But, wait! If you were to win the lottery, you could afford to buy this car because you would have millions of dollars. We have a puzzle here. It seems you don\u2019t know that you won\u2019t win the lottery, but it also seems that you do know that you won\u2019t have the money to buy a new Lamborghini. And at the same time, you know that if you did win the lottery, you would have the money to buy a new Lamborghini. What are we to make of this? While the lottery scenario we just discussed is interesting, you may not find it all that troublesome because you may never buy lottery tickets. However, we can\u2019t simply set this aside as a mere curiosity. There are skeptical arguments that arise from similar considerations, and these arguments threaten our knowledge of many of the things we ordinarily take ourselves to know.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
