{"paragraph": " This\u00a0position on disagreement is often motivated by criticizing the equal weight view. One ground for denying the equal weight view is SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY 194 that there is something special about the evidence that a person has (Huemer 2011). For instance, the evidence Asa has for thinking that everyone owes $20 is on stronger grounds for her than the evidence she gains from learning that Pedro disagrees with her. The reason for this is that Asa has direct access to her evidence in a way that she doesn\u2019t to the evidence that Pedro provides. Others object to the equal weight view on the basis of the ration- ality of self-trust (Enoch 2010, Zagzebski 2012). They maintain that trust in your own reasoning and cognitive faculties is of fundamental importance for rationality. They go on to insist that trusting yourself amounts to remaining steadfast in your belief when it is discovered that an epistemic peer disagrees. Thus, Asa and Pedro should remain steadfast in their beliefs because they are rational to trust themselves. Yet another ground for objecting to the equal weight view has to do with what is known as the uniqueness thesis (see You Only Believe that Because\u2026 pp. 85\u201389). The uniqueness thesis is the idea that given a set of evidence, E, there is only one uniquely justified position to take with respect to p. In other words, uniqueness holds that for an- yone who has E, the same attitude toward p is justified. Some, how- ever, deny uniqueness. Instead, they accept permissivism, which allows that the same set of evidence can support different justified attitudes toward p (Kelly 2014). Given permissivism, it may be that in at least some cases of peer disagreement, both peers are rational in continuing to hold their beliefs in spite of their disagreement. There are other views that lie between the extremes of the equal weight view, which basically says that whenever you discover disagreement with a peer that gives you a defeater for your justification, and the steadfast view, which basically says that in general, discovering disagreement doesn\u2019t give you a defeater for your justification.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
