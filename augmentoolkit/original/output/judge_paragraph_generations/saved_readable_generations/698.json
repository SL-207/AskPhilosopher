{"paragraph": " Given the preceding, the concept of ought, in the strict moral sense of the term, can be explicated in terms of the concepts of duty and of right\u00ad ness and wrongness. The claim that in a given situation a person has a given prima f acie duty entails the claim that he ought to fulfill it unless it is overridden by some weightier conflicting prima f acie duty or coun\u00ad tered by some conflicting prima f acie duty of equal weight. Similarly, the claim that in a given situation a person has a given absolute duty entails the claim that he ought to fulfill it. From this it follows that the claim that in a given situation a person can act rightly only by performing a given act, or any one of two or more acts, entails the claim that he ought to do so. And the claim that in a given situation a person would act wrongly were he to act in a certain way entails the claim that he ought not to act in that way. The concepts of duty and of rightness and wrong\u00ad ness are therefore more fundamental than the concept of ought even though the claim that in a given situation a person ought to perform a given act also entails the claim that it is his duty to perform it and that he must do so if he is to act rightly. This is the case because he ought to perform such acts because it is his duty to do so and he must do so if he is to act rightly, but such acts are not his duty and it is not necessary that he perform them if he is to act rightly because he ought so to do. The sit\u00ad uation here is analogous to that discussed in the first section of the 76 The Nature of Value previous chapter concerning the mutual entailment of a proposition p to the effect that a given thing, x, is intrinsically good and a proposition q to the effect that its existence or occurrence is preferable in itself to its non-existence or non-occurrence. Although p and q mutually entail each other, q is true because p is true but not vice versa.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
