For instance, observing a black raven confirms (to at least some degree) the hypothesis that all ravens are black. Although there are various principles of confirmation that seem obviously true, when they are combined apparent paradoxes arise. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: RAVENS PARADOX/ CONFIRMATION PARADOX Here\u2019s something that seems true. If some evidence confirms (i.e. supports/makes more likely to be true) a particular hypothesis, H1, then that evidence equally confirms any hypothesis, H2, that is log- ically equivalent to H1.
