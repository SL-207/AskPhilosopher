PART III CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION Introduction It seems to be an essential feature of minds that they think, and it seems to be an essential feature of thinking that it is about something. Sarah can think her grandmother is stylish. She can hope that she inherits her grandmother\u2019s fancy shawls. She can remember the first time she beat her grandmother at gin rummy. All of these thoughts have what philosophers call intentionality: they are about something. By having these thoughts, Sarah represents the world as being a certain way. Sarah\u2019s thoughts are about inheriting shawls, beating her grand- mother at rummy, and so on. The thought\u2019s content is what the thought represents as being the case. In many cases, the content of a thought is what philosophers call a proposition. Propositions are, roughly, the things designated by that-clauses. For example, Sarah believes that her grandmother was born in Peoria, Illinois. This thing Sarah believes\u2014 that her grandmother was born in Peoria\u2014could be true or it could be false. This is a crucial feature of propositions\u2014that they can be true or false. One can take many different stances or attitudes toward the same content or proposition. Sarah could doubt that her grandmother was born in Peoria, she could wonder whether her grandmother was born in Peoria, she could hope it, and so on. These are all propositional attitudes. They are attitudes that have propositions as their content. DOI: 10.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
