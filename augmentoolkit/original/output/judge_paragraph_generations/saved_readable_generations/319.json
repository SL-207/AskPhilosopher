{"paragraph": " Calculating expected value will often be difficult. But, 50 PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 308 as the cases of transformative experience we\u2019ll consider in this chapter bring into focus, sometimes it seems not just difficult but impossible. So, the possibility of making a rational decision is threatened. Moreo- ver, knowing expected values seems important not just for our deci- sions to be rational but for them to be authentic\u2014that is, for ensuring that we are able to stay true to ourselves. Thus, as we\u2019ll see, the puzzle of transformative choice raises a threat not just about rationality but about our ability to shape ourselves into the kinds of future selves that we want to be. THE CASE Consider Blythe, a woman who is about to travel to Malaysia for the first time. When talking with her friends about what she should do while she is there, one of them suggests trying durian, a local fruit. This suggestion proves extremely divisive. While they all agree that it smells awful, about half of them say that the taste is sublime and shouldn\u2019t be missed, while the other half say that it\u2019s absolutely ter- rible. When Blythe does some research, she finds that it\u2019s not just her friends who are split on the matter. She comes across an essay from Alfred Russel Wallace that describes the durian as having an exquisite flavor unparalleled by other fruit; according to Wallace, eating it offers \u201ca new sensation worth a voyage to the East to experience.\u201d But, on the other hand, Blythe also reads a post from a travel blogger who describes the smell as a blend of onion and sweaty socks, and goes on to say that \u201cthe durian tasted how it smelled, only worse. I was done.\u201d When Blythe finally encounters durian at a local market, she\u2019s not sure whether to try it or not. Though she has read lots of descriptions of its flavor, she still doesn\u2019t know what tasting durian is like, and so she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019d be getting into.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
