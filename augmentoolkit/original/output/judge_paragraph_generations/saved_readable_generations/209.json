{"paragraph": " It could be that how a particular swatch seems depends on what else is seen with it. When S1 is side by side with S2, they seem the same, and both S1 and S2 generate qualitatively identical seemings. The same is true when S2 is seen next to S3. But there is no single way S2 seems. When S2 is compared to S1, it generates the seeming S*2 (which is qualitatively identical to S*1), but when it is compared to S3 it gen- erates the seeming S**2 (which is qualitatively identical to S*2). This line of reasoning, which we can call the contextual seemings view, blocks the argument because there is no single seeming that is qualitatively identical with S*1 and S*3. Despite its success in blocking the swatches argument, the contex- tual seemings view might be unsatisfying to some. The problem is that the seemings don\u2019t really seem to change from context to context. S2 itself arguably doesn\u2019t seem to change from context to context\u2014we don\u2019t feel we are looking at a slightly different color depending on what it is compared to. Perhaps we just don\u2019t notice the shift in seem- ings, but then it turns out that we are fallible about those seemings after all. That\u2019s not necessarily a problem for the view\u2014the theory of seem- ings can drop the claim that all judgments about seemings are infallible. The idea that we have seemings but have fallible access to them receives support from another thought experiment (Chisholm 1942). Suppose you are looking at a speckled hen with 40 speckles. You can clearly be wrong, at least at a glance, about whether there are 40 speckles. But, according to the theory of seemings, you have an image of a speckled hen that you can\u2019t be wrong about. Now consider your image: how many speckles are in your image? Even if you counted or were willing to hazard a guess as to the number of speckles in your image, it seems clear that you could easily be wrong. The theory of seemings is therefore false: there are no mental images or seemings you cannot be wrong about.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
