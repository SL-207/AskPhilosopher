{"paragraph": " We need not multiply examples further. The reader will be able to supply in abundance other examples, each illustrating the fact that we regard it as good that certain states of affairs obtain because it is normal for them to obtain and as bad that certain others obtain because it is not normal for them to do so. The examples given, as well as many others that could be adduced, are sufficient, I believe, to show that we frequently regard being normal as good. We frequently regard it as good that instances of certain kinds are normal instances of their kind, and we also sometimes regard a normal or typical instance of a given kind as being a good instance of its kind. As was suggested above, this is indicated in the case of bodily normalities and abnormalities by our speaking of typical instances of a species as being well-formed and of abnormal instances as being badly formed, deformed, or malformed. The goodness of the normal has fre\u00ad quently been neglected by value theorists, who sometimes write as though they believe that an instance of a kind can be a good instance of its kind only if it is a better instance than most instances. To be a better instance of a kind than most instances of that kind is, of course, to be a good instance of that kind. This, however, does not mean that typical or normal instances of that kind are not also good instances. To be a good instance of certain kinds it suffices to be a typical or normal instance. Although to be better than most instances of a kind is to be better than most good instances of the kind, it is not always necessary that an instance be better than most good instances if it is to be a good instance. To recognize and appreciate the goodness of the normal is to recog\u00ad nize and appreciate the way the world and the things in it, especially the living things, normally are. A normal accompaniment of such recogni\u00ad tion and appreciation is a certain satisfaction and contentment with the way the world and the things in it, again especially the living things, normally are.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
