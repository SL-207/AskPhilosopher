{"paragraph": " However, Kai is also very tired many days because he spends so much time staying up late thinking about philosophy. One day, the professor presents the class (including Kai) a logical principle L. She doesn\u2019t tell them whether the principle is true or not, but instead she asks them to reflect upon it to see if it is knowable a priori (i.e. by reflection alone). Kai has never thought of this principle before, but he dutifully sets to thinking long and hard about the principle and whether it is true. After several minutes of focused attention on L, it strikes Kai that the principle seems clearly true. As a result of this intellectual seeming (what we might call an \u201cintuition\u201d), Kai believes that L is true. For the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s assume that such an intellectual seeming is sufficiently good evidence to justify Kai in believing that L is true, and let\u2019s assume that L is true and Kai is not in some sort of strange Gettier-style situation. So, Kai justifiedly believes that L, in fact he knows it. He tells his professor that L is true and how he can see that it is so. Unfortunately, before he can receive the praise he rightly deserves, he falls into a deep sleep. The hard work that Kai put in to thinking about L coupled with his exhaustion from another long night phi- losophizing was just too much for him. His sleep is so deep that he is not even dreaming. While Kai is asleep, his professor tells another professor (pointing at the sleeping Kai), \u201che knows that L is true.\u201d It seems pretty intuitive that the professor speaks truly when she says of Kai that he knows L while he\u2019s sleeping. However, it\u2019s not clear what evidence Kai has for his belief that L in this case. If Kai really does know L while in a dreamless sleep and he doesn\u2019t have evidence for L while in this state, then evidentialism and other theories that require evidence for justification are in deep trouble.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
