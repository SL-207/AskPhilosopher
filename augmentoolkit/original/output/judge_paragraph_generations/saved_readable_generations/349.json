{"paragraph": " After you share this information about your dog, Fred will know a lot of facts about her. But, Fred doesn\u2019t know your dog. After all, Fred has never seen your dog or interacted NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 2 with her in any way. You know your dog in a way that Fred does not. You have acquaintance knowledge of your dog; Fred doesn\u2019t. Knowledge-how is different from acquaintance knowledge, and it at least seems to be different from knowledge of facts. Knowledge-how is the sort of knowledge common of abilities or skills. You know how to swim. You know how to throw a baseball. And so on. Know- ing how to do something is different from having acquaintance knowledge, and it seems different from merely knowing facts. For instance, you might know all sorts of facts about how to swim and yet be in danger of drowning if you\u2019re ever thrown into deep \u00adwater! Conversely, you might be an excellent swimmer but completely in- capable of expressing your ability to swim in terms of facts about swimming. (Relatively recently, a debate has emerged concerning whether knowledge-how reduces to knowledge of facts, but we can set that aside for now\u2014traditionally the two have been taken to be different.) Propositional knowledge (which we will simply refer to as \u201cknowl- edge\u201d in the entries that follow) is knowledge of facts. This knowledge is called \u201cpropositional\u201d because we mentally represent (think about) facts by way of thinking of propositions. In simplest terms propositions are what declarative sentences mean. Consider these three declarative sentences: \u201cThe dog is brown\u201d, \u201cEl perro es cafe\u201d, and \u201cDer Hund ist braun\u201d. These three sentences are all declarative, but they are very different. They contain different words, and they are in different lan- guages (English, Spanish, and German, respectively). However, they all mean the same thing. They all mean what we express with the English sentence \u201cThe dog is brown\u201d.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
