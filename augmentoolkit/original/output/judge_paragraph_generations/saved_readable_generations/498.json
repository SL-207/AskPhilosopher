{"paragraph": " Yet another response involves distinguishing between seemings and sensations (Tucker 2010). Roughly, on this response, seemings are ex- periences that present a particular content as true, and sensations are more like mental pictures. A way to get a handle on this distinction, at least according to proponents of this response, is by thinking about the psychological phenomenon of associative agnosia. People suffer- ing from associative agnosia cannot recognize familiar objects by sight, though they seem to remember them (i.e. they know what pencils are in general, for example, but can\u2019t recognize one when they see it). What\u2019s more, although such individuals cannot recognize a pencil, for instance, when they are looking at one, they can accurately draw the pencil that they see. Reflecting on this phenomenon leads some to insist that what is going on is that the person has visual sensations of the pencil (they see what it looks like), but they lack the normally associated seeming (it doesn\u2019t seem to them that the object is a pencil). This response contends that it is seemings\u2014not sensations\u2014that pro- vide justification. Applied to the speckled hens, this response claims that when it comes to the first hen, Gilbert has both sensations of its three speckles and the seeming that the hen is three-speckled; so he is justified in believing that the hen has three speckles. When it comes to the 48-speckled hen, Gilbert has the sensations of it, but he lacks the seeming that the hen is 48-speckled. And so Gilbert isn\u2019t justified in believing that the hen has 48 speckles. A final sort of response claims that Gilbert experiences each speckle of the 48-speckled hen without experiencing the hen as 48-speckled (Chudnoff and DiDomenico 2015). The thought here is that Gilbert\u2019s experience represents that speckle1, that speckle2, that speckle3, and so on, but it doesn\u2019t represent that there are 48 speckles.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
