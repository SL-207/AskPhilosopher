{"paragraph": " Indeed, if anything at all is evident it ought to be evident that if most instances of a given kind are good, then those instances of the kind that are better than most instances of the kind must also be good. Such instances may be referred to as the better or the best instances of their kind. They are the better or the best instances of their kind because they have certain excellences that most instances of the kind do not have. They exhibit not only the good-making properties that most instances of their kind manifest but also have what may be referred to as certain excellent-making properties that most good instances of their kind do not have. 3. Goodness and Excellence Such excellent-making properties are divisible into two types. The first type consists simply of the good-making properties possessed by most of the good instances of a given kind, possessed to a greater or higher degree by the excellent instances of the kind. An excellent instance of a kind, to be such an instance, need not have any good-making properties that most instances of the kind do not have, but instead might only have the good-making properties of its kind to a higher degree than do most of the good instances of the kind. The second type of excellent-making 98 The Nature of Value property consists of properties distinct from any of the good-making properties of good instances of a kind, by virtue of the possession of which the excellent instances of a kind are excellent and not merely good instances. An excellent-making property of the first type is simply a good-making property, possessed in a higher degree by excellent instances of the kind than by those instances that are merely good instances. An excellent-making property of the second type is a prop\u00ad erty possessed only by excellent instances of a kind, not by instances that are merely good instances, by virtue of the possession of which an excellent instance of a kind is such an instance and not merely a good instance.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
