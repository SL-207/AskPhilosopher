{"paragraph": " Since the states of affairs consisting of John's being honest, John's being blind, and John's having brown eyes all obtain, and since the obtaining of the first state of affairs is good, that of the second bad, and that of the third indifferent, there must be some difference between them by virtue of which the obtaining of the first is good, that of the second bad, and that of the third neither good nor bad. Similar consid\u00ad erations apply to the non-obtaining of John's being dishonest, John's being sighted, and John's having blue eyes. Since their obtaining is something the first three states of affairs have in common, and since the obtaining of the first is good, that of the second bad, and that of the third indifferent, their obtaining cannot be the ground of the goodness of the obtaining of the first, of the badness of the obtaining of the second, or of the indifference of the obtaining of the third. Similar considerations apply to the non-obtaining of the second three states of affairs. But if their obtaining cannot be the ground of the goodness, badness, or indifference of the obtaining of the first three states of affairs, and if their not obtaining cannot be the source of that of the non-obtaining of the second three states of affairs, Ontological Categories and Bearers of Value 2 l then it wouid seem that the value of the obtaining or the non-obtaining of these states of affairs must be determined by their nature regardless of whether they do or do not obtain. It was argued above ( 1) that states of affairs that obtain are facts and (2) that the obtaining of states of affairs that obtain and the non\u00ad obtaining of those that do not obtain are also facts. If this is correct, and if the considerations just presented are acceptable, then facts in these two senses of \"fact\" are either good, bad, or indifferent. John's being honest, John's being blind, and John's having brown eyes, since each is a state of affairs that obtains, is a fact.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
