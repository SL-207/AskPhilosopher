{"paragraph": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND Imaginative cases, or what might be called puzzles and other thought experiments, play a central role in philosophy of mind. The real world also furnishes philosophers with an ample supply of such puzzles. This volume collects 50 of the most important historical and con- temporary cases in philosophy of mind and describes their signifi- cance. The authors divide them into five sections: consciousness and dualism; physicalist theories and the metaphysics of mind; content, intentionality, and representation; perception, imagination, and atten- tion; and persons, personal identity, and the self. Each chapter provides background, describes a central case or cases, discusses the relevant literature, and suggests further readings. Philosophy of Mind: 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments promises to be a useful teaching tool as well as a handy resource for anyone interested in the area. Key Features: \u2022\t Offers stand-alone chapters, each presented in an identical format: \u2022\t Background \u2022\t The Case \u2022\t Discussion \u2022\t Recommended Reading \u2022\t Each chapter is self-contained, allowing students to quickly under- stand an issue and giving instructors flexibility in assigning readings to match the themes of the course. \u2022\t Additional pedagogical features include a general volume intro- duction as well as smaller introductions to each of the five sections and a glossary at the end of the book.
