{"paragraph": " That difference between the yogis\u2019 concepts and our phenome- nal concepts is significant. Suppose the yogis are supplied with the Yogis 47 complete physical truth about their world. That includes the infor- mation that flurgs are brain states. Perhaps they could wonder if that information pertains specifically to their flurgs. But they need not wonder about that for very long; suppose they are also supplied with information enabling them to locate themselves in their world. They would then be positioned to know that their flurgs are brain states, and therefore to exclude the possibility that flurgs are non-physical. By contrast, supplying a person with the complete physical truth plus information about their place in the actual world would not position them to know whether pains are brain states. The nature of pains and other states of consciousness would remain open (see Chapter 4). If so, then the analogy between the yogi case and the zombie case is less compelling than Balog suggests.
