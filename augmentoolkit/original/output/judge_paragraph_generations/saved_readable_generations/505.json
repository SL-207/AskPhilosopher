{"paragraph": " EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: COGNITIVE PENETRATION Patricia and Peter have decided to try their hands at panning for gold in a particular stream together. Patricia is an expert at panning for gold. She has trained for many years to be able to identify gold even in very small quantities by sight, she knows proper panning techniques, and so on. Peter, on the other hand, is completely new to all of this. He has never learned to distinguish gold from other things, such as fool\u2019s gold, by sight, he doesn\u2019t know proper panning techniques, etc. However, Peter is extremely keen to find some gold on his first out- ing. After getting everything set up, Patricia and Peter start scooping COGNITIVE PENETRATION 159 up soil from the streambed and sifting through it. This goes on for quite some time. At this point Peter is getting a bit anxious\u2014he wor- ries that he won\u2019t find any gold. Nevertheless, he really wants to do so. Finally, as they are sifting through the hundredth panful, Patricia and Peter both see something that catches their eyes. As a result of her training, a pebble in their pan seems to Patricia to be gold. That same pebble also seems to be gold to Peter, but not because of training\u2014 after all he\u2019s had none\u2014instead, it seems that way to Peter because he really wants to find gold. What are we to think about Patricia\u2019s and Peter\u2019s seemings in this case? It seems intuitive that Patricia\u2019s seeming that the pebble is gold gives her justification for believing that the pebble is gold. But what about Peter\u2019s? Some claim that since his seeming is the result of his wishful thinking, it doesn\u2019t give him justification for believing that the pebble is gold. Why does this matter? Recall that phenomenal conservatism says that if it clearly and firmly seems to S that p, then (assuming that S doesn\u2019t have undefeated defeaters) S is justified in believing that p. In this case, it clearly and firmly seems to Patricia that the pebble is gold, and it clearly and firmly seems to Peter that the pebble is gold.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
