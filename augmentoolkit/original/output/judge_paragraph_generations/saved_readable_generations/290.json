{"paragraph": " THE CASE Consider a group of 26 subjects. Each of them is asked to think of a different letter of the alphabet\u2014the first thinks of \u201cA,\u201d the second thinks of \u201cB,\u201d and so on. No matter how closely related the subjects are, no matter how close they stand together or how much they talk to one another, there is no 27th subject composed of them all\u2014no further subject that holds the entire alphabet in mind. Minds do not compose other minds in this way. My mind is my mind, your mind is yours, and no matter how much we put our heads together, these two minds do not compose a third mind; nor can their contents in any way merge. DISCUSSION The independence of minds and the privacy of their contents might seem to be challenged by the thought experiments of science fiction such as the \u201cmind meld\u201d from Star Trek. The alien species the Vulcans can perform mind melds by way of a special form of contact with another individual: If the Vulcan puts their hand on another creature\u2019s face in a certain position, they can somehow become directly aware of that other creature\u2019s thoughts and conscious states\u2014that is, they can know the contents of the other creature\u2019s mind the same way they know the contents of their own minds. Unraveling the issues here requires a closer look at the metaphysics of thoughts. In particular, the privacy of thoughts is not like the pri- vacy of a hand in poker. Even when the cards in your hand are known only to you, those cards\u2014those very same token pieces of paper\u2014 could easily have been in your opponent\u2019s hand; and, before they were dealt, they existed without being in anyone\u2019s hand at all. Mental states aren\u2019t this way. They can\u2019t exist mind-independently. Pains don\u2019t just float around unfelt until they bother somebody. One tempting path is to think of them as modifications of the self, rather than independent objects a particular subject happens to Sharing Feelings, Combining Minds 281 glimpse.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
