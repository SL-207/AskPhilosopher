{"paragraph": " What exactly is direct acquaint- ance? It\u2019s very difficult to spell it out precisely, so classical foundationalists tend to explain it by way of examples. Consider a situation where you are in severe pain. The relationship that you bear to your sensation of pain is one of direct acquaintance. As might be guessed from the stringent nature of these requirements, classical foundationalists hold that you can\u2019t have non-\u00ad inferentially justified beliefs about the world around you. You can only have non-inferentially justified beliefs about the contents of your own mind (and perhaps some truths of logic). Classical foundationalism is one of the most extreme forms of internalism. By contrast, moderate foundationalism, which SPECKLED HEN PROBLEM 149 comes in both internalist and externalist varieties, is much less stringent when it comes to the requirements for non-inferential justification. Many forms of moderate foundationalism allow, for instance, that if one has an experience as of p, then one has non-inferential justification for believing p. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: EPISTEMIC JUSTIFICATION: EXTERNALISM VS. INTERNALISM; SPECKLED HEN PROBLEM Gilbert has decided that he would like to have a chicken for a pet. So, Gilbert is looking at some hens in a pen. He sees two hens in good lighting and from a pretty close distance. Both hens have white feathers with black speckles. One of them has just a few speckles, but the other has many. But oddly enough, in both cases all of the hen\u2019s speckles are on one side of its body. So when Gilbert looks, he sees all of the speckles on each hen. The first hen has exactly three speckles and the second has exactly 48 speckles. Gilbert, however, hasn\u2019t taken the time to count the speckles on either of the hens. This case sounds rather mundane and uninteresting. And yet, it poses a widely discussed challenge for classical foundationalism. Ad- ditionally, the challenge has been argued to apply to moderate forms of foundationalism as well.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
