Numerical identity\u2003 Being the same individual thing. Numerical identity contrasts with similarity, even exact similarity. Two iden- tical twins are numerically distinct, no matter how similar they might be. Panpsychism\u2003 The theory that mentality is everywhere. On some versions of this theory, at least some of the fundamental features of the concrete world (e.g., quarks) are or have phenomenal properties. Phenomenal concept\u2003 A concept of conscious experience in the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d sense. For example, those who have seen colors usually have a concept of what it\u2019s like to have that sort of \u00adexperience, and those who have not usually lack (or at least do not well understand) that concept. See also phenomenal \u00adconsciousness, phenomenal property/qualia. Phenomenal consciousness\u2003 Consciousness in the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d sense. For example, there is something it\u2019s like to feel pain or see red. For a person to be phenomenally conscious is for there to something it is like to be that person. For a mental state to be phenomenally conscious is for there to be something it is like to have that mental state. Phenomenal property/qualia\u2003 Property of conscious experience in the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d sense. For example, the distinctive way it feels to experience pain. See also phenomenal consciousness. Physical necessity\u2003 A proposition is physically necessary if it is nec- essary relative to physical phenomena such as physical laws. For example, arguably it is physically necessary that there is no stable cubic mile of uranium-235; the laws of physics entail that such a thing would be unstable. See also necessity, metaphysical necessity. Physical theory of personal identity\u2003 The theory of personal identity that holds that a person\u2019s identity over time consists in various physical facts, such as facts about the brain and/or body.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
