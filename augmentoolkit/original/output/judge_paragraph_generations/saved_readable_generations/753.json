{"paragraph": " Yet such otherworldly wanting and hoping, if it may be so termed, like faith without works, may be said to be dead if it is unaccompanied by authentically wanting and hoping that God become incarnate in man and, through man, in the world. I can also authentically want and hope the latter without believing that God exists independently of man and the world and also without wanting or hoping that He do so. Such authentic wanting and hoping manifest themselves most fully in per- The Primacy of Practical Rationality 1 19 forming various of the acts or works of love that living faith issues in, and because of this they have not only great intrinsic value but also great instrumental and contributory value. Insufficient attention has been paid by philosophers to the third person of the Christian Trinity-to God the Holy Spirit or the Holy Spirit of God, as this Spirit becomes incarnate in each of us in the degree to which each of us endeavors to live his life as that than which no greater can be conceived would live His life were He incarnate in human form. None of us, because of various of the frailties and limita\u00ad tions of our common human nature, can ever succeed fully in living our lives as God Himself would live His were He incarnate in human form. Nonetheless, the Holy Spirit of God may literally be said to be incarnate in and to be animating each of us in the degree to which we do endeavor so to live our lives. In doing so, we may be said authentically to want the Divine Holy Spirit to be real and present and alive and active in us and, through us, in the world, regardless of whether God also exists independently of us and the world. As was indicated above, an endeavor so to live our lives has, greater intrinsic, instrumental, and con\u00ad tributory value than believing that God exists independently of man and the world and even than wanting and hoping that He so exist. This, however, does not mean that such an endeavor has greater intrinsic value than that which is believed, wanted, and hoped for in believing, wanting, and hoping that that than which no greater can be conceived does indeed exist independently of man and the world.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
