{"paragraph": " The promotion of the interests of others, however, can never for the egoist be morally required as an end Morality and Rationality 1 63 but instead can be required only as a\u00b7 means to the promotion of one's own interests. There are two kinds of reasons the- egoist might supply in support of his position, one of which may be labeled, perhaps somewhat mislead\u00ad ingly, \"deontological,\" and the other, again perhaps somewhat mis\u00ad leadingly, \"teleological\". According to the deontological reason, acting in the way the egoist recommends is simply right in itself, regardless of whether such action does in fact succeed in promoting one's own long\u00ad term interests and regardless also of the effect on others. To say, how\u00ad ever, that acting in the way the egoist recommends is simply right in itself, independently of its consequences, would seem to amount only to saying that the rightness of such action is evident in itself. The rightness of such action does not, however, in fact seem to be evident. Indeed, there are acts of other specific sorts, such as keeping a promise or ren\u00ad dering aid, the performance of which in certain situations might not contribute to the promotion of one's own interests, yet the performance of which in such situations would be more evidently right than the omission of such acts for the sake of promoting one's own interests. If so, then it seems that the egoist cannot supply adequate support for his position by giving \"deontological\" reasons, which in any event would not be reasons in any acceptable sense of \"reason\". We turn now to the question of whether the egoist would fare any better by giving \"teleological\" reasons in support of his position. This he would do if he were to argue that each person ought to seek as an ul\u00ad timate end only the promotion of his own long-term interests because the attainment of one's long-term interests is intrinsically good.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
