{"paragraph": " Similar considerations, with of course the obvious necessary changes, would apply to those things, if there are any, that universally are\u00b7 inherently bad and to those, if again there are any, that universally are inherently indifferent. Similar considerations, with the necessary changes, apply to Lewis' account of the intrinsic value of experiences. Their value too would be completely subjective even though there might be experiences of certain kinds that are such that anyone who has such experiences likes them or that are such that anyone would like them were they to have them. Indeed, Lewis' account of inherent and intrinsic value is such that intrinsic value turns out to be even more subjective than inherent value. On his view, various objects can have positive or negative inherent value independently of whether anyone does in fact have experience of them, provided that they be such that someone would like or dislike them were he to have experience of them. It is therefore at least abstractly possible that there be a world completely devoid of subjects of experience that nonetheless contains inherently valuable objects, provided that it contain objects that would be liked or disliked by some subjects of experience were such subjects ever to exist and to have expe\u00ad rience of such objects. The inherently valuable objects of such a world would still exist even if there were in fact to be no subjects of experience to have experience of them. In such a world, however, nothing would have intrinsic value and everything would be intrinsically indifferent, given that experiences alone can be intrinsically good or bad. Although such a world could contain inherently good or bad objects, it could con\u00ad tain nothing intrinsically good or bad. For this reason intrinsic value, on Lewis' view, turns out to be even more subjective than inherent value. Given the complete subjectivity of intrinsic value on Lewis' view, his distinction, discussed earlier, between instrumental value and utility would not have as wide an application as it would have were intrinsic value objective.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
