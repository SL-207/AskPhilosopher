{"paragraph": " It is compatible further with the view than an understanding of oneself, of others, and of the world is a great intrinsic good. But it also recognizes that this is not the only intrinsic good and that there are situations in which its sacrifice in some degree is justified for the sake of an even greater intrinsic good such as the pre\u00ad vention of the shattering of a person's life, whether one's own or that of another. It recognizes, that is, that the prevention of the shattering of a person's life can be, and sometimes is, a far greater intrinsic good than some increase in his understanding of himself, of others, or of the world would be. It also recognizes that the duty to develop in oneself, and to assist others to develop in themselves, the kind of character mentioned above is not the only duty and that the duty of compassion and concern for one's own happiness at times requires of us that we suspend for a time the attempt to develop such a character in ourselves in order that we practice those deceptions, 'whether of others or of ourselves, re\u00ad quired by compassion for others and concern for oneself. It recognizes further that the possession of the kind of character in question is not the only virtue and that there are other virtues, especially the virtue of compassion, the practice of which in certain situations takes prece\u00ad dence over attempting in such situations to develop the kind of char\u00ad acter in question. 6. The Possibility of Self-Deception To some it might seem that in concrete existential situations the ques\u00ad tion of the justifiability of self-deception can never arise, since instances of self-deception can never occur. Although we can deceive and attempt to deceive others, on such a view we can never deceive ourselves and perhaps never even endeavor to do so. One reason that might be pre\u00ad sented in support of such a view is connected with what may be referred to as the alleged intentionality and self-consciousness of deception.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
