{"paragraph": "\" and the sentence \"It is rational to act morally\" lose much, if not indeed all, the significance they appear to Morality and Rationality 151 have for practice. Ordinarily when we ask such a question or make such a statement we do not intend to be asking whether it is rational to act rationally or to be saying that it is rational to act rationally. Instead, by asking such a question or by making such a statement we intend to raise a question or to make a statement that has some significance for prac\u00ad tice. Such a question and such a statement can have such significance only if \"acting morally\" does not have the same meaning as \"acting rationally\". It might be true that one cannot act morally without acting rationally and that one cannot act rationally without acting morally. But if it is, one cannot show that it is simply by using \"acting morally\" in such a way that it has precisely the same meaning as \"acting ratio\u00ad nally\". Instead, what one must show is that it is rational to act morally even though the concept of acting rationally is a different concept from the concept of acting morally. The question of whether it is rational to act morally and the claim that it is rational to do so can have signifi\u00ad cance for practice only if the concepts in question are distinct and not identical concepts. There are two ways in which one might attempt to show that the con\u00ad cepts in question are distinct. One way is to develop an egoistic concept of rationality and a non-egoistic concept of morality. The other is to develop an egoistic concept of morality and a non-egoistic concept of rationality. Few, if indeed any, philosophers who have dealt with the problem have taken the second alternative. Perhaps the major reason this is so is that the conjunction of concepts it would require would be somewhat strange. The view it would involve is that although each person acts rightly if and only if he acts compatibly with the promotion of his interests, a person can act in this way without thereby acting rationally.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
