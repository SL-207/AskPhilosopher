{"paragraph": " Attempts to define these two concepts fall into either of two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive classes. One class consists of attempts to define them in terms of non-evaluative concepts, whether psychological or non\u00ad psychological, the other of attempts to define them in terms of evalua\u00ad tive concepts. I examine various attempts of both types, argue that they all fail, and conclude that the concepts in question are indefinable. I argue also that although the intrinsic goodness or badness of a given thing can sometimes be established by appealing to the intrinsic good\u00ad ness or badness of something else, ultimately such proof rests on seeing without proof that something is intrinsically good or bad. All proof, however, whether in value theory or in any other area of inquiry, rests on seeing without proof that some given proposition is true and that certain propositions follow from certain others. I argue in chapter 5 that although the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness are the central concepts of value theory it does not follow that they are also the central concepts of moral philosophy. Instead, the central concepts of moral philosophy-such as the concepts of duty or obligation, ought, rightness and wrongness, supererogation, rights, moral goodness and badness, and moral virtues and vices--can be explicated without using the concepts of intrinsic goodness and bad\u00ad ness, so that moral philosophy, rather than being simply a branch of value theory, is instead presupposed in certain respects by the latter. At the same time, however, what may be referred to as \"moral objectives\" are such that any moral objective has either intrinsic or extrinsic posi\u00ad tive or negative value and therefore either positive or negative total value. The chapter ends with a brief treatment of theodicy. In the sixth chapter an account is presented of the ground of the value of particulars, which are either persons or things that are not persons.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
