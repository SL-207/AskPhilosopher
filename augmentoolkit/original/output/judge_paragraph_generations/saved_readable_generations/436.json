{"paragraph": " \u00adAnother way of developing this sort of response is to argue that some beliefs are what might be called \u201cepistemically self-promoting\u201d (Moon 2021). The idea here is that some beliefs can themselves provide good rea- son to think that one\u2019s having those beliefs is the result of a reliable CONTINGENCY OF BELIEF 89 process. This sort of response has recently been offered in support of particular religious beliefs.
