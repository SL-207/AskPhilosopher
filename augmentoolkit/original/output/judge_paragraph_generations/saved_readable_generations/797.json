{"paragraph": " If, that is, one places greater value on acting rationally than on acting morally, one might well assume that the latter but not the former requires justifica\u00ad tion. Indeed, one might well assume that being rational neither needs to be nor can be justified rationally, on the ground that any attempt at such justification would suffer from a self-defeating circularity, given that any proposed justification must itself be rational if it is to be rationally acceptable. And if one does place greater value on acting rationally than on acting morally, one might also believe that the latter not only requires a rational justification in terms of the former but also that it can be given such a justification in a non-circular way, since there is nothing circular about justifying acting morally by showing that it is rational so to act. Such a view, however, although it has been the prevailing view among philosophers who have discussed the relationship to one another of morality and rationality, is by no means the only possible view. Although such an answer has rarely been given by philosophers to the question \"Is it rational to be moral?,\" one might well answer it by responding as follows. \"No, it is not, but we nonetheless still ought to be moral and to act morally. Although acting rationally might be important, it is more important to act morally, and if one cannot be both fully rational and fully moral it is more important to be moral than to be rational. Moreover, if either of the two, acting morally and acting rationally, requires justification in terms of the other, it is the latter that Morality and Rationality 153 requires justification in terms of the-former, since it is more important that we act morally than it is that we act rationally. Instead, then, of asking and attempting to answer the question 'Is it rational to be moral?' which implies, or at least suggests, that it is more important that we be rational than that we be moral and that we can be justified in acting morally only if it can be shown that it is rational so to act, we ought instead to raise the question of whether it is moral to be rational.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
