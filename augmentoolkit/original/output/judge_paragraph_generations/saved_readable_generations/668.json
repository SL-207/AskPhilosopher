{"paragraph": " Moreover, the world itself, since it is not a part of some larger whole and is not a means to the existence of anything outside itself, can have no contributory value and no instrumental value. Instead, the only kind of value it can have is intrinsic value. It might, however, be thought that since we cannot know all its parts, nor even always know the value, positive or negative, of various of its parts of which we do have knowl\u00ad edge, we cannot know whether it itself on the whole is intrinsically good, intrinsically bad, or neither good nor bad. If, however, the whole that contains as parts everything that exists, occurs, or obtains but yet is not itself a part of any other whole contains God, conceived in the Anselmian way as that than which no greater can be conceived, then necessarily it is intrinsically good. Lest heresy be sus\u00ad pected here, let it be noted that to say that the whole than which no more inclusive can be conceived contains God as one of its parts is com\u00ad patible with the view that every other part of this whole is created by God and depends completely upon the continuing conserving action of God for its continuing existence from moment to moment. Although God, conceived in this way, would not be a part of the whole He creates and sustains in being, this whole being the created world, He would be a part of the whole containing as parts both Himself and the world He creates, and this whole, given that God is that than which no greater can be conceived, necessarily would be intrinsically good. The reason this is the case is that the positive value of the existence of God, again conceived as that than which no greater can be conceived, would be so unsurpassably great that necessarily it would be unsurpassably greater than any negative value the existence of the created world might have, regardless of the degree to which the existence of the created world might be intrinsically bad.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
