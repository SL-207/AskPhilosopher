{"paragraph": " RESPONSES Immediately after these cases were first put forward, there were phi- losophers who agreed with Woozley and Radford that one can know that p without believing that p. But, there were also others who sim- ply denied that these cases are genuine counterexamples. Yet others argued that these sorts of cases simply aren\u2019t clear enough to be used KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT BELIEF 35 to determine whether the traditional account of knowledge has a problem or not. More recently, some have sought to use experimental methods to settle the dispute about cases of this kind. It has been argued that the data suggest that ordinary people (i.e. nonphilosophers) tend to agree that knowledge doesn\u2019t require belief and that this shows that this sort of case is successful as a counterexample to the traditional account of knowledge (Myers-Schulz and Schwitzgebel 2013). However, others have argued that what the empirical data show is that there are really two different kinds of belief\u2014thin and thick (Buckwalter et al. 2015). Thin belief that p doesn\u2019t require explicitly assenting to the truth of the p; instead, one just has to represent or store p in one\u2019s mind as information. Thick belief requires more than this bare minimum of storing as information. Those who claim that there is this distinction between thick and thin belief argue that thin belief is all that is required for knowledge, and they maintain that in the sort of case that we saw above thin belief is present. And so, they maintain that these cases fail to show that knowledge doesn\u2019t require belief. A related response makes use of a much more widely accepted philosophical distinction\u2014the distinction between occurrent (con- sciously before one\u2019s mind) and dispositional (stored in some sense) beliefs (Rose and Schaffer 2013). On this way of approaching the issue, it is true that Geoff doesn\u2019t occurrently believe the various an- swers to the quiz questions.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
