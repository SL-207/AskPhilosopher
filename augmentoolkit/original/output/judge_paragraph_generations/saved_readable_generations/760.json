{"paragraph": " In at least some such cases of conflict, practical rationality requires of others who know such truths that they not reveal them to those who cannot bear to know them, and it might also require of those who cannot bear to know them that they not undertake an inquiry conducted in accordance with the canons of theoretical reason in an effort to discover such truths. In such cases it is better that those who cannot bear the consequences refrain from eating of the fruit of the tree of theoretical knowledge. In such cases the requirements of practical reason overrule the claims of theoretical reason, and practical rationality consists in hiding from truths we cannot bear to know and in shielding others from truths we know, or believe we know, they cannot bear to know. It is only narrow-minded and zealous partisans of the primacy of the\u00ad oretical over practical reason who would reject such a position and proclaim \"Let true belief, knowledge, and understanding be sought and revealed when attained even though the heavens fall.\" In practice, how\u00ad ever, even the most zealous partisans of theoretical reason do not always comply with such a dictum. In a situation of the following sort, for example, it is doubtful that many such zealots would comply with such a dictum or advise others to do so. Suppose that a certain man is married and has six children. In all other respects he leaves nothing to be desired as a husband and father, but he is also a philanderer and has one affair after another with a series of various women and succeeds in concealing these affairs from his wife and children. There are others, however, who know of these affairs. Suppose also that if his wife and children learned of them disastrous consequences would ensue. His wife and children would be heartbroken, the marriage and the family would be destroyed, and the happy life of the family would be gone for\u00ad ever.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
