{"paragraph": " However, all of that is about to change because she is about to be released from her black and white room. Mary leaves her room and for the first time she lays her eyes on a bright, ripe, red apple. Now she knows what it\u2019s like to see red! But, if she only now knows what it\u2019s like to see red, that means that she didn\u2019t know this before seeing the apple. However, if Mary didn\u2019t know what it is like to see red, that means that although she knew all of the physical facts about seeing red, she didn\u2019t know all there is to know about seeing red. Hence, it seems that there are facts beyond the physical facts. If this assessment of Mary and her new experience with seeing red is true, then physicalism seems to be in trouble because there appear to be things in the universe that are not physical\u2014such as the sort of thing that Mary experiences for the first time when she sees red. RESPONSES Some physicalists respond to this example by questioning whether the thought experiment involving Mary is really even possible. KNOWLEDGE ARGUMENT AGAINST PHYSICALISM 111 For\u00a0example, some point out that it isn\u2019t clear that one can actually learn all of the physical facts in the way that Mary would have to in the black and white room. It is more common, however, for physicalists to accept that the scenario depicted above is possible, but argue that it fails to pose a genuine problem for physicalism. A popular response of this sort involves arguing that Mary doesn\u2019t actually learn new facts when she sees the red apple for the first time. There are two primary ways of developing this sort of response. One says that rather than propositional knowledge (i.e. knowledge of facts), Mary gains knowledge-how. She develops new abilities, such as the ability to determine whether something is red by looking at it (Lewis 1988, Nemirow 2007). The other primary way of developing this re- sponse insists that Mary neither gains propositional knowledge nor \u00adknowledge-how, but instead Mary gains acquaintance knowledge when she sees the red apple (Conee 1994).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
