In the puzzle that we will discuss in this chapter, Bernard Williams tries to show that our intuitions about body-swap cases are much more ambiguous than is usually thought. THE CASE Williams raises his puzzle by asking us to compare two different cases. Case 1. Imagine that scientists invent a machine designed to be used during brain surgery. The machine extracts all of the mental content from a person\u2019s brain, places it into a storage device for the duration of the surgery, and then restores it to the brain once the surgery is com- plete. The scientists then discover that the mental content extracted need not be restored to the original brain from which it was taken; they can transfer the mental content from X\u2019s brain into Y\u2019s brain, and likewise they can transfer the mental content from Y\u2019s brain into X\u2019s brain. Call this the ET process (for extraction/transfer). Now imagine that we run a contest where two lucky finalists will have a 50% shot at a $1,000,000 prize. (When Williams proposed the thought experiment in 1970, the amount was $100,000, but we\u2019re adjusting it for inflation!) The downside is that the finalists will also have a 50% shot at being subjected to painful torture. Among the folks who sign up for the contest, we select two, A and B, as the fi- nalists. We explain the ET process to A and B, and then we ask them to vote for who should get the reward afterwards. Should it be the A-body-person (whose brain now contains all of the mental content from B\u2019s brain and none of the mental content from A\u2019s brain) or the B-body-person (whose brain now has all the mental content from A\u2019s brain and none of the mental content from B\u2019s brain)?", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
