{"paragraph": " To the degree that I pretend to myself or others to have them when in fact I do not I am inauthentic. I can be fully authentic only if I do not attempt to deceive either myself or others into believing that I have virtues that in fact I do not have or that I do not have vices that in fact I do have. Such authenticity is itself one of the virtues, such inau\u00ad thenticity one of the vices. The degree to \u00b7which deception, either of myself or others, is likely to succeed is a function of the degree to which I and others know myself. The better others know me, the less likely it is that attempts to deceive them will succeed. Others, such as my friends and relatives, who have knowledge of how I have acted in various situations in which various of the virtues can be outwardly manifested are less likely than those who do not have such knowledge to believe that I have virtues I pretend to have but in fact do not have. If so, then it might seem that it is even less likely that attempts at self-deception will succeed. This is the case, it might seem, for two reasons. The first is that each person is in a better position than others can ever be to know how he has acted in all the various situations in which he is involved. Unlike others, he is invari\u00ad ably present in all the situations that provide him an opportunity to act. The second reason is that each person, as was mentioned above, has a direct epistemological access that no one else can have to various inward manifestations of his virtues and vices. Others can come to know my virtues and vices only through coming to know how I have acted in situations of various sorts. I, however, can know not only how I have acted in situations of various sorts but also what my inward 108 The Nature of Value thoughts, feelings, and desires are regardless of whether they are out\u00ad wardly manifested.
