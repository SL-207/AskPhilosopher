{"paragraph": " Through our endeavoring to live such lives, the Divine Holy Spirit of God becomes real and present and alive and active in us and, through us, in the world. To the degree to which we live such lives the Divine Holy Spirit becomes human as real, present, alive, and active in us, and our spirit becomes holy and divine. Because of this we may say literally that God becomes incarnate, real, present, alive and active in us and, through us, in the world, regardless of whether He also exists independently of us and the world. It is one thing to believe that God exists independently of man and the world, another thing to want and hope that He does, and still another thing authentically to want and hope that He exist incarnate in man and in the human spirit and, through such incarnation, in the world. Each of these three things is distinct from and independent of the other two, and none of the three is reducible to either of the others, whether taken singly or in combination. I can believe that God exists independently of man and the world without wanting or hoping that He does and also without authentically wanting or hoping that He exist incarnate in man and, through man, in the world. Such belief has little or no intrinsic value and, like faith without works, may be said to be dead, regardless of whether it be arrived at through an act of faith or will or through seeing that the existence of God follows demonstra\u00ad tively from certain premises I see to be true and accordingly accept. I can also want and hope that God exist independently of man and the world without believing that He does and also without authentically wanting or hoping that He exist incarnate in man and, through man, in the world. Unlike believing that He exists independently of man and the world, such wanting and hoping does have some intrinsic value, espe\u00ad cially if it arises from recognizing ( 1) that we ought to want and hope that whatever has an intrinsic goodness than which no greater can be conceived exists and (2) that it is God alone that can have such good\u00ad ness.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
