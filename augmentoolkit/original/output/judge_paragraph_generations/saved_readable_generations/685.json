{"paragraph": " Since all pos\u00ad sible evaluative definitions suffer from this defect, it will suffice for our purposes here if I indicate a few that have at least some initial plausi\u00ad bility. It will also suffice, and be helpful for purposes of expository sim\u00ad plicity, if I list only definitions of the concept of intrinsic goodness. It should be an easy matter for the reader to frame corresponding defini\u00ad tions of the concept of intrinsic badness. The concept of intrinsic goodness has been or could be defined in any of the following at least initially plausible ways. To say that x is intrin\u00ad sically good is to say that ( 1) the existence or occurrence of x is in itself preferable to its non-existence or non-occurrence; (2) the existence or occurrence of x is or would be better in itself that its non-existence or non-occurrence; (3) x, taken in abstraction from its relations to every\u00ad thing else, ought to exist or occur; (4) xis worth having in itself; or (5) it Definition, Proof, and Knowledge of Intrinsic Value 65 is correct, fitting, or right to like or value in itself x and/or its existence or occurrence. The reader will doubtless be able to think of still other at least initially plausible definitions. The list given, however, will suffice for our purposes. Each definition on the list is compatible with each of the others, so that one could consistently accept them all as alternative definitions or perhaps as together constituting a conjunctive definition. Most of these definitions suffer from flaws unique to themselves. A defect from which (2) suffers is that it seems to be circular, since to say that the existence or occurrence of x is or would be better in itself than its non-existence or non-occurrence seems to be to say only that its exis\u00ad tence or occurrence is or would be more good in itself than its non\u00ad existence or non-occurrence. If so, then the concept of good is more primitive or fundamental than the concept of better than and therefore cannot be defined adequately in terms of the latter.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
