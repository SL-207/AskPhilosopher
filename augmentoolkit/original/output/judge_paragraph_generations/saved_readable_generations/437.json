(ANTI-LUMINOSITY) Background: It was a common assumption throughout much of the history of philosophy that we have special access to the contents of our own minds. This assumption is quite common in nonphilosophical contexts as well. We naturally tend to think that we have special access to our own thoughts and sensations. This access seems special in at least two ways. The first is simply that we have access to our mental states that no one else has. For instance, no one else can literally feel your pain; only you can feel your pain. The second way our access to the contents of our mental seems special is that it is apparently luminous. The luminosity of our mental states means that when we are in a particular mental state we are always in a position to know that we are in that mental state. For example, when you are in pain, you are in a position to know that you are in pain; when you feel cold, you are in a position to know that you feel cold; and so on. There are various reasons why the luminosity of our mental states in particular has been thought to be very important. One of the most prominent reasons, at least since the time of Descartes, is that this feature of our cognitive lives is thought to give us a starting point in responding to skepticism. Perhaps we can be tricked concerning the world around us, as the skeptic alleges, but, the thought goes, at least we can\u2019t be tricked about the contents of our own minds. Since our mental states are luminous, we can use our knowledge of them as a founda- tion from which we can build our response to the skeptic.
