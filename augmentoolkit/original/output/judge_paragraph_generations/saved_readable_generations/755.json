{"paragraph": " And if God can be considered as part of a whole containing as parts Him and the created world, His existence also has greater contributory value than that of any other conceivable thing, since no other conceivable thing could contribute as much good\u00ad ness to any whole of which it is a part as the existence of God would to the whole containing Him and the created world as parts. It was said above that the belief that God exists independently of man and the world has little or no intrinsic value. At least its intrinsic value is less than that of wanting and hoping that He does so exist and that of endeavoring to live our lives as He would live His life were He incarnate in human form. Such belief, however, can, and frequently does, have great instrumental value. For countless numbers of people it has pro\u00ad vided what they believe to be the central meaning of their lives, and for countless others it has moved them to endeavor to live their lives as they believe God would live His were He incarnate in human form. Such belief is sometimes so central to a person's life that were it lost his life would be irremediably broken into pieces. And although morality might be independent of such belief in the sense that some people who do not have such belief nonetheless live exemplary moral lives, for others morality is so tied to such belief that were the latter to be destroyed the central motive moving them to endeavor to lead morally good lives would also be destroyed. The fact that such belief is frequently instrumentally good in the ways The Primacy of Practical Rationality 121 indicated does not mean that it is true. The possession of true belief and knowledge, however, if it be intrinsically good at all, is only one kind of intrinsic good among others, some of which in certain situations might have considerably greater intrinsic value. Philosophers, perhaps because of their theoretical interests, sometimes speak as though they believe true belief and knowledge to be the greatest of intrinsic goods, for the sake of which all other goods ought to be sacrificed in cases of conflict.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
