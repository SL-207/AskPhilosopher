{"paragraph": " Good Samaritan that you are, you follow the trail so you can let the hapless shopper know that they have a leaky bag. You wind up going in circles through the aisles, never catching up to the shopper, until you notice that at each pass the trail is thickening. You have the realization \u201cI am the leaky shopper!\u201d (Perry 1979). At the moment you come to realize that you are the one leaking the sugar, you gain an important belief with some interesting prop- erties. We can call it an I-belief. When you gain this I-belief you gain a belief about yourself, but it\u2019s not easy to explain the exact nature of the belief. You already had a belief about yourself\u2014since you believed that the shopper with the leaky bag was spilling sugar, and you were the shopper with the leaky bag, you believed that you were spilling sugar. But that belief doesn\u2019t generate the important realization you get when you realize \u201cI am the shopper with the leaky bag.\u201d It doesn\u2019t lead you to act in the way the I-belief does: only when you have the I-belief do you look down and seal the bag of sugar. The puzzle is that this indexical belief doesn\u2019t appear to receive any clear explanation in non-indexical terms: the indexical component is essential and cannot be eliminated. Consider two further cases: Lingens in the Library: Rudolf Lingens is an amnesiac locked in the Stanford library. While in the library Lingens reads many books, \u00adincluding his own biography which describes his life down to the smallest detail. Nevertheless, he is missing something crucial: he doesn\u2019t know that he is Rudolf Lingens (Frege 1956). The Two Gods: Imagine that in some world there are two gods. One sits on the world\u2019s tallest mountain and the other sits on the world\u2019s coldest mountain. Each of them is omniscient with respect to the non-indexical facts about the world. They know there are two gods, that they are located on these different mountains, and all other non-indexical facts about the world.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
