{"paragraph": " Ted Poston is owed a special debt of gratitude for this project. He came up with the idea for this book and, when it turned out that he would not be in a position to be my coauthor, encouraged me to go solo. Finally, Molly, Kaison, and Wallace gave me the love and support needed to make any project worthwhile. Thank you all. Of course, while I have endeavored to make sure that each and every claim I make in this book is accurate and I believe each of these claims, surely some errors remain. Any errors that remain are entirely my own and not attributable to any of the wonderful people men- tioned in the previous paragraph. (If you think it is strange for me to admit that I think every claim I make in this book is true and at the same time say that there are some errors, see entry 49 on the Preface Paradox.) PART I NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE GENERAL BACKGROUND: THE TRADITIONAL ACCOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE The entries to follow begin with a bit of background information to help situate and make clear the particular puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments discussed. However, some general background on the traditional account of knowledge is helpful to have in hand for most all of the entries in this book. So, let\u2019s begin by taking a brief look at how knowledge has been understood for many years. Epistemologists have distinguished between three primary kinds of knowledge: acquaintance knowledge, knowledge-how, and proposi- tional knowledge. Although our focus for this background, and most of the book, is the last sort, it will be helpful to take a quick look at the other two as well. Acquaintance knowledge is knowledge you have of people and things you are familiar with personally. For example, let\u2019s say that you have a dog, which your new acquaintance, Fred, has never seen. You tell Fred all sorts of facts about your dog. She is a Yorkshire Terrier. She is ten (human) years old. And so on.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
