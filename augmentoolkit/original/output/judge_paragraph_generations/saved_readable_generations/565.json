{"paragraph": " Why? The halfer position is that Beauty should have this credence because she is certain that the objective chance of the coin coming up heads (or tails) is 1/2, so she should think that on any given flip, the odds of heads are 1/2. After all, the halfer position insists that Beauty doesn\u2019t have any information about the results of the flip except for the fact that it is perfectly fair, which means that the objective chance of heads is 1/2. A difficulty fac- ing this position though concerns what to say about Beauty\u2019s credence when she learns that it is Monday. It seems that before learning this there were three possibilities for her as to what has happened: it\u2019s Mon- day and heads, it\u2019s Monday and tails, or it\u2019s Tuesday and tails (remember that if the coin lands heads she\u2019ll only be awakened on Monday, so there\u2019s no Tuesday and heads possibility). When Beauty learns that to- day is Monday that information allows her to eliminate a \u00adpossibility\u2014 it\u2019s definitely not Tuesday and tails. But this seems to suggest that after she learns that it is Monday, Beauty should become more confident (i.e. assign a higher credence) that the coin lands heads. However, this doesn\u2019t seem right because she knows the coin is fair. Assigning more Sleeping Beauty 225 than 1/2 credence to heads on the flip of a fair coin seems to be a mistake. Those defending the halfer position respond by insisting that somehow the new evidence that Beauty gains when she is told that it is Monday is inadmissible when it comes to updating her credence. And so they maintain that Beauty\u2019s credence should remain unchanged. Of course, some are skeptical of the halfer move to claim that Beauty gains inadmissible evidence when she learns that it is Monday. However, a number of those who are skeptical of this move don\u2019t em- brace the thirder position. Instead, they are double halfers. The \u201cdou- ble\u201d part comes from the fact that they contend that Beauty\u2019s credence that the coin lands heads is 1/2 both before and after she learns that it is Monday.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
