{"paragraph": " And, if what was said above is true, he can also be a morally good person without having any knowledge at all of the var\u00ad ious liberal arts and sciences beyond what he needs to be good at his vocation. On the other hand, as was also maintained above, a person can have wide knowledge of such arts and sciences yet be morally cor\u00ad rupt. It is one thing to be educated, whether liberally or vocationally, another to be morally good. The possession of such education is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition of being morally good. The preceding is connected with what was said above about the dis\u00ad tinction between moral and non-moral values, which in turn is related to the distinction made earlier between having goods of various sorts and being morally good. One can have goods of various sorts without being morally good, and one can be morally good without having goods of various sorts. I earlier marked this distinction by referring simply to having goods and being good.2 The goods a person can have 202 The Nature of Value can be categorized as falling into various broad categories such as health, wealth, power, education, knowledge, and facial and bodily beauty. A person can have goods of these sorts without being good, and one can be good without having various goods of these kinds. Similarly, a person can be good at his vocation without being a good person, and a person can be a good person without being good at whatever he does to earn a living. Of special importance for our purposes here is the dis\u00ad tinction between being educated and being good. Being educated is itself a good one can have, but it is neither necessary nor sufficient for being good. The complete good of a person consists in his having various goods and in his being good. It is better that a person both have various goods and also be good than that he have goods and not be good or be good and not have various goods.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
