{"paragraph": " Thus liking good and dis\u00ad liking bad objects, insofar as they are simply the liking of good and the disliking of bad objects, are both good, even though the excessive liking of a good or disliking of a bad object are both bad, taken as excessive. They are bad because they are excessive, not because one is simply the liking of a good object, the other a disliking of a bad object. To say, however, that a good object is liked excessively or that a bad object is disliked excessively is not equivalent to saying simply that they are not liked or disliked to the precise degree to which they merit being liked or disliked. It is instead to say tha\u041a they are liked or disliked far more than they merit being liked or disliked. Even though an object be liked or dis\u00ad liked somewhat more or less than it merits being liked or disliked, such liking or disliking is not necessarily excessive. The line between ( 1) simply liking or disliking an object somewhat more or less than it merits being liked or disliked and (2) liking or disliking an object excessively, however, is a line that it is by no means always easy to draw.2 If the preceding is correct, liking good and disliking bad objects are good, disliking good and liking bad objects bad, regardless of whether the object is liked or disliked to the precise degree to which it merits being liked or disliked. Although to like a good or to dislike a bad ob\u00ad ject to the precise degree to which it merits being liked or disliked is better than liking or disliking it either more or less than it merits, the latter liking or disliking is still good. Similarly, although to like a bad ob\u00ad ject, a, more than an even worse object, b, is better than liking b more than a, and although to dislike a good object, x, more than a better ob\u00ad ject, y, is better than disliking y more than x, liking a and disliking x are still bad. In the case of good and bad objects, whether a liking or a dis\u00ad liking is good or bad is determined by whether the object liked or dis\u00ad liked is itself good or bad, not by whether it is better or worse than some other object that might be liked or disliked either more or less than it.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
