{"paragraph": " It might, however, on behalf of the view in question, be objected that it is also fortunate for me that the promotion of my own long-term wel\u00ad fare requires neither the destruction of the world nor my taking steps to bring about its destruction, since if it did, then, given that I cannot bring about its destruction or even take steps to do so, I would not be able to promote my own long-term happiness. On the view in question, the reason it is fortunate for me cannot be the reason it is also fortunate for others. This is so because on the view in question it would not be unfor\u00ad tunate for me if the promotion of my long-term interests required the destruction of the world shortly after my death if I could in fact succeed in bringing about its destruction. But it would be unfortunate for others if I, believing that the promotion of my long-term welfare required the destruction of the world, and knowing that I have the power to bring about its destruction shortly after my death, chose to do so and also succeeded in so doing. The fact, however, that it would be unfortunate for others would not give me a reason not to destroy the world, and in such an unlikely situation I would act rationally only if I did endeavor to destroy it. If, that is, I can act rationally only by acting compatibly 150 The Nature of Value with the promotion of my long-term happiness, if the promotion of the latter requires the destruction of the world, and if I have the power to destroy it, then I act rationally only if I do endeavor to destroy it. Whether such an egoistic view of practical rationality conflicts with morality depends upon what morality requires of us. There are two conflicting views of morality, one of which is compatible with such a view of practical rationality, the other of which is not, or at least seems not to be. The first view of morality is the position that a person acts rightly only if he acts compatibly with th\u0457 promotion of his own long\u00ad term good.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
