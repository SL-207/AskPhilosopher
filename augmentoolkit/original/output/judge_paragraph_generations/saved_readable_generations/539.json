{"paragraph": " New York: Oxford University Press. 39 BAD MATH (DISAGREEMENT\u2014 AGAINST EQUAL WEIGHT) Background: As we saw in the previous entry, some cases of disagreement seem to support giving equal weight to the beliefs of one\u2019s epistemic peer. There are other cases however that challenge this view. In these cases, it seems that we should think that it is our epistemic peer who is mistaken rather than ourselves when we disagree. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: DISAGREEMENT Let\u2019s reimagine the restaurant case that we discussed in the previous entry. Again, Asa and Pedro are out to dinner, but this time it\u2019s with a small group of people. And again they are going to calculate the check. However, this time they first decide they need to figure out how many people to split the check between. Asa says, \u201cwell there\u2019s me and you, that\u2019s two. And, there\u2019s Jill, Jamal, and Jose; that\u2019s three. So, we need to split the check between five.\u201d Pedro disagrees. At first, Asa thinks he\u2019s kidding. But he assures her that he\u2019s not. Puzzled Asa says, \u201cWait, there\u2019s you and me; that\u2019s two.\u201d He replies, \u201cright.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Asa says, \u201cand there\u2019s Jill, Jamal, and Jose\u2014that\u2019s three.\u201d \u201cCorrect,\u201d \u00adPedro responds. \u201cAlright, am I missing anyone?\u201d Asa asks. \u201cNope,\u201d \u00adPedro assures her. \u201cOkay, then. That makes five,\u201d she responds. \u201cWrong,\u201d \u00adPedro says. Again, Asa makes sure that he\u2019s not kidding. In exasperation, Asa\u00a0says, \u201cLook, DISAGREEMENT\u2014AGAINST EQUAL WEIGHT 197 me and you, that\u2019s two. Jill, Jamal, and Jose, that\u2019s three. 2\u00a0+\u00a03\u00a0=\u00a05!\u201d To which Pedro replies, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Noticing Asa\u2019s \u00adpuzzled ex- pression, Pedro explains that two plus three doesn\u2019t equal five. After making sure that they are using their words in the same way, Asa re- alizes that Pedro is literally disagreeing with her about \u201c2 + 3 = 5\u201d. Asa thinks that this is true, and Pedro believes that it isn\u2019t. What makes this case a particularly interesting variation of the pre- vious restaurant case is that the intuitions that people usually have in these two versions of the case are very different.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
