{"paragraph": " To be a good instance of a kind a thing or a person need only possess good-making properties sufficient to make it a good instance of its kind. To be an excellent instance of its kind a thing or a person must either ( 1) possess certain good-making properties to a higher degree than do most good instances of that kind or (2) possess some excellent-making prop\u00ad erty that merely good instances of its kind do not possess. If to be an excellent instance of its kind a thing or a person must first be a good instance, then it must possess some good-making properties the posses\u00ad sion of which is sufficient to make it a good instance of its kind. If it does not, then the possession of some excellent-making property that no merely good instance of its kind possesses would not suffice to make it an excellent instance of its kind. It would have an excellent-making property of its kind that no merely good instance of its kind has, but it still would not be a good instance because it would not possess enough of the good-making properties, the possession of some of which by an instance of its kind is necessary if the instance is to be a good instance. For example, the degree of bravery of a certain soldier, Private Smith, might be far greater than that of the typical good soldier, yet in all other respects he might be a much worse soldier than the typical soldier. Although his bravery far surpasses that of a typical soldier, he still is not a good soldier because he does not have to a sufficient degree various of the good-making properties or virtues of a soldier, the possession of which by a soldier is necessary if he is to be a good soldier. If a thing is to be a good instance of its kind it must possess at least some of the good-making properties of the kind. It is not necessary, however, that it possess all the good-making properties of its kind. Indeed, some of these properties might be such that if an instance has one it cannot also have another.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
