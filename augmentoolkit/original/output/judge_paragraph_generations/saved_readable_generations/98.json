{"paragraph": " Perhaps it would be hard to keep the mini-individuals working for very long; but suppose that we can keep the whole thing going for an hour. PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 94 Now imagine that during that hour there\u2019s a moment that you step on a piece of Lego and feel a sharp stab of pain in your right foot. The Blockhead is functionally equivalent to you for this hour, so at the very same moment that you are feeling the pain, it is in the same functional state as you. Just as you cry out and grab your foot, so too does the Blockhead cry out and grab its foot. But is the Blockhead feeling a sharp stab of pain? Is it experiencing any qualitative state at all? Insofar as we\u2019re inclined to answer no, it looks like functionalism cannot be an adequate theory of mind. DISCUSSION The Blockhead thought experiment takes its name from Ned Block, the philosopher who first proposed it in 1978. But it has often been referred to by other names as well. As Block first describes the case, the mini-individuals are referred to as \u201chomunculi,\u201d and so the thought experiment is thus often referred to as the homunculi-headed robot. Though it\u2019s now believed that the human brain contains ap- proximately 86 billion neurons, at the time Block was writing the estimate was considerably lower, about a billion neurons. So Block thought that about 1 billion homunculi would be needed. Since that roughly matched the population of China at the time, he supposes that we might recruit the entire population of China to serve as the homunculi. The thought experiment is thus also sometimes referred to as the China Nation case. The thought experiment serves as the linchpin of what Block \u00adrefers to as the absent qualia argument. The reasoning proceeds roughly as fol- lows: You and the Blockhead are in the same functional state. But you have qualia and the Blockhead does not. So the Blockhead is not in the same mental state that you are in.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
