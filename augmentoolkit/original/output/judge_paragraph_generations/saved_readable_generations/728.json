{"paragraph": " Sometimes certain of the good-making Persons, Things, and Value 99 properties of a given kind are incompatible, so that although an instance of the kind can possess one of these properties it cannot pos\u00ad sess both. Thus the properties f and g might be good-making properties of instances of the kind k, yet f and g inight be incompatible properties, so that it is impossible that any instance of the kind k have both f and g. If it were necessary that an instance of the kind k have both these properties to be a good instance of that kind, then no instance of that kind could be a good instance of it. Although the possession of one of the two properties, f and g, might be a necessary condition that any instance of the kind k must satisfy if it is to be a good instance of that kind, the possession of both these properties cannot be such a necessary condition if they are in fact incompatible properties. One can, of course, arbitrarily specify that if any instance of a given kind is to be a good instance of the kind it must have both of two incompatible properties. The concept of a good instance of that kind that would be produced by such an arbitrary procedure, however, necessarily would fail to apply to anything at all. If, in order that something be a good instance of a given kind it must have both of two, incompatible properties, then nothing can be a good instance of that kind. Language such as the preceding concerning the necessary and suffi\u00ad cient conditions that must be satisfied if a thing of a given kind is to be a good instance of that kind might suggest that whenever we regard a given instance of a given kind as a good instance of that kind we have an exact concept of, and would encounter no difficulty in formulating with precision, the necessary and sufficient conditions that must be satisfied if anything is to be a good instance of the kind in question. In fact, how\u00ad ever, almost all our concepts of the conditions that must be satisfied if any instance of a given kind is to be a good instance of that kind lack such exactness, and in the case of most such concepts we do encounter difficulty, frequently great difficulty, in attempting to specify with preci\u00ad sion the necessary and sufficient conditions that must be satisfied by an instance of a given kind if it is to be a good instance of that kind.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
