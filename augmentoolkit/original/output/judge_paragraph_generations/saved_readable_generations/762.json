{"paragraph": " Given all this, ought she to undertake the investigations that would enable her to come to know? Ought she, simply for the sake of coming to know the truth about her husband, take steps which, if taken, would lead to the destruction of the happy life she and her husband have lived with each other and with their chil\u00ad dren? Or ought she instead to endeavor to dismiss her suspicions and to avoid discovering anything that would confirm them? Here too prac\u00ad tical wisdom would seem to counsel that she choose the latter alterna\u00ad tive, even though by choosing it she does not come to know the truth about her husband, as she would if she chose the former alternative. By choosing the former alternative she learns a truth about her husband that she would not learn if she chose the latter alternative, yet if she is wise she will nonetheless choose the latter.

Silence and Deception Let us call the husband John. Those who know of his philandering and refrain from informing his wife and children of it do not thereby deceive them. To deceive others it is necessary either that I do something or that I do not do something, the doing or the no.t doing of which by me leads others to believe something. But in remaining silent about John's phi\u00ad landering I do not lead his wife and children to believe anything. The thought that he is a philanderer might never have occurred to them, and if they believe that he is not it is not my silence that leads them to believe this. This is the case even though I could lead them to believe that he is a philanderer by informing them that he is. From the fact, that is, that by breaking my silence I could lead them to believe something true, it does not follow that by remaining silent I lead them to believe some\u00ad thing false.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
