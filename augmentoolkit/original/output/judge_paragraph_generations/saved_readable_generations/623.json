{"paragraph": " Similarly, in this second sense of the term the non-obtaining of the state of affairs con\u00ad sisting of the Eiffel Tower's being in London is also a fact, even though this state of affairs is not a fact in the first sense of \"fact,\" since it does not obtain. In this second sense of the term, the obtaining of a state of affairs that obtains is a fact distinct from the state of affairs that obtains, which is a fact in the first sense of \"fact\"; and the non\u00ad obtaining of a state of affairs that does not obtain is also in this sense a fact even though the state of affairs that does not obtain is not a fact in the first sense. To some it might seem that the term \"fact\" is never used in this second sense. If, however, we substitute for the pedantic \"the obtaining ( or the non-obtaining) of the state of affairs consisting of the Eiffel Tower's being in Paris\" the ordinary expression \"the existence ( or the non-existence) of the Eiffel Tower in Paris,\" we can more easily see that \"fact\" is sometimes used in this second sense. People do, that is, some\u00ad times say such things as \"the existence of the Eiffel Tower in Paris is a 1 8 The Nature of Value fact\" and \"the non-existence of the Eiffel Tower in London is a fact\". To admit, however, the category of facts in this second sense is not to introduce another category in addition to that of the obtaining or the non-obtaining of states of affairs, since facts in this sense are nothing other than the obtaining or the non-obtaining of states of affairs. A third sense of the term \"fact\" is that in which it is used to designate true propositions. In this sense of the term, the following two sentences are equivalent in meaning: \"That the Eiffel Tower is in Paris is a true proposition\" and \"That the Eiffel is in Paris is a fact\". So also are these two sentences: \"It is true that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris\" and \"It is a fact that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris\".", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
