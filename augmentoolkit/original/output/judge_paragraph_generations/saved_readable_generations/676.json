{"paragraph": " This does not mean that it would have no application at Species of Value 57 all. A could still have utility as a means to b without being instrumen\u00ad tally good because neither it nor b ( 1) is a means to the existence or oc\u00ad currence of something inherently good or (2) leads to anyone's having an intrinsically good experience. If, however, a or b is a means to the ex\u00ad istence or occurrence of something, c, liked by someone, then c is inher\u00ad ently good, regardless of what c might be; and if a or b is a means to someone's having an experience he likes, regardless of what the experi\u00ad ence might be, then a and b each have instrumental value and not merely utility as a means to the occurrence of that experience. Thus a son's un\u00ad detected, unpunished, and never regretted killing of his father would have not only utility but also instrumental value as a means to his having his father's wealth, which for him is inherently good because he likes having it, and also instrumentally good because his father's wealth enables him to have certain experiences that for him are intrinsically good because he likes having them. In cases such as this the distinction between instrumental value and utility would have no application. Lewis is correct in pointing out that there is a difference between ( 1) a's being a means to b, when neither a nor b is an experience, (2) someone's liking or disliking a or b, and (3) someone's liking or dis\u00ad liking his experience of a or b. The son's killing of his father is a means to his having his father's wealth, neither of which is an experience; the son likes having his father's wealth and might also like killing him; and the son likes having certain experiences his having his father's wealth enables him to have. All this, however, can be acknowledged without also admitting that therefore the son's killing his father is instrumentally good, his having his father's wealth inherently good, and his having the experiences in question intrinsically good.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
