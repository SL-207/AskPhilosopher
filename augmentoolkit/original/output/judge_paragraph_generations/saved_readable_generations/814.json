{"paragraph": " If, that is, their pleasantness makes pleasant experiences good, and if their painfulness makes painful experiences bad, then pleasant experiences are good and painful experiences bad regardless of whose experiences they are. This, however, does not mean that every pleasant experience necessarily is good or that every painful ex\u00ad perience necessarily is bad. Whether a pleasant or a painful experience is good or bad depends upon the nature of whatever it is that the person who has the experience finds pleasant or painful. It is intrinsi\u00ad cally bad to be pleased that something intrinsically bad, such as un\u00ad merited suffering, exists, and \u0458ntrinsically good to be pained or dis\u00ad pleased that something intrinsically bad exists. Confronted with such objections, the \"teleological\" egoist might respond in the following way. \"It is true that neither my pleasant nor my painful experiences are good or bad simply because they are mine. Nor are my pleasant experiences good simply because they are pleasant and my painful experiences bad simply because they are painful. Instead, the pleasantness of my pleasant experiences is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition of their being good. Similarly, the painfulness of my painful experiences is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition of their being bad. Likewise, although their being mine is not a suffi\u00ad cient condition of their being good or bad, it is a necessary condition, since if they were not mine they would be neither good nor bad. There are thus two conditions that must be satisfied if my pleasant experiences are to be good. One is that they be pleasant; the other is that they be mine. Although neither of these conditions taken by itself is sufficient to make my pleasant experiences good, each is nonetheless necessary, and the two, taken together, suffice to make my pleasant experiences good. Precisely similar considerations, with of course the obvious necessary changes, apply to the badness of my painful experiences.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
