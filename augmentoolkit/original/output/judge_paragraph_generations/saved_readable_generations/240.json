{"paragraph": " The state is experiential and comes with a particular \u201cfeel\u201d for the subject\u2014there is something it is like to taste chocolate, see red, feel pain, etc. Blindsighters seem to lack this phenomenal consciousness of things in their blindspots. According to Block, in addition to phenomenal consciousness, though often inter- twined with it, is access consciousness. A state is access conscious, roughly, when the state provides information to the subject that can be used in reasoning and action\u2014information that is readily accessible to them. Blindsight can help us see that these two can come apart: the blind- sighters seem to have access to the \u201cblind\u201d contents of their visual fields, but nevertheless lack phenomenal consciousness with respect to those contents. The inference from the existence of blindsight to the separability of phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness is not entirely straightforward. Because blindsighters have to \u201cguess\u201d about the con- tents of their visual fields, and do so only when prompted, it is not clear that the information those contents contain is readily available to them for use in reasoning and action. But, according to Block, we can imagine \u201csuper-blindsighters\u201d who can prompt themselves and who can thereby know about the relevant items in their blindspots without having any conscious experience of those items. These super- blindsighters would have access consciousness without phenomenal consciousness, even if the same is not true of actual blindsighters. Block does not, and need not, deny that in typical subjects, access and phenomenal consciousness go together. Arguably, they do: when I perceive the donkey, I get usable information about the donkey, and there is something it is like for me to see the donkey. Block\u2019s point is that access and phenomenal consciousness can come apart. And, if they PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 232 can, even if they typically do not, then they are distinct features.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
