{"paragraph": " 6. Loving and Hating Because I have two ways whereas others have only one of knowing what my virtues and vices are, it might be thought that attempts at self\u00ad deception are less likely to succeed than are attempts to deceive others into believing that I have certain virtues and do not have certain vices. It seems true that attempts to deceive oneself are less likely to succeed than are attempts to deceive others who do not know us well or love us. From this, however, it does not follow that they are also less likely to succeed than are attempts to deceive those who do know us well and love us. It is easier for us to judge impartially the virtues and vices of those who do not stand in especially close relations to us than it is so to judge our own virtues and vices and those of the persons we love. Because of this it sometimes happens that those who know us best and love us most are worse judges of our character than are those who know us well but are not among those who love us most. Those who love us most, loving us as they do, are provided by their love for us with a motive for regarding us as good that those who do not love us do not have. It is hard, although not impossible, to love a person we regard as bad. Wanting those we love to be good, we are thereby provided a motive for ascribing to them various of the virtues the possession of which would make them good and for not ascribing to them various of the vices the possession of which would make them bad. Wanting those we love to be good, we are inclined to believe that they are indeed good. Being so inclined, we find it easy to overlook, to explain away, or even to fail to see in those we love various vices that those who do not love them as we do detect with an impartial eye and assess with an impartial accuracy. We also find it easy to see in those we love various virtues that remain invisible to an impartial eye.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
