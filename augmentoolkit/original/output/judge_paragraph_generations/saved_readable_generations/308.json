{"paragraph": " Dis- covering those truths required empirical investigation. Nevertheless, according to Kripke, they are necessary. What is more, they are neces- sary in a non-relative sense. They are true in all possible worlds, rather than only in some subset of possible worlds such as worlds with the same natural laws as those that obtain in the actual world. If Kripke is correct about the Queen and the gametes, then we have another a posteriori necessary truth: the truth that if the Queen exists, then she originated from g. But this case is unusual. In the cases of water and H2O, lightning and electrical discharge, etc., the necessity primarily concerns types of phenomena. By contrast, the Queen case concerns a necessary connection between what are arguably distinct individual objects: the Queen and g. Kripke\u2019s conclusion, that the Queen must have originated from g, might therefore threaten a doctrine associated with David Hume (1738/1978) that some consider a fundamental met- aphysical principle: there are no necessary connections between distinct \u00adexistences (Wilson 2010). For example, suppose a cue ball\u2019s motion causes the eight-ball to move. Because those two events are distinct PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 298 events, it\u2019s in principle possible for one to occur without the other. But the Queen and g are distinct existences no less than those two billiard-ball movements are. So, if the Humean principle is true, the Queen and g are not connected by necessity. Yet they are, if Kripke is right. Kripke\u2019s conclusion has further interesting consequences. For ex- ample, it seems to conflict with a familiar view on which one\u2019s essence is mental and one\u2019s connection to any physical body, let alone any set of gametes, is contingent (see Chapters 39, 41, and 42). Kripke\u2019s conclusion is thus consequential. Do his reflections es- tablish it? As he emphasizes, his conclusion is not refuted by the pos- sibility of someone who did not originate from g having many of the Queen\u2019s properties.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
