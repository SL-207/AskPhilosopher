{"paragraph": " Indeed, one might well argue, in Leibnizian fashion, that if that than which no greater can be conceived does in fact exist, then the created world, regardless of the degree to which it might be intrinsically bad, is still the least bad, and therefore the best, of all possible worlds, since, if it were not, God, being that than which no greater can be conceived, would not create and conserve it. Given, that is, that God creates and conserves the world, and given also that God is 52 The Nature of Value that than which no greater can be conceived, the world He creates and conserves must be the least bad, and therefore the best, of all possible worlds, regardless of the degree to which it is intrinsically bad. Even if it were as bad as Schopenhauer in certain of his philosophical moments seems to have thought, it would still be the least bad, and thus the best, of all possible created worlds, regardless of the degree to which it is intrinsically bad. It might also be mentioned in passing that Schopen\u00ad haur did not seem to be in any particular hurry to separate himself from the world, regardless of how bad in certain of his philosophical moments he believed, or pretended to hen.eve, it to be. Nor do most of the rest of us seem to be in any particular hurry to separate ourselves from it. It was maintained above that the world, considered as an all-inclusive whole, can have only intrinsic value and thus neither instrumental nor contributory value. Since it is not a part of some larger whole, it cannot contribute to the value of such a larger whole. And since it is all-inclu\u00ad sive, there is nothing outside it in relation to which it can have instru\u00ad mental value. The created world, on the other hand, can have not only intrinsic value but also contributory value, since it can contribute to the value of the all-inclusive whole containing as parts itself and God if God exists. It cannot, however, have instrumental value, since it cannot be a means to the existence of anything of which it is not a part.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
