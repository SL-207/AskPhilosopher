{"paragraph": " Since there is a difference of some importance between ( 1) liking a thing regardless of whether one also regards it as good and (2) regarding a thing as good regardless of whether one also likes it, to say only of someone that he has a pro-attitude toward a given thing might mean either of two things without specifying which of the two is meant. Since the terminology of \"pro-attitude\" and \"con-attitude\" is insufficiently specific in the respect indicated, in what follows I shall avoid such terminology and speak instead of liking and disliking things and of regarding things as being good or bad. The psychological phenomena of liking and disliking a Value and Psychological Phenomena 1 3 given thing are specifically different from those of regarding a given thing as being good or bad, and phenomena of one of these species are not reducible to those of the other. 2 Just as there are different species of pro- and con-attitudes, so also there are different species of liking and disliking-so many, in fact, that it would be a most formidable task to attempt to list them all. Being irri\u00ad tated, being terrified, and being disappointed, for example, differ specif\u00ad ically from one another, and to say that a person is irritated by some\u00ad thing when in fact he is terrified by it would be to misdescribe his experience. Yet whatever it is that irritates, terrifies, or disappoints a person is something he dislikes, as is also his being irritated, terrified, or disappointed, at least during the period of time he suffers these experi\u00ad ences. Similarly, being amused, being ecstatic, and being relieved differ specifically from one another, and to say that a person is amused by something when in fact he is ecstatic about it would be to misdescribe his experience. Yet whatever it is that makes a person amused, ecstatic, or relieved is usually something he likes, as he usually also likes his being amused, ecstatic, or relieved, at least during the span of time he has such experiences.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
