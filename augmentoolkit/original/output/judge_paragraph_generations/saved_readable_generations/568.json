{"paragraph": " What about Tuesday? Well, Aaliyah knows that the quiz can\u2019t be Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. Given this, if the quiz doesn\u2019t take place by the end of class Monday, then she would know that it is coming on Tuesday. But again that would mean that the quiz isn\u2019t a surprise. So, the quiz can\u2019t be on Tuesday. This only leaves Monday. The quiz can\u2019t be then either though, since Aaliyah knows that it isn\u2019t Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, that only leaves Monday. But, of course, if there\u2019s only one day that the quiz can be, the quiz won\u2019t be a surprise. Thus, there is no day that a surprise quiz can be given next week. After the cheers of Aaliyah\u2019s classmates end, the professor congrat- ulates Aaliyah on her clever argument. But, she informs the class that there will be a surprise quiz next week so they had better prepare for it. What makes this situation (at least seem) paradoxical is that on the one hand, it is commonsense that there can be a surprise quiz even when it is announced the week before that such a quiz is coming. Yet, on the other hand, Aaliyah\u2019s argument that there cannot be such a quiz appears sound. RESPONSES One response to the Surprise Quiz Paradox claims that the professor\u2019s announcement is self-defeating (O\u2019Conner 1948). The idea here is that her very statement undercuts itself. For example, if someone says to you in English, \u201cI speak absolutely no English,\u201d this statement is self-defeating because by speaking the sentence itself the speaker is making the statement false. This response says the same thing happens when the professor announces a surprise quiz. SURPRISE QUIZ PARADOX 229 Another response simply insists that although the professor\u2019s announcement about the quiz is true, the students (Aaliyah in- cluded) cannot know that it is true (Quine 1953). Since Aaliyah doesn\u2019t know that the announcement is true, her reasoning doesn\u2019t go through because it crucially relies upon her knowing this.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
