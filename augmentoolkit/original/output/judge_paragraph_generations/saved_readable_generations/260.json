{"paragraph": " If someone argued that there was only one self, or that there was no self when you cut your hair, they would simply be wrong. Unlike the case of the chariot, the case of the self is not conventional. Another option is to say that the chariot and the self both exist in the same sense, and there is no good sense in which either one does not exist (Thomasson 2007). Perhaps one is a natural kind and the other isn\u2019t; but just because something isn\u2019t a natural kind doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t exist, or exists in any lesser sense. This strategy is PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 252 apt to reject a crucial premise in the Buddhist\u2019s argument. The Bud- dhist argues that, in both the case of the chariot and the self, there is merely an assemblage of parts organized in a certain way. But why think that means only the parts exist and not the whole made of the parts? The chariot just is parts arranged in this way, and the self just is parts arranged in this way. The Buddhists seem inclined to disagree because they are committed to mereological nihilism, the view that there are no objects composed of parts\u2014if you put two parts together, you still just have the parts (Unger 1979). While this is counterintuitive, there are interesting arguments to that end, related to the considera- tions in the previous paragraph. It can be a vague matter of whether or not parts constitute a whole or whether the whole survives changes in its parts. Whether or not parts actually compose a thing, or whether the thing survives changes of its parts, might therefore seem to be a matter of convention rather than some objective matter of fact. Many philosophers resist mereological nihilism, but the Buddhists have plenty of contemporary non-Buddhist company in believing it (Was- serman 2021). The candle analogy raises other interesting questions, some of which are discussed in Chapters 39, 41, and 42.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
