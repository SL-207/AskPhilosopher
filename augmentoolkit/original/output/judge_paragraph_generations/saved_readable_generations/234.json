{"paragraph": " Sarah\u2019s visual experience does not. Visual experience isn\u2019t nearly as rich as we tend to think. Proponents of that conclusion also cite other evidence, such as the related phenomenon known as inattentional blindness. This happens when we fail to notice something that we would normally notice be- cause our attention is directed elsewhere. A striking example of inat- tentional blindness goes like this (Simons and Chabris 1999). Subjects are shown a video in which six people are passing basketballs. Half are wearing white and half are wearing black. Subjects are instructed to count how many times the players wearing white pass the ball. After PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 226 the video, they are first asked to report on the number they counted. Then they are asked, \u201cDid you see the gorilla?\u201d They are asked that second question because, in the middle of the video, someone in a gorilla suit walks into plain view, beats their chest, and leaves. About half of the subjects report that they did not see the gorilla! Inattentional blindness and change blindness aren\u2019t identical. Only change blindness need involve the subject comparing a display with what they remember about an earlier one. But clearly, the two phe- nomena are related, and some take both to support the view that perceptual consciousness is sparse. On this view, the reason half the people who see the basketball video deny having seen the gorilla is simple: they didn\u2019t see the gorilla, even though it was there to be seen. If perceptual experience is sparse, then why do we tend to assume otherwise? Proponents of the sparse experience have an explanation. If you even wonder whether you\u2019re seeing something in your visual field, you turn your attention to it, and then you see it. Our false as- sumption is an instance of the refrigerator-light illusion: thinking the light is always on because it\u2019s on every time you open the fridge door.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
