{"paragraph": " Many people have the intuition that in the previous case, Asa should think that it is equally likely that she made a mistake as it is that Pedro did. It is this sort of intuition that provides powerful support for the equal weight view. However, things look different in this variation of the case. Most have the intuition that Asa should think that it is clearly Pedro that has made a mistake, not her. Pedro\u2019s answer is so obviously wrong. What\u2019s par- ticularly important about this case is that it seems that, contrary to the equal weight view, Asa\u2019s evidence for thinking that it is Pedro who has made the mistake rather than her is not independent of the disagreement at hand. It is because Pedro disagrees in such an extreme way that Asa has good reason to think that it is Pedro who is making the mistake. Jennifer Lackey presented this sort of case to motivate a view that lies between the equal weight view and the steadfast view, what is called the justificationist view. According to the justificationist view, in cases of disagreement where you are very justified in believing the proposition in question before discovering the disagreement (like Asa\u2019s belief that 2 + 3 = 5, for instance), the personal access that you have to your evidence makes it clear to you that it is your friend (rather than you) who is messing up when you disagree. Notice though if this is correct, then you are able to use evidence from the disagreement itself to justifiedly disregard your peer\u2019s opinion. This is counter to the equal weight view. RESPONSES A similar view to the justificationist view is what is known as the total evidence view (Kelly 2005). According to this position, in cases of disa- greement, what you are justified in believing depends upon both your original evidence and the evidence that you gain from discovering the SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY 198 disagreement. The thought is that in cases like Bad Math, Asa\u2019s initial evidence is so strong that the evidence from the disagreement doesn\u2019t make it so that her original belief loses justification.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
