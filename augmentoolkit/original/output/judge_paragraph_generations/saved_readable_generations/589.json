Australasian Journal of Philosophy 94: 549\u2013562. 50 THE PROOF PARADOX Background: The proof paradox is an epistemological puzzle that originally arose in the context of legal theory. It concerns how we are to think about sta- tistical evidence (for example, 60% of Xs are Y) as compared to nonstatistical evidence (for example, eyewitness testimony). The issue arises because var- ious legal standards seem to be quantifiable. Two of the most common legal standards are \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d, which is often the standard used in civil lawsuits, and \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d, which is often the stand- ard employed in criminal proceedings. Preponderance of evidence is typically understood to mean anything more likely than 50%, and beyond reasonable doubt is typically taken to mean 90\u201395% odds that the person is guilty. There is a broader view in epistemology that is also important to think about when considering the proof paradox. It is what is known as \u201cproba- bilism\u201d. This is a view of epistemic justification that is commonly accepted by both internalists and externalists (see General Background: The Nature of Justification pp. 113\u2013119). Roughly, probabilism is the idea that you have justification to believe that p when your evidence makes p\u2019s truth sufficiently probable. The connection between probabilism and legal stand- ards of proof is especially clear in some theorists\u2019 views, e.g. evidentialists Earl Conee and Richard Feldman specifically suggest that having sufficient justification for knowing that p requires meeting the \u201ccriminal standard\u201d of evidence, i.e. p\u2019s truth being beyond reasonable doubt.
