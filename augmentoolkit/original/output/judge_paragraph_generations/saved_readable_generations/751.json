{"paragraph": " Chapter 7 The Primacy of Practical Rationality There is a difference between ( 1) conceiving of God as that than which no greater can be conceived, (2) believing that He exists, and (3) wanting Him to exist and hoping that He does. There is also a differ\u00ad ence between ( 1) believing that He exists and wanting Him to exist and hoping that He does and (2) beir:ig justified in doing so. The question of whether we are justified in doing so is part of a larger question con\u00ad cerning ( 1) the value of knowledge, the attainment of which is the cen\u00ad tral object of theoretical reason, and of various other values, the attain\u00ad ment of which is the object of practical reason, and (2) which of these two types of value takes precedence over the other when they conflict in such a way that they cannot both be realized. It is this question that we shall consider in this chapter. 1. The Value of Religious Belief and Hope Given that God is that than which no greater can be conceived, and given also that we ought to want and hope that the better rather than the worse exist, and that the best of the better exist, we ought to want and hope that God exist. Such want and hope, however, if we have them, can be authentic only to the degree to which we endeavor to act as that than which no greater can be conceived would act if He were in our place, although necessarily subject, of course, to our human limita\u00ad tions of knowledge and power. Such want and hope, that is, can be authentic only to the degree to which in our daily lives we endeavor to bring into being and to conserve the better rather than the worse and the best of the better. To the degree to which we do endeavor so to lead our lives we live as God Himself would live were he human and in our 1 1 7 1 1 8 The Nature of Value place, and His Divine and therefore Holy Spirit becomes incarnate and alive in each of us and animates and directs our daily lives.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
