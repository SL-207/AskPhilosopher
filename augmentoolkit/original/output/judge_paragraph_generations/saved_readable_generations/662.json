{"paragraph": " This would happen if the parts do not stand in an appropriate relationship to one another and to the whole, so that they do not fit together prop\u00ad erly. This sometimes happens in the case of bad works of art. Even tho\u0157gh each of the parts of a work of art, when taken in isolation from one another and from the whole of which they are parts, be good, the work of art itself, which is the whole of which they are parts, might Species of Value 4 7 nonetheless be bad because the parts do not fit together. Indeed, it is even possible that a work of art be go\"od even though each of its parts, taken in isolation from one another and from the whole of which they are parts, have little or no intrinsic value, provided that they fit together properly. The first part of each of the three wholes we considered above can also be a part of other wholes. Thus a fourth whole might consist ( 1) of Abraham's unjustifiably causing his parents to suffer and (2) of Isaac's being pleased that Abraham has done so; a fifth whole might consist ( 1) of Isaac's unjustifiably causing his parents to suffer and (2) of Jacob's being sorry that Isaac has done so; a sixth might consist ( 1 ) of Jacob's unjustifiably causing his parents to suffer and (2) of Abraham's being neither pleased nor sorry that Jacob has done so even though he knows that Jacob has done so. As before, the first part of each of these wholes is intrinsically bad, the second part of the fourth intrinsically bad, the second part of the fifth intrinsically good, and the second part of the sixth intrinsically bad, although not as bad as the second part of the fourth. Although the second part of the fifth whole is intrinsically good, the whole itself is intrinsically bad, since the negative value of the first part is greater than the positive value of the second part. The second part, like the first, of each of our first three wholes can also be a part of other wholes.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
