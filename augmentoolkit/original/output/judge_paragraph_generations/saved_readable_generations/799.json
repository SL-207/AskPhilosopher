{"paragraph": " Indeed, what may be referred to as the \"extreme\" moralist places little or no value on ratio\u00ad nality and might even regard it with contempt when its claims seem to him to conflict with the claims of morality. He takes a kind of Kierkegaardian either/or attitude when such conflicts occur and might 1 54 The Nature of Value also even take a certain delight in their occurrence. By contrast, the more moderate moralist and the rationalist take a kind of Hegelian both/and attitude when such conflicts occur and endeavor to resolve them either by attempting to show, as the more moderate moralist does, that it is moral to be rational or by attempting to establish, as the ratio\u00ad nalist does, that it is rational to be moral. Even so, the occurrence of at least apparent conflicts between acting morally and acting rationally is likely to cause greater discomfort for the rationalist than for even the moderate moralist. This is because one who openly places greater value on morality than on rationality is under less pressure to show that it is moral to be rational than one is under to show that it is rational to be moral if one, perhaps not so openly, places greater value on rationality than on morality. 2. Morality and Self-Interest The rationalist is under the pressure in question because ( 1) he accepts an egoistic view of rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality and (2) wants to show that it is nonetheless rational, in an egoistic sense of \"rationality,\" to act morally or to be moral, in a non-egoistic sense of \"morality\". What he must show is that each person can succeed in pro\u00ad moting his own long-term interests if and only if he acts in accordance with the requirements of a non-egoistic morality. He need not, however, show that one can promote one's long-term interests only by acting compatibly with all the requirements of any and every non-egoistic system. This would be an impossible task, since various of the require\u00ad ments of any given non-egoistic system inevitably will conflict with cer\u00ad tain of the requirements of any other such system.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
