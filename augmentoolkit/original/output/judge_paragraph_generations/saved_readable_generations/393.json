{"paragraph": " Why is this? Well, Saul\u2019s belief that his client is innocent isn\u2019t caused by his having evidence for believing this. After all, he gains the evidence, but that doesn\u2019t cause him to believe the cli- ent is innocent. Instead, the claims of the fortune-teller are what cause Saul to believe that his client is innocent. Similarly, his belief doesn\u2019t counterfactually depend upon his evidence. He gets the evidence but doesn\u2019t form the belief that his client is innocent. Presumably, if he were to not have that evidence, it would make no difference to his believing that his client is innocent. Once the fortune-teller informs Saul that his client is innocent, he\u2019s going to believe that his client is innocent. If Saul were to somehow lose all his evidence for his client\u2019s innocence but still be told by the fortune-teller that his client is inno- cent, he\u2019d still believe the client is innocent. All that seems to matter for Saul believing that his client is innocent is the fortune-teller telling him so. That all said, if Saul knows that his client is innocent (which would entail that he justifiedly believes that the client is innocent), then the basing relation cannot be a causal or counterfactual relation because his evidence doesn\u2019t bear the relevant sort of causal or coun- terfactual relation to his belief. Keith Lehrer originally presented this sort of case in an attempt to provide a counterexample to causal/counterfactual views of the basing relation. According to Lehrer, Saul does know after he sees the fortune-teller. As we saw above, this is very important, if cor- rect, because it shows that the basing relation cannot be a causal relation or a relation of counterfactual dependence. Lehrer takes this to be the lesson of this example and suggests that the basing relation is really a doxastic relation. The idea here, roughly, is that basing a belief that p on one\u2019s evidence requires that one have a belief to the effect that one\u2019s evidence provides sufficiently strong reasons to believe that p.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
