{"paragraph": " 26). Insofar as we are people who like to make that sort of leap, we can rationally and authentically opt for the new experiences. Return to the low-stakes durian case. Here one might decide to try the durian not because of what this new experience will be like, but simply for the sake of hav- ing a new experience. Adapting this solution to a high-stakes case like parenthood, Paul suggests that when we choose whether to become a parent, we should do so partly on the grounds of whether or not we want to discover new experiences and preferences. Since we can\u2019t know what the experience will be like, our choice should be based partly on the value we place on discovery and revelation. A different skeptical solution is offered by Marcus Arvan, who sug- gests that we should approach transformative experience not in terms of revelation but in terms of resilience. People who don\u2019t over-plan but instead accept life as it comes, people who are psychologically resilient, are better positioned to handle transformative experiences. From this, Arvan concludes that the most rational way to approach transformative experience would be to shape our lives such that we develop such attitudes and become resilient people. In fact, he sees re- silience as \u201can adaptive tool specifically for dealing with transformative experience\u201d (2015, p. 1200). But many other philosophers adopt a non-skeptical strategy for dealing with the puzzle. Rather than accepting that the best we can hope for is an indirect solution, they instead try to dissolve the puzzle. The Puzzle of Transformative Choice 311 Often this involves what we might think of as a partial dissolution. Such philosophers grant that there might be cases of transformative experience in which we can\u2019t make such choices rationally and au- thentically, but they argue that there are many kinds of cases in which we can. For example, Rachel McKinnon (2015) argues that someone who has come to know that they are trans and is deciding whether to undergo a gender transition might not be able to know exactly what such a transition would be like; but they might be able to know based on the information they presently have that it can\u2019t be worse than what life would be like if they didn\u2019t transition.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
