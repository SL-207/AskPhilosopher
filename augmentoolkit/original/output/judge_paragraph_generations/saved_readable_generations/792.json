{"paragraph": " Despite Hume, however, there does seem to be something irrational about preferring the destruc\u00ad tion of the world to the scratching of my finger. The first would clearly seem to be worse than the second, and if such a preference would not be irrational it is hard to know what would be. Should the Humean retort that it is hard to know what would be because no end is either more rational or more irrational than any other, the appropriate response would appear to be that some ends are more irrational than others, if 148 Morality and Rationality 149 for no other reason than that preferring the destruction of the world to the scratching of my finger is irrational. A second widely held position is the view that practical rationality consists of adopting appropriate means to the promotion of one's own long-term interests, welfare, happiness, or good. Each person acts ratio\u00ad nally if and only if, and only to the degree that, he acts compatibly with the promotion of his own long-term interests. Whereas on the first view no end is either more rational or more irrational than any other end, on this view the only ultimate end it is rational for anyone to adopt is the promotion of his own long-term welfare. Thus whereas on the first view it would not be irrational to prefer the destruction of the world to the scratching of one's finger, on the second view it would be, provided that the destruction of the world, but not the scratching of one's finger, would be incompatible with the promotion of one's own long-term hap\u00ad piness. If, however, the promotion of my own long-term good were to require that I take steps that would lead to the destruction of the world after my death, then practical rationality would require that I take such steps. Fortunately for others, die promotion of my own long-term inter\u00ad ests does not in fact require that I take such steps. It is also fortunate for others that I could not bring about the destruction of the world even if I tried.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
