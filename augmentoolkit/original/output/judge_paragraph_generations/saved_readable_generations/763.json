{"paragraph": " By my silence I lead them to believe something false only if they and I are in a situation that is such that my silence could reason\u00ad ably be taken by them as indicating that something is the case when in fact it is not the case, regardless of whether they believe prior to my silence either that it is or that it is not the case. In our example they and I are not in such a situation. If, however, John's wife, who suspects that he is philandering, asks me whether her suspicion is true, then I do deceive her if I tell her that it is not and if, by telling her this, I lead her no longer to suspect him of philandering. If, however, I tell her that John is not philandering when I know that he is, I attempt to deceive her but do not succeed in doing so if she continues, despite what I tell her, to suspect that he is. To deceive a person it is not sufficient to attempt to do so; instead, it is also necessary that I succeed in leading her to believe whatever it is that I am endeavoring to lead her to believe. From the fact, however, that there is a difference between remaining silent and attempting to deceive, and that the former is sometimes justi\u00ad fied, it does not follow that so also is the latter. The fundamental differ\u00ad ence between the two, at least in situations such as the one we have been consi\u0415ering, would seem to be that in remaining silent I do not attempt to lead another person to believe something he does not already believe, whereas in attempting to deceive him I do attempt to do this. There are The Primacy of Practical Rationality 127 other sorts of situations, however, in \u0416hich, by lying to someone, I do not attempt to lead him to believe something he does not already believe. Thus if John's wife, believing that he is not philandering but also suspecting that he might be, asks me whether he is, and if I, knowing both what she believes and suspects and also that he is philan\u00ad dering, tell her that he is not, I do thereby attempt to deceive her even though I do not attempt to lead her to believe anything she does not already believe.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
