{"paragraph": " EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE; RATIONAL DECISION THEORY Laurie is thinking about whether she should become a parent or not. At this point, she\u2019s not worried about settling on a particular method of becoming a parent\u2014natural birth, adoption, etc.\u2014but rather she is simply considering whether to become a parent at all. Laurie knows decision theory, so she decides to work out the calculations to help her gain some clarity (this is a philosopher\u2019s version of a pros and cons list!). She starts with thinking about her choice: try to become a par- ent or don\u2019t try to become a parent. And the two possible outcomes: become a parent or not become a parent. Become a parent Don\u2019t become a parent Try to become a parent A B Don\u2019t try to become a parent C D So, Laurie realizes that there are four possibilities: A, B, C, D. Now all she has to do is figure out how much she values each of these possibilities and how likely they are to occur. Unfortunately, Laurie hits a snag here. She realizes that she has no idea what it\u2019s like for her to be a parent. She\u2019s never been a parent before, and there\u2019s nothing in her life that really gives her a good sense of what it\u2019s like to be a parent. She realizes that this is something that she could only really know about if she were already a parent. So, she has no way to determine how valuable A or C is to her. To make things even more LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 106 difficult, she realizes that what she values would likely change if she were to become a parent. She knows that people\u2019s views of parent- hood often change when they become parents\u2014some change so that after becoming a parent they really like it, but others change so that they really dislike being a parent. So, Laurie realizes that becoming a parent would be a transformative experience\u2014it would change her not just in terms of becoming a parent, but also in terms of changing how she values things.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
