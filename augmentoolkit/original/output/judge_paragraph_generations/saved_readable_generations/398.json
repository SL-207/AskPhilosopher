{"paragraph": " Hence, contextualism says that what we should make of these cases is that Sally speaks correctly both times, because in the first scenario she is in a low-stakes context where it is correct to attribute knowledge to Jorge, and in the second scenario she is in a high-stakes context where it isn\u2019t correct to attribute knowledge to Jorge. RESPONSES There has been a considerable amount of empirical work on people\u2019s responses to pairs of cases like this. The goal has been to determine whether nonphilosophers think that attributions of knowledge vary with the stakes involved or not. The results are mixed. Some studies have seemed to vindicate the contextualist by suggesting that people are inclined to say that Sally is correct when she changes whether she attributes knowledge to Jorge depending upon her own situation (DeRose 2009). Other studies have seemed to suggest that actually what people track is whether the stakes are high or low for Jorge when it comes to attributing knowledge to him (Sripada and Stanley 2012). Still other studies have seemed to suggest that people are not inclined to change whether they think a knowledge attribution is CONTEXTUALISM 51 correct because of raised or lowered stakes (Buckwalter and Schaffer 2015, Rose et al. 2019). These empirical results line up with the three major responses to these sorts of cases. A response that denies contextualism but is similar, in that it main- tains that the standards for whether it is correct to attribute knowl- edge to someone changes with the stakes involved, is what has come to be known as \u201csubject sensitive invariantism\u201d or \u201cpragmatic en- croachment\u201d (Hawthorne 2004, Stanley 2005, Fantl and McGrath 2009). This response says that the relevant stakes are those of the po- tential knower. So, in the scenarios mentioned above, the pragmatic encroachment response says that whether it is true to say that Jorge knows/doesn\u2019t know that the bank is open depends upon the stakes for Jorge.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
