{"paragraph": " After all, fears about a candidate\u2019s health can sink a presidential campaign, even though it is very likely that the candidate in this case will make a full and speedy recovery. So, instead of the actual story of the candidate\u2019s heart attack, the major media outlets are told the vacation story. And it is the vaca- tion story that is all over the internet and newspapers. Liz happens to be staying at a hotel when the story comes out. As she heads to breakfast, she picks up a newspaper from the selection that the hotel staff has set out. She happens to grab the latest copy of Small Town News rather than one of the national papers. Liz reads the paper as she enjoys her breakfast. When she reads about the incident with the candidate, she comes to justifiedly believe that the candidate suffered from a major heart attack. Of course, this belief is true. So Liz comes to have a justified true belief on the basis of the testimony provided by Small Town News. But some insist that Liz\u2019s justified true belief fails to amount to knowledge because she could have so easily believed the story about the candidate being on vacation. After all, every other newspaper published the vacation story, and it is the story that is all over TV and the internet. If this is correct, it is a problem for the transmission view of testimony because the folks at the Small Town News do know that the candidate has had a heart attack and they have provided this testimony to Liz via the newspaper article, but Liz fails to come to know this after forming the belief. Hence, this case appears to be an instance where a testifier\u2019s knowledge is not sufficient for transmitting knowledge to another person. SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY 176 RESPONSES One response is to insist that Liz really does have knowledge (Lycan 1977). The thought here is roughly that this sort of case is analogous to fake barn cases (see A Strange County pp.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
