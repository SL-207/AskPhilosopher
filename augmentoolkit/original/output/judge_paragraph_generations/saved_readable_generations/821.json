{"paragraph": " This perhaps can be put by saying that most of us regard our good as consisting not only of having goods of various sorts but also in being good. We can, however, be good persons only by having various of the moral virtues and using them to act as we are required by unmitigated non-egoism to act. If so, then the promotion of what may be referred to as one's complete good requires not only that one act compatibly with one's having various goods but also with one's being a good person. For the unmitigated non-egoist it is in one's interest not only to have goods but also to be a good person. The position that a person's good consists not only in his having goods of various sorts but also in his having various of the moral virtues in a degree sufficient to make him a good person is by no means original. It can be found in Plato and Aristotle, in the biblical view that it profits a man nothing to gain the world at the cost of losing his soul, and in Kant's view that the complete good is blessedness, which is a union of happiness and good will. Although the man who gains the world at the cost of losing his soul does thereby come to have a certain good, namely the world, the cost he pays to gain it, namely his being a bad person, is so great that he profits nothing. Although a happy bad person does have a certain good, namely happiness, he lacks another good, namely being a good person. Moreover, the non-egoistic view of practical rationality advanced here, though at odds with egoistic views of such rationality prevalent in much recent moral philosophy, is also by no means original. Although not identical with Kant's view of prac\u00ad tical rationality, it nonetheless, like his, is non-egoistic and tailored to Morality and Rationality 1 71 meet the requirements of a non-egoistic view of morality. That it is so tailored cannot reasonably be found objectionable, given the argument by means of which it has been arrived at and given also that there is no antecedent impartial concept of practical rationality that is neither ego\u00ad istic nor non-egoistic.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
