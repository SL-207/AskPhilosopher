{"paragraph": " This has led many to embrace functionalism, a view on which the mental is characterized not only in terms of behavioral phenomena but also in terms of such inner states and relations. That view and some thought experiments that raise objections to it are discussed in Chapters 15 and 16. These thought experiments suggest that func- tionalism is unable to account for phenomenally conscious experi- ence (i.e., for qualia). Chapters 17 and 18 turn to a closely related set of ideas concerning artificial intelligence, though here the focus is primarily on how our mental states can have representational content rather than on how our mental states can have qualitative character. Chapter 17 centers on the so-called Turing test for intelligence, and Chapter 18 centers on a well-known criticism of the claim that run- ning a computer program is sufficient for mentality. As we saw in Part I, a main challenge for physicalist theories is whether they can explain phenomenal consciousness\u2014that is, \u00adconsciousness in the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d sense (see Chapters 4 and 5). Some argue that the problem is misconceived. In their view, \u00adphenomenal conscious- ness should be understood as a sort of representational/intentional \u00adproperty\u2014that is, a property of representing the world in a certain way. For example, on this view, the phenomenal property associated with seeing a red circle just is the property of visually representing PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 69 the presence of something that is red and circular. Some go further and argue that representational properties can be \u00adcharacterized in physicalism-friendly terms. Thought experiments used to support and challenges those ideas are discussed in Chapters 19 and 20. The debate between physicalists and their opponents assumes we have a reasonably clear understanding of what it means for something to be (or not to be) physical.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
