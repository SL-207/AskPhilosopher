{"paragraph": " If, that is, sweetness as exem\u00ad plified by ice cream is good but as exemplified by beer is bad, then it would seem that sweetness itself, taken in abstraction from any consid\u00ad eration of what does or does not exemplify it, can be neither good nor bad. From this, however, it does not follow that there are no universals at all the nature of which is such that any exemplification of them by any particular of any kind capable of exemplifying them would be good (or bad). If, however, there are such universals, it does not follow that they are themselves good (or bad) regardless of whether they are ever by anything exemplified. Even though any exemplification of them by any particular, regardless of its kind, would be good, it is still only their exemplification that would be good, not the universals themselves regardless of whether they are ever exemplified. With the exception of very abstract universals such as being self\u00ad identical, any given universal is such that it can be exemplified only by particulars of certain kinds. Few universals are such that they can be exemplified by anything and everything, regardless of its nature or kind. The nature of particulars of a given kind, regardless of the kind in ques\u00ad tion, is such that they cannot exemplify certain universals that can be exemplified by particulars of some other kind. The nature of ice cream cones and of human beings is such that ice cream cones cannot and human beings can exemplify kindness. It is good that human beings can exemplify kindness and also good that they do. And if they do they are in at least that respect good. From this, however, it does not follow that it is bad that ice cream cones cannot exemplify kindness and that none ever do. Nor does it follow that they are bad because they do not exem\u00ad plify kindness. They can and do exemplify sweetness, whereas human beings cannot. It is good that they can and that they do, and if they do they in at least that respect are good.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
