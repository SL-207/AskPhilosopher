{"paragraph": " We also contribute something, slight though it be, to the intrinsic goodness of the world by hoping that God, conceived in the Anselmian way as a being than which no greater can be conceived, does in fact exist. Not only would the existence of such a being have greater positive intrinsic value than the existence of anything else could conceivably have, it would also have greater positive extrinsic and thus total value than anything else could possibly have, since it is only such a being, in whom infinite power and goodness would be united, that would have the power and the goodness required to create the best of all possible worlds. Despite the many appearances to the contrary, this He might already have done or be in the process of doing. Even though, however, 90 The Nature of Value the positive extrinsic value of natural evils be unfailingly greater than their negative intrinsic value, so that their total value is positive, in par\u00ad ticular cases we by no means always see that this is so. In such cases, if asked what in particular justifies the occurrence of various such evils, \"the wise theodicist,\" to use language used by Roderick Chisholm in a slightly different context, \"would say that he doesn't know. \"9 Chapter 6 Persons, Things, and Value In this chapter we begin a treatment of the nature and the ground of the value of objects, as contrasted with objectives. Objects are either uni\u00ad versals or particulars. If, however, the argument of chapter 2 is accept\u00ad able, universals taken completely in abstraction from their exemplifica\u00ad tion by particulars have no intrinsic value. The objects with which we shall be concerned in this chapter are therefore particulars. The genus particular is divisible into two major species. One consists of persons, the other of things that are not persons. The terms \"person\" and \"thing\" will be construed broadly-\"person\" to refer to any human being and \"thing\" to any particular that is not a human being.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
