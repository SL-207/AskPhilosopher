But could one\u2019s consciousness also be transferred to a non-biological machine? This chapter considers that possibility, one often explored in works of science fiction. In fact, our description below is based loosely on the scenario presented in Robert Sawyer\u2019s science fiction novel, Mindscan (2005). Sawyer\u2019s example is also discussed at length by Susan Schneider (2019). We might imagine the uploading so that it occurs gradually over time. This kind of uploading is usually im- agined by way of an information-transfer process involving nano- bots. First, a single nanobot might be introduced into one\u2019s neural system to take the place of a single neuron. The process might then be repeated with a second nanobot, and then a third, until eventually there is no biological matter left and the whole \u201cbrain\u201d is simply a collection of nanobots. In the case considered in this chapter, we imagine the uploading to occur all at once. Whichever way we im- agine the case, it raises interesting questions about personal identity over time\u2014that is, about what makes it the case that A at time t1 is identical to B at time t2. 42 Mind Uploading 261 As we mentioned in Chapter 39, philosophers working on per- sonal identity tend to divide into three camps.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
