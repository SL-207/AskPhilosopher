Such words have different meanings (and so, sentences containing them have different requirements for counting as true) in different conversational contexts. For example, you may speak truly when you say \u201cthe dining room table is flat\u201d in the context of discussing where to put a vase. However, if you\u2019re discussing where to conduct an extremely sensitive experiment, then \u201cthe dining room table is flat\u201d doesn\u2019t seem true. \u201cFlat\u201d is context-\u00ad sensitive\u2014whether it is true to say of something that it is flat varies from one conversational context to another. Some have argued that \u201cknow\u201d and related terms are also context-sensitive. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: CONTEXTUALISM Let\u2019s image two scenarios. Here\u2019s the first one: Sally and her sister Sarah are on their way home Friday afternoon and trying to decide whether or not they should swing by the bank.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
