{"paragraph": " 1. Universals, Kinds, and Value In chapter 2 it was argued that none of the following abstract ontolog\u00ad ical constituents, elements, or parts of wholes can be either good or bad: ( 1) universals taken in abstraction from the question of whether they are exemplified, (2) particulars taken in abstraction from any consideration of which universals they exemplify, (3) states of affairs taken in abstrac\u00ad tion from the question of whether they obtain, and ( 4) the obtaining or the non-obtaining of a state of affairs taken in abstraction from the na\u00ad ture of the state of affairs that does or does not obtain. None of these ab\u00ad stract parts of a whole can be either intrinsically good or intrinsically bad. Each of them can, however, have contributory value, since each can contribute to the goodness or badness of some whole of which it is a part. We can go even further and say that the positive, negative, or neu\u00ad tral value of any whole is determined, at least in part, by the nature of its abstract parts. Thus whether the exemplification of a given universal 91 92 The Nature of Value by a given particular is good, bad, or indifferent is determined by the na\u00ad ture of the universal exemplified and the kind of the particular exempli\u00ad fying it. 1 Similarly, whether the obtaining or the non-obtaining of a given state of affairs is good, bad, or indifferent is determined by the na\u00ad ture of the state of affairs in question. That both the nature of the universal exemplified and the kind of the particular exemplifying it contribute to the goodness, badness, or indif\u00ad ference of the exemplification of that universal by that particular can be shown by means of an example or two. The exemplification of sweet\u00ad ness by a dish of ice cream (treating a dish 'of ice cream as a particular) is good, whereas the exemplification of sweetness by a glass of beer (treating a glass of beer as a particular) would be bad.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
