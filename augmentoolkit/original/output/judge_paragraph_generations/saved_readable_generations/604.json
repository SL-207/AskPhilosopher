{"paragraph": " As used in any of the three ways indicated above, the term \"value\" usually, if not indeed always, connotes what is sometimes referred to as \"positive\" value, as opposed to \"negative\" or \"neutral\" value. In the broadest sense of the term, to say that someone values something, x, is to say either that he likes it or that he regards it as good, and to say that x has value or is valuable is to say that it is good. Similarly, to say that some of John's values are a, b, and c is to say that he likes them or that he regards them as good. In evaluating something, however, a person is endeavoring to determine whether it has value and, if it does, whether its value is positive or negative and perhaps also to determine the degree to which it has either positive or negative value. The term \"value\" thus has both a narrow and a broad use. In the narrow sense it connotes only positive value. In the broad sense it connotes not only positive but also negative and perhaps also neutral value. To say that something has neutral value is to say that it has neither positive nor negative value. If the term \"value\" is used in the broadest possible sense, neutral value, like positive and negative value, will be a form of value, and everything will have value, since everything has either positive, negative, or neutral value. In a narrower sense of \"value,\" however, to say of something that it has neutral value or that it is neutral in value is to say that it has no value at all. In this sense of \"value,\" some things might have value and others not. Those things that h\u00b7ave either positive or negative value have value, but those things, if any, that have neither positive nor negative value have no value at all. Since to say of something that it has neutral value is to say that it has Value and Psychological Phenomena 3 neither positive nor negative value, it seems better to use the term \"value\" only in the narrower sense according to which the only forms of value are positive and negative value.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
