{"paragraph": " Whether, however, the obtaining of any given state of affairs would be good or bad depends upon the nature of the state of affairs in question. From this, however, it does not follow that the state of af\u00ad fairs itself, taken completely in abstraction from any consideration of whether it obtains, is either good or bad. This is indicated by the sub\u00ad junctive mood of the locutions I have been discussing. To say that it would be bad if John were dishonest or that it would be good if he were sighted is not to say, at least not explicitly, of anything that it is good or that it is bad. It is not to say that the states of affairs in ques\u00ad tion are good or bad regardless of whether they obtain. At the same time, however, it is still the nature of these states of affairs, taken in ab\u00ad straction from any consideration of whether they obtain, that makes (or would make) the obtaining of the first state of affairs bad and the obtaining of the second good. It was maintained above that since states of affairs that obtain are facts in the first sense of \"fact,\" and that since some such states of affairs are good and others bad, some facts, in the first sense of the term, are good and others bad. It was also contended that since the obtaining and the non-obtaining of states of affairs are also facts in the second sense of \"fact,\" and that since the obtaining or the non-obtaining of some states of a ff airs is good and of others bad, some facts in the second sense of the term are good and others bad. It was noted that to some it will doubtless seem strange to speak of facts, in either of the first two senses of the term, as being good or bad. I am now about to discuss a view that to some will seem even stranger. 3. Propositions as Bearers of Value This is the view that facts in the third sense of \"fact\" distinguished above are also such that some are good and some bad. But since facts in the third sense of the term are identical with true propositions, it would follow that true propositions are such that some are good and others bad.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
