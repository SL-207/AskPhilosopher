{"paragraph": " Such conflicts, however, do occur, just as_ they also sometimes occur between moral and aesthetic values. The claims of morality might require that a husband and father not desert his wife and children in order to devote his life to painting. Yet he might correctly believe that his art will suffer if he does not desert them. In such an unhappy situation he must choose between satisfying the claims of morality and those of art, if in fact he can produce paint\u00ad ings of considerable aesthetic value only if he does desert his wife and children. The best state of affairs would be one in which he could pro\u00ad duce paintings having the same aesthetic value without deserting his wife and children. Since, however, this best state of affairs cannot obtain, he must choose between the two alternatives confronting him. He chooses correctly only if the choice he makes results in the realiza\u00ad tion of greater value than would otherwise be realized. Regardless, however, of which choice he makes, he sacrifices something of value for the sake of something he believes has even greater value. Analogous conflicts can and sometimes do arise between satisfying the claims of theoretical reason and certain of the claims of practical reason. As before, the best state of affairs would doubtless be one in which no conflict occurs and no choice must be made. It might be the case that we ought to develop in ourselves, and also in others so far as 124 The Nature of Value we can, a character which is such that we can bear with equanimity to accept the results, whatever they might be, of inquiry conducted in accordance with the canons of theoretical reason. This, however, is more easily said than done, and it might well be the case that some people cannot do it at all. It is precisely because the character of many people is such that there are certain truths they cannot bear to face that conflicts between theoretical and practical rationality occur.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
