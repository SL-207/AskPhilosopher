{"paragraph": " Given his firm commitment to honoring con- tracts and his anxiety of what would happen if he is sued for breach NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 34 of contract, Geoff has decided he will be on the show no matter what it is. Unfortunately, it just so happens that Geoff has been selected to be a contestant on a new game show\u2014\u201cThe Quiz Show\u201d. The game for this show is straightforward. Contestants are given a quiz on a random subject, and the contestant who scores highest on the quiz wins the prize. Geoff\u2019s day in the spotlight comes. He\u2019s on stage, and the show has just begun. Luckily, the wardrobe people are very good\u2014they put him in clothes that won\u2019t show how badly he\u2019s sweating. Geoff is taking deep breaths to calm himself when the host announces that the quiz topic is World War II. This is an area of history that Geoff has studied quite extensively, so it should be a breeze for him. However, being on stage and having to take a test on top of that has made Geoff extremely nervous. As a result, his mind just goes blank. Not knowing what else to do, Geoff just quickly goes through the quiz putting in guesses for the dates of events. He doesn\u2019t believe these are correct\u2014 they\u2019re just guesses as far as he\u2019s concerned. But, Geoff figures it\u2019s best to at least complete the quiz. When all is said and done, Geoff scores very well on the quiz. He gets almost every question correct! The odds that anyone could have gotten a score as high as Geoff\u2019s by simply guessing are tremendously low\u2014so low in fact that no one believes Geoff when he says that he was guessing. They all insist that he knew the answers even though he claims he didn\u2019t believe that they were correct. A.D. Woozley and Colin Radford put forward their seminal pres- entations of this kind of example in an attempt to illustrate that belief isn\u2019t necessary for knowledge. While certainly a minority position, they are not alone in thinking that these cases constitute another sort of counterexample to the traditional account of knowledge (Lewis 1996).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
