One of the most prominent varieties of a closure principle is the one that encapsulates the idea that knowledge is closed under known entailment. To say that knowledge is closed under known entailment is to say, roughly, that if S knows that p, and S knows that p entails q, then S is in a position to know that q. On its face this sort of principle is extremely plausible. After all, it seems perfectly reasonable to think that we can easily extend our knowledge by deducing things that we know are logically entailed by things we know to be true. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE; EPISTEMIC CLOSURE Andrew and Ebony decide to take a nice relaxing trip to the zoo. They\u2019ve been enjoying the sunshine and seeing the various animals. At this point they\u2019ve come to one of their favorite animals\u2014the \u00adzebra. The area for the zebras is fairly big, so the only zebra they can see is a good distance away. Fortunately, it\u2019s still easy to see, and Andrew and Ebony can enjoy watching it as it has a snack. While they are looking at the zebra, Ebony remarks, \u201cWhat a great looking zebra!\u201d Andrew, NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 38 who has a habit of trying out things he\u2019s heard in his epistemology class on his friends, replies, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a zebra?\u201d Ebony, a bit dumbfounded, looks at Andrew and then gestures at the zebra. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a zebra. I know what zebras look like, and it\u2019s right there in plain sight.\u201d Andrew says, \u201cwell, you know Ebony, that if someone wanted to, they could paint a mule to look like a zebra.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
