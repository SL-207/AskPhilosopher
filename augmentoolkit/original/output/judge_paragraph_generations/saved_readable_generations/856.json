{"paragraph": " Yet we all know something of what happened in Germany and the rest of Europe as a consequence of the rise to power of German National Socialism. Certainly the use of their power by National Social\u00ad ists, both in their treatment of certain members of the German state and in their treatment of certain other peoples, left something to be desired from a moral point of view. This example is just one of many that could be given in support of the claim that the development to a high degree of the arts and sciences in a society is by itself no guarantee that it will unfailingly use its high civilization in morally acceptable ways. One need only think of the ways in which in the past, and to some extent also in the present, many of the black people of Africa and many of the Indians of the Americas were treated by more highly civilized Euro\u00ad peans and white Americans. The preceding does not mean, as Rousseau perhaps tended at times to think, that uncivilized societies and individuals are without excep\u00ad tion morally good and just. It is instead intended only to illustrate, by means of a few historical examples, that there is no necessary connec\u00ad tion between being civilized and being morally good that precludes a The Complete Human Good and Higher Education 199 civilized society conducting itself in .morally unacceptable ways. It is intended, in short, to show that it is indeed possible for a society to be at once highly civilized and morally corrupt. From this it does not follow that uncivilized or less civilized societies without exception are morally good and just. Yet civilized societies, because in them the arts and sciences are more highly developed, can and in point of historical fact have caused more evil to exist in the world than uncivilized soci\u00ad eties could bring about even if they tried. The power that the develop\u00ad ment of the arts and sciences brings in its wake can be used for good or ill, and because of this it is more important that civilized societies be morally good and just than it is that less civilized societies be so.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
