{"paragraph": " Yet another response to forgotten evidence that may be applicable to the problem of stored beliefs is epistemic conservatism (McGrath 2007, Smithies 2019). Since epistemic conservatism says that having a belief confers some positive epistemic status on the content of the \u00adbelief, one might appeal to it in order to say that all that matters for Kai\u2019s belief that L to be justified while he sleeps is that he has the belief. An additional response here is similar to, but importantly differ- ent from, yet another response to the problem of forgotten evidence. Some respond to the problem of forgotten evidence by claiming that the belief in question seems to the person to be something that they PROBLEM OF STORED BELIEFS 137 remember (Conee and Feldman 2011, McCain 2014). A similar move might apply here. One might argue that the reason that Kai\u2019s belief that L is justified is because he has a disposition to recall L as some- thing he remembers. A somewhat related response is to argue that just as we can distinguish between occurrent and dispositional beliefs, we can distinguish between occurrent and dispositional evidence (Piazza 2009). This response then claims that insofar as it is reasonable to ac- cept that Kai\u2019s dispositional belief that L is justified while he dream- lessly sleeps, it is equally reasonable to assume that he has dispositional evidence in support of his belief. A final sort of response involves arguing that there are in fact no stored beliefs at all (Frise 2018). This somewhat radical response ar- gues that the cognitive science of memory teaches us that memory simply doesn\u2019t function in the way that is necessary for it to be true that there really are stored beliefs rather than simply dispositions to believe. Hence, on this response there is no problem here because Kai doesn\u2019t actually believe that L while he is asleep.
