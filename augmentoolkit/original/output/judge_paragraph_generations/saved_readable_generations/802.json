{"paragraph": " The moderate moralist has no better chance than the rationalist of escaping the difficulty that confronts them both. In fact, the moderate moralist is in an even more uncomfortable position than the rationalist. This is so for the following reason. The rationalist places greater emphasis on rationality than on morality and regards the former as being more important than the latter. It is because of this that he endeavors to show that we are rationally justified in acting morally by arguing that we can promote our own long-term interests only by complying with the requirements of an acceptable non-egoistic morality. For the rationalist such compliance is required not as an end but rather as a means of pro\u00ad moting our long-term interests. Such an approach is not available to the moralist. As a moralist, he places greater emphasis and importance on morality than on rationality and therefore cannot consistently attempt to show that we ought to comply with the requirements of an accept\u00ad able non-egoistic morality because doing so is necessary as a means to an end consisting of the promotion of our long-term interests. Nor can the moralist plausibly argue that we ought to attempt to promote our long-term interests because doing so is necessary as a means to the end of complying with the requirements of an acceptable non-egoistic morality. Such an argument would treat as an end what the rationalist treats as a means and would treat as a means what the rationalist treats as an end and would have even less plausibility than the opposing ratio\u00ad nalist position. If the preceding is correct, both the position of the rationalist and that of the moderate moralist are unacceptable. Indeed, to some who see the difficulty confronting them both it might seem incomprehensible that they could also themselves see it and also believe that they can resolve it satisfactorily while continuing to accept an egoistic view of rationality Morality and Rationality 1 57 and a non-egoistic view of morality.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
