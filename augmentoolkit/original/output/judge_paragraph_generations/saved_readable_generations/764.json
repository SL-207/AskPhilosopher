{"paragraph": " In such a situation I no more, by lying, attempt to lead her to believe anything she does not already believe than I do by remaining silent, as in the other situation. But if by lying I attempt to deceive her, and if by remaining silent I do not attempt to do so, then the fundamental difference between attempting to deceive and remaining silent cannot in all cases be that in the former but not the latter I attempt to lead her to believe something she does not already believe. Just as by remaining silent I do not attempt to lead John's wife to believe anything she does not already believe, neither do I do so if I tell her that her hus\u00ad band is not philandering if she already believes, and I know that she does, that he is not doing so. What, then, is. the difference between remaining silent and attempting to deceive? It might be thought that the difference is that in remaining silent I do not do anything, whereas in attempting to deceive I am doing something. This, however, is not acceptable just as it stands. It requires a certain modification specifying that my remaining silent is not the consequence of my agreeing with others to do so. This is the case because if I have agreed with others to remain silent, and if I remain silent because I have entered into such an agreement, then my remaining silent constitutes my doing something, namely my complying with the terms of the agreement. If, however, I remain silent independently of any agreement I have made with others, my remaining silent does not constitute my doing anything, except in a very loose sense of the expres\u00ad sion \"doing something,\" according to which keeping a resolution I have silently made or doing what I believe to be right constitutes doing some\u00ad thing. In this very loose sense of the expression, I do something if I remain silent because I have silently resolved to do so or because I believe it to be the right thing to do.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
