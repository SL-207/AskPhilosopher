{"paragraph": " That facts in the third sense, and therefore true propositions, are such that some are good and others bad might seem to be indicated by the forms of certain locutions such as the following: ( 1) \"It is good that John is honest.\" (2) \"That John is honest is good.\" (3) \"It is bad that John is blind.\" ( 4) \"That John is blind is bad.\" The first two locutions are similar in form to the following locutions: (a) \"It is a fact that John Ontological Categories and Bearers of Value 25 is honest.\" (b) \"That John is honest is a fact.\" (c) \"It is true that John is honest.\" ( d) \"That John is honest is tr\u03dbe.\" If so, it will be obvious which locutions corresponding to (a)-(d) are similar in form to (3) and (4). The form of (b) clearly seems to indicate that what is said to be a fact is that John is honest. This seems also to be indicated, although perhaps less clearly so, by the form of (a). It too seems to indicate that what is said to be a fact is that John is honest. Since propositions are the ulti\u00ad mate bearers of truth and falsity,4 the forms of (c) and (d) seem to indi\u00ad cate that what is being said to be true is the proposition that John is honest. Whatever it is that is indicated by the locution \"that John is honest\" is said in ( 1 ) and ( 2) to be good, in (a) and ( b) to be a fact, and in (c) and (d) to be a true proposition. The same thing, that is, that is said by (a) and (b) to be a fact and by (c) and (d) to be a true proposi\u00ad tion is said by ( 1) and (2) to be good. If so, and if facts in the third sense of \"fact\" are identical with true propositions, then facts, again in the third sense of the term, and true propositions are such that some are good and others bad. It might, however, be objected that if some true propositions are good and others bad, then some false propositions must also be good and others bad. It is not clear, however, what one would mean by saying that some false propositions are good and others bad.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
