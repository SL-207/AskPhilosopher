{"paragraph": " But, of course, he clearly does know. You don\u2019t have to be an ace detective like Skyrms to know that the person whose head has been completely severed from their body is dead. Generally, this sort of example achieved its intended effect\u2014\u00ad showing that simple causal theories of knowledge are mistaken. This is something that even Alvin Goldman, who initially defended the sim- ple sort of causal theory, accepts. However, this realization didn\u2019t lead to the complete abandonment of such theories. Instead, proponents of such views added various restrictions to the relevant causal processes. RESPONSES Some causal theorists responded to these sorts of examples by add- ing that if the fact that p is overdetermined (roughly, this means that there is more than one cause in play and any of those causes would ensure that p is true), an overdetermining cause can allow one to know that p. For example, in the above case, the person\u2019s death is \u00adoverdetermined\u2014the heart attack actually killed them, but even if it hadn\u2019t, having their head severed certainly would have done so (Swain 1972, 1978). Hence, on this sort of view, Skyrms counts as knowing that the person is dead because his belief is caused by an overdeter- mining cause of the fact that the person is dead. A different revision to the causal account holds that one knows that p when one\u2019s belief that p is caused by the information that p (Dretske 1981). This would also seem to avoid the above problem, because the information that the person is dead is causing Skyrms\u2019 belief even though the cause of the person\u2019s death isn\u2019t. On this view, plausibly Skyrms knows that the person is dead, but he doesn\u2019t know the cause of the person\u2019s death. Finally, the most prominent revision to simple causal theories came from Goldman (1976, 1979, 1986) himself when he developed his theory of reliabilism (see General Background: The Nature of Justification pp.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
