{"paragraph": " Whether it can be or not depends upon the nature or kind of the property in question. 2. Extrinsic Value and Utility It was maintained above that if the obtaining of a given state of affairs, x, has positive or negative extrinsic value, then there must be some other state of affairs, a, the obtaining of which has or would have pos\u00ad itive or negative intrinsic value, and that it is from its relation to a that x acquires whatever extrinsic value it has. This means that I am using the expression \"extrinsic value\" in a narrower sense than that in which it is sometimes used. This is so because it is sometimes used in such a way that anything that can be used to attain some end has extrinsic value as a means of attaining the end in question regardless of whether the latter has any intrinsic value at all. In this sense of the expression, the use of poison might be extrinsically good as a means of killing someone regardless of whether killing that person has any intrinsic value at all, and also even if the killing of him were intrinsically bad. C. I. Lewis, who uses the expression \"extrinsic value\" in essentially the same way in which I have been using it, has suggested that we speak of a thing's utility rather than of its extrinsic value when we wish to speak of its usefulness as a means of attaining some end, regardless of whether the end we seek has any intrinsic value at all, whether positive or nega\u00ad tive, and regardless also of whether the end we seek has any extrinsic value as a means to attaining some further end that has intrinsic value. 1 I suggest that we follow his suggestion, since there is a difference between ( 1) something's standing in a certain relation, R, to something else that is intrinsically good or bad and (2) something's standing in that relation, R, to something else regardless of whether the latter has any intrinsic value at all. Following Lewis' suggestion, I shall say that poi\u00ad soning a person has utility or is useful as a means of killing him, regard\u00ad less of whether killing him has any intrinsic value at all, whether posi\u00ad tive or negative.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
