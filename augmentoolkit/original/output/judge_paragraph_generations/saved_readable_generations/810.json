{"paragraph": " If this is correct, then the question of whether we ought to accept some egoistic or instead some non-egoistic view of morality cannot properly be answered by arguing that practical rationality requires that we adopt one view rather than the other. Instead, we can properly determine what practical rationality requires of us only by determining first, by means of moral argument, whether we ought to adopt an egoistic or a non-egoistic view of morality. It is only by means of such moral argument that the abstract and relatively empty concept of practical rationality can be given adequate content. 3. The Inadequacy of Egoism Let us begin by asking whether there are any good reasons for accepting an egoistic morality. If what was said above is correct, it will not do to say that we ought to do so because it is rational so to do. Nor will it do to say that it is so evident that we ought to do so that there is no need to supply reasons for so doing. This, I think, will be evident if we put the question in a more explicit way. Why ought each person to seek as an ultimate end only the promotion of his own interests, regardless of the effect on others? Why, that is, does a person act rightly if and only if, and only to the degree that, he acts compatibly with the promotion of his own welfare, regardless of the effect on others? The phrase \"regardless of the effect on others\" is important. It indicates that the fundamental contention of the egoist is that each person ought to seek as an ultimate end nothing other than the promotion of his own good and that each person acts rightly if and only if he acts compatibly with the attainment of this end. The egoist recognizes that there are situa\u00ad tions in which a person can act compatibly with the promotion of his own interests only if he acts compatibly with the promotion of the inter\u00ad ests of certain other people and that in such situations a person acts rightly only if he does the latter.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
