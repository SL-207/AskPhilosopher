{"paragraph": " A similar response insists that there are two senses of justification. There is what we normally call \u201cjustification\u201d, which this response claims is necessary for knowledge and accurately described by eviden- tialism, and there is \u201crobust justification\u201d (Matheson 2020). Robust justification requires that one\u2019s evidence gathering be responsible in addition to the requirement that the evidence support believing the proposition in question. According to this response, cases like that of Andrea and Rich don\u2019t show that evidentialism is false, but instead reveal that there is another sort of justification\u2014the robust kind\u2014that isn\u2019t necessary for knowledge yet still important. A further response put forward by a number of evidentialists claims that while it is correct that Andrea\u2019s criticism is appropriate, it isn\u2019t be- cause of any lack of justification on Rich\u2019s part (Conee and Feldman 2011, McCain 2014, Stapleford and McCain 2020). The idea here is that evidentialism is correct in maintaining that Rich\u2019s justification for believing that the show starts at a particular time depends solely upon the evidence that he has, i.e. it doesn\u2019t matter that he could easily have had additional evidence. All that matters is that Rich has evidence that UNPOSSESSED EVIDENCE 147 supports believing that the show starts at 9pm. That said, this response goes on to claim that Rich can still be criticized for being a poor epistemic agent. He would be much better off as an epistemic agent were he to gather evidence that is readily at hand in such situations. Nonetheless, this response contends that Rich\u2019s general failings as an epistemic agent do not bear on what he has justification to believe at any particular time.
