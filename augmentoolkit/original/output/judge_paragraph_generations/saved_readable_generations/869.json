{"paragraph": " This question is most frequently raised in response to the view that moral values ought to be taught. There is, of course, some disagreement among moral philosophers concerning spe\u00ad cific moral issues and about what counts as good moral reasons and what does not. There is also, however, some disagreement among art, literary, and music critics concerning the value of particular pieces of art, literature, or music. There is also some disagreement in various of the sciences concerning the value of particular theories and a pp roaches, such as the disagreement among psychologists concerning the value of behavioristic as opposed to Freudian approaches to their discipline. And just as there is considerable agreement among art, literary, and music critics concerning the value of certain pieces of art, literature, or music that are all but universally recognized by the experts to be good, and considerable agreement among scientists that certain theories within their disciplines have been abundantly confirmed or decisively refuted, so also there is considerable agreement on the part of moral philosophers and on the part of the ordinary man in the street that cer\u00ad tain traits of character are virtues and others vices. Indeed, the entire educational enterprise and scholarly and scientific inquiry depend for their flourishing upon the widespread acceptance by scholars, scientists, teachers, and students of the value of being honest, impartial, and hard\u00ad working and on the widespread acquisition and practice by them of these virtues. Another objection that might be made to the view that colleges and universities have a duty to help their students become good persons is that it is impossible for one person or group to make another morally good. This objection, however, rests on a misconception. I agree that no person or group can make another morally good. Neither can one The Complete Human Good and Higher Education 209 person or group make another a good poet, painter, musician, philoso\u00ad pher, mathematician, or scientist.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
