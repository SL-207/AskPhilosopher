Dordrecht: Kluwer, 13\u201327. 9 SAUL THE SUPERSTITIOUS LAWYER (KNOWLEDGE AND BASING) Background: To appreciate this thought experiment, we have to first think about the basing relation. It is common to distinguish between things you have justification for believing (what is called \u201cpropositional justification\u201d) and things you justifiedly believe (what is called \u201cdoxastic justification\u201d). You can have justification for believing something even if you don\u2019t actu- ally believe it. Hence, you don\u2019t automatically justifiedly believe everything that you have justification for believing. In fact, in some cases you might have justification for believing something and believe it, but still fail to justifiedly believe it! A very brief excursion into the realm of ethics might be helpful\u00a0here.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
