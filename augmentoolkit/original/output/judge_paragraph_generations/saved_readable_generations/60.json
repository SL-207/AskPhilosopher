{"paragraph": " Perhaps it can be explained by interference from other planets, or perhaps it can be explained by the existence of space dust. Sure, no evidence of space dust has been found, but it\u2019s probably just a matter of time. From the perspective of the astronomy team, this is a problem that should be relatively easy to solve given enough time and study. But consider another problem that interests the team\u2014namely, figuring out the composition of stars. As much as they would like to tackle this prob- lem, they simply don\u2019t see how one could ever attain the kind of sample that one would need to do the analysis. It\u2019s not just a matter of needing more time and study. As a result, they\u2019re inclined to view the problem as extremely hard; so hard in fact, that it might well be impossible to solve. In fact, both the \u201ceasy\u201d problem of Mercury\u2019s precession and the \u201chard\u201d problem of stellar composition have now long been solved. Moreover, the astronomers were wrong in their judgments about the comparative difficulty of the two problems. The development of spec- troscopic analysis (a procedure that measures the radiation emitted by stars) made it a relatively straightforward matter to determine that stars are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. This result was The Hornswoggle Problem 57 surprising, since these are the two lightest elements, and planets like Earth are composed of heavier elements such as iron, nickel, silicon, and aluminum; so the discovery was initially greeted with skepticism. But, as surprising as the result was, solving the problem itself proved to be much less difficult than had been thought. In contrast, solving the problem of Mercury\u2019s precession turned out to be considerably harder than had been thought. Solving it was not just a matter of discovering the source of interference, but required a conceptual revolution\u2014 namely, Einstein\u2019s development of relativity theory.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
