{"paragraph": " After all, can\u2019t people know that they are looking at zebras when they see them at the zoo? DRETSKE\u2019S ZEBRA/DISGUISED MULE 39 Fred Dretske originally presented this case as a counterexample to closure. The thought being that we seem forced to deny one of these three: Ebony knows that the animal is a zebra; Ebony doesn\u2019t know that the animal isn\u2019t a cleverly disguised mule; knowledge is closed under known entailment. Dretske argued that the best option was to deny the third claim, that is, deny closure. This wasn\u2019t simply because of this sort of case, though. Dretske\u2019s account of knowledge where (roughly) one knows p when p is true and S believes p for conclusive reasons, i.e. for reasons that wouldn\u2019t hold if p were false, entails that closure is false. (Note there are similarities between Dretske\u2019s view of knowledge and Robert Nozick\u2019s sensitivity account of knowledge, which also requires denying closure; see A Strange County pp. 16\u201320 and Red Barns and Blue Fa\u00e7ades pp. 21\u201324.) Of course, one might wonder how we are to ever know by looking that an animal is a zebra on Dretske\u2019s view since it seems that our reason (how it looks) could obtain even if the animal is a cleverly disguised mule. For Dretske the answer is to adopt a relevant alternatives view of knowledge. Basically, the idea here is that in order for a reason to count as conclusive it has to rule out all relevant alternatives, and in many contexts the alternative that the animal is a cleverly disguised mule is simply not relevant. RESPONSES Most epistemologists do not follow Dretske in denying closure. Some argue that in this case, it is actually intuitive that Ebony really does know that the animal is not a cleverly disguised mule \u00ad(Vogel 1990, Feldman 1995). The thought is that the very reasons that make it so that Ebony knows that what she sees is a zebra also make it so that she knows that she\u2019s not looking at a cleverly disguised mule.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
