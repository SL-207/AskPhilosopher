{"paragraph": " This question was initially proposed to John Locke in a letter from William Molyneux in 1688, though there are historical antecedents in both Lucretius and Ibn Tufayl (Ferretti and Glenney 2021, Scalas 2021, Goodman 2021). Throughout the many centuries of \u00addiscussion, a number of modifications and refinements have been made to \u00adMolyneux\u2019s problem (Van Cleve 2007). Diderot suggested it would be better to ask if the subject could visually identify a circle versus a square to avoid problems of depth perception. Leibniz suggested that the subject be told that one of the items being displayed is the cube and the other is the sphere, and be given time to work out which is which. As this suggests, there are really two different questions one might ask: first, whether the person could know immediately by sight alone which was the cube and which the sphere; and, second, whether the information provided by sight, combined with the information recalled from touch, could be used to reason to the correct \u00adconclusion. The various refinements and interpretations of the problem have led some philosophers to divide it into a group of sub-problems (Mat- then and Cohen 2020). For example, there are questions about the relationship between the way sensory modalities represent space more generally, as well as questions about how vision and touch represent shape (Evans 1985). There are also questions about the relationships between the properties represented by touch and by vision\u2014whether they are in fact the same property. DISCUSSION In its original presentation, Molyneux\u2019s problem was considered a thought experiment, to be answered by philosophical theories of per- ception and the source of ideas. But the question he asked Locke seems to be an empirical one that can potentially be answered by experiment. Though these approaches are related, we\u2019ll focus on the philosophical approaches first, and then consider some of the empir- ical results.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
