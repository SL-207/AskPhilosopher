{"paragraph": " A final sort of response is to adopt what is called \u201cepistemic con- servatism\u201d (McGrath 2007, Smithies 2019). Epistemic conservatism is the idea that having a belief confers some positive epistemic status on the content of the belief. More simply put, epistemic conservatism holds that beliefs are innocent until proven guilty. So when it comes to Belle\u2019s belief now, epistemic conservatism says that her belief is justified until she has reasons to think it isn\u2019t true or was in fact un- reliably formed. The same is true of Bill\u2019s belief now according to epistemic conservatism. RECOMMENDED READING GENERAL OVERVIEWS Memory. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
