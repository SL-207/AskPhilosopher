{"paragraph": " Such satisfaction and contentment in turn normally develops, at least in the case of the reflective person, and perhaps also in the case of the unreflective, into gratitude for the way the world and the things in it normally are and into feeling at home in the world and among the things in it. A failure to recognize and appreciate the good\u00ad ness of the normal, and to believe instead that only the better than the normal is and can be good, also has its attendant phenomena. To believe that only those instances of a given kind can be good that are better than most instances of the kind leads, if one recognizes the impli- Persons, Things, and Value 97 cations of such belief, to a perpetual dissatisfaction with the way the world and the things in it normally are. It is hard to be and to feel at home in a world one believes to be populated with things most of which necessarily cannot be good instances of their kinds if it is in fact true that only those things that are better than most instances of their kind can be good instances of their kind. It is hard, that is, to be satisfied or content in a world one believes to be populated mainly by things that are not and cannot be good instances of their kind. But that the world would be so populated would be the case necessarily if to be a good instance of a kind is to be better than most instances of the kind, since then it would be impossible that most instances of any kind be good. The believer in such a world would thereby be provided with a far longer list of items for a litany of lamentations, to use a phrase of Hegel's, than that provided those who recognize the goodness of the normal. I have been emphasizing the goodness of the normal partly because value theorists frequently neglect such goodness. The emphasis I have placed on it is in no way intended to deny the goodness of those instances of a kind that are better than most instances of the kind.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
