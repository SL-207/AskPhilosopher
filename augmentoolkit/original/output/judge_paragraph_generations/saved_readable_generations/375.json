{"paragraph": " The stranger happens to have lived in New York City all her life, and she not only knows Manhattan like the back of her hand, she is excellent at giving directions. She gives Bob great directions. She tells him that the Empire State Building is only about half a mile away from where they\u2019re standing. All he needs to do is walk down 42nd Street, take a left onto 5th Avenue, and in about eight blocks he\u2019ll be there. Bob forms a true belief about how to get to the Empire State Building immediately on the basis of the woman\u2019s testimony. As examples in philosophy go, this one is pretty mundane. This case could easily happen because this sort of thing really does happen quite frequently\u2014people ask strangers for directions when they\u2019re in an un- familiar city. What makes the example of interest is that it seems that Bob knows the directions to the Empire State Building, but he\u2019s simply accepting what he\u2019s told from someone he doesn\u2019t know\u2014he didn\u2019t even ask if she was from New York City! Thus, it doesn\u2019t seem that Bob really deserves credit for believing the truth about how to get to the Empire State Building. If this is correct, then credit views of knowledge are in serious trouble. This would be a case where someone has knowl- edge, but believing truly isn\u2019t something that can be credited to them. RESPONSES A response that doesn\u2019t involve abandoning the credit view of knowl- edge insists that Bob doesn\u2019t really have knowledge in this situation (Riggs 2009). The thinking here is that Bob just picked someone at CREDIT VIEW OF KNOWLEDGE 27 random and accepted what he was told. This way of forming beliefs, the response goes, is too permissive to generate knowledge. Hence, while Bob doesn\u2019t deserve credit for believing truly, it isn\u2019t a problem for credit views of knowledge because Bob doesn\u2019t have knowledge. Alternatively, another way of responding is to allow that Bob does have knowledge in this case but insist that he also deserves credit for believing truly.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
