PART V PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF Introduction This section concerns several related problems about persons that are often grouped together under the heading of the problem of personal identity. One such problem concerns the nature of persons: What makes something a person? Another such problem concerns personal identity over time: What makes person A at a given time the same person as person B at another time? Connected with these questions about the nature of persons are also questions about selfhood and the nature of the self. As we saw in the introduction to Part I, contemporary discussions of the mind\u2013body problem in the western tradition often trace to Descartes. In contrast, contemporary discussions of the problem of personal identity in the western tradition tend to trace to a different philosopher living in the 17th century, John Locke. On Locke\u2019s view, a person is \u201ca thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself.\u201d This definition leads him to a view of personal identity over time that focuses on continuity of psychology, and, in particular, on continuity of memory. Locke motivates his mem- ory theory of personal identity by way of a body-swapping thought ex- periment. If, via a mysterious body swap, the memories of the prince were to come to reside in the body of the cobbler, and vice versa, DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-44 PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 238 which person is which? We discuss this thought experiment, and what it shows us about personal identity over time, in Chapter 39. Just as Descartes\u2019 discussion of the mind\u2013body problem did not come out of nowhere, Locke\u2019s discussion of the problem of personal identity did not come out of nowhere. Some precedents come from earlier in the western tradition. For example, the 6th-century Roman philosopher Boethius had defined personhood in terms of the notion of \u201ca rational nature.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
