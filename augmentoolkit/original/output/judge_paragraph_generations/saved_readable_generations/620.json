{"paragraph": " To use the lan\u00ad guage of Meinong, without necessarily attaching to it precisely the same meaning he did, such categori\u043ds are species of either of two genera\u00ad objects and objectives. The categories of universals and particulars are species of objects. W. D. Ross identifies objectives with facts, and sug\u00ad gests that \"the things that have ultimate value are facts. \" 1 But, as will appear, the term \"fact\" has different senses, to distinguish between which it is necessary to distinguish between states of affairs, the obtaining and the non-obtaining of states of affairs, and propositions, each of which I shall take to be species of objectives. The central ques\u00ad tion I shall address is that of which of these categories of objects and objectives are bearers of intrinsic value and which are not. I shall assume that for the purposes of this chapter the distinction I intend between the two species of objects-universals and particulars-will be sufficiently clear. 2 The argument, however, will require a short ontolog\u00ad ical excursion concerning the nature of the various species of objectives and their relationships to one another. 1. States of Affairs, Propositions, and Facts A state of affairs is or consists of something's being, doing, or having something. States of affairs are neither true nor false. Instead, they either obtain or do not obtain. If one believes that a given state of affairs obtains when in fact it does or that it does not obtain when in fact it does not, then one's belief is true. But if one believes that a given state 1 5 1 6 The Nature of Value of affairs obtains when in fact it does not or that it does not obtain when in fact it does, then one's belief is false. States of affairs are there\u00ad fore distinct from and not reducible to beliefs, although someone's believing that a given state of affairs obtains is a state of affairs that obtains at a given time. Although a person can believe that a given state of affairs obtains, the state of affairs itself is not a belief but instead is that which is believed to obtain.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
