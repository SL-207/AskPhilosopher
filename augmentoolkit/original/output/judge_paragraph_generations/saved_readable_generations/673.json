{"paragraph": " Thus if an instance of a given type of experience is liked by one person, and if another instance of that type of experience is disliked by a second person, the first instance is intrinsically good relative to or for the first person and the second intrinsically bad relative to or for the second person even though the two instances are instances of the same type of experience. But although instrumental and contributory value, like inherent value, are relative in the senses indicated, they are nonetheless objective in a sense in which inherent value would not be. Whether a has instru\u00ad mental value as a means to b, and whether x has contributory value as contributing to the value of some whole, y, are independent of anyone's Species of Value 5 5 experiences and beliefs. Either a does or it does not have instrumental value as a means to b, and either x does or it does not have contributory value as contributing to the value of some whole, y, regardless ( 1) of whether anyone believes that they do and of whether anyone has any experience of a, b, x, or y and (2) of whether anyone would believe that they do were he to have experience of them. Something, a, cannot both have and also not have instrumental value as a means to b, and some\u00ad thing, x, cannot both have and also not have contributory value as con\u00ad tributing to the value of some whole, y. Should someone believe that a is a means to b when in fact it is not his belief would be false, and should someone believe that x contributes to the value of y when in fact it does not he too would be mistaken. Similarly, whether a is a means to b and whether x contributes to the value of y is independent of whether anyone who has experience of a, b, x, or y likes or dislikes them and of whether anyone would do so were he to have experience of them. The situation is radically different in the case of inherent value. Such value would be subjective in a sense in which instrumental and contrib\u00ad utory value are not.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
