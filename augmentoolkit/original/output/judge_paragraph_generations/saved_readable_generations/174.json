{"paragraph": " He moved on to a more troubling source of doubt, however. Suppose there was an evil demon fooling him at every turn, generating the sensations of warmth and the crackling of the fire. There would be no guarantee in that case that he had ever experienced such things, or even the qualities involved: It could all be a trick of the demon. Descartes\u2019 thought experiments are commonly thought to have an epistemological upshot. Because you can\u2019t know you aren\u2019t fooled by an evil demon, you can\u2019t know much of anything. At least when it comes to the world you know by your senses, you could be systematically deceived. If you are being systematically deceived, then you merely 27 CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 168 think you are sitting at a desk reading a book because you have a series of sense impressions caused by a deceptive demon. There is no book and no desk. But there are other ways to view Descartes\u2019 thought experiments. Berkeley, for example, can be seen as drawing a different moral. Put very roughly, Berkeley (1713) argues that there is nothing more to the \u201cexternal world\u201d than sense impressions, and that, viewed a \u00adcertain way, the evil demon world isn\u2019t really a skeptical scenario at all. It\u2019s merely a world with a different metaphysical foundation than we thought. Instead of tables and chairs being constituted by mind-independent matter, they are constituted by the very ideas we have of them. They are just collections of ideas. We might say that, for Berkeley, the demon involved isn\u2019t evil\u2014it is God, who has no interest in tricking us. But the crucial move is the claim that we\u2019re not necessarily being tricked at all in this scenario\u2014the world of desks and chairs is simply con- stituted differently than we thought. This sort of approach has been explored more recently in connection with Putnam\u2019s (1981) brain in a vat thought experiment.
