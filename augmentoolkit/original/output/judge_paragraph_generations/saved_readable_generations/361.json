{"paragraph": " Yes, the person is clearly dead. However, losing their head isn\u2019t what killed them. What actually hap- pened was that the person was walking home from a party late at night when they heard a frightening sound. The person ran, tripped over a stone and fell to the ground. While lying there on the ground, the person became so frightened that they had a massive heart attack. Since there was no one around (the sound was simply the wind blow- ing through old chimes that had been left in some nearby trees), the person wasn\u2019t taken to the hospital. As a result, the person died of the heart attack. Unfortunately, the gruesome tale doesn\u2019t end there. A few hours later, after the person had been dead for quite some time, a deranged psychopath happened by the person\u2019s body and decided it would be fun to cut the head off. Of course, having just arrived on the scene, Skyrms isn\u2019t aware of all of these grisly details. He simply sees that the body and head are separated by a few feet and comes to believe that the person is dead. Why does this example and its grisly details matter? Because it poses a significant problem for simple causal theories of knowledge. The reason is that in this case, it is clear that Skyrms knows that the person is dead. However, the fact that leads Skyrms to believe that the person is dead is that the person\u2019s head has been severed. But, the fact that the person\u2019s head has been severed isn\u2019t actually a cause of this person\u2019s death. So, the fact that the person died doesn\u2019t cause Skyrms\u2019 belief. Additionally, the fact that the person is dead isn\u2019t causally re- sponsible for Skyrms\u2019 belief that their head has been severed. Hence, it seems that the fact the person is dead is neither a cause of Skyrms\u2019 be- lief that they are dead nor does it have a common cause with Skyrms\u2019 belief. As a result, the simple causal view that we discussed in the background yields the result that Skyrms doesn\u2019t really know that the NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 14 person is dead.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
