If someone says \u201cThe Eiffel Tower is made of iron,\u201d we don\u2019t need to know who said it or when in order to know what they are talking about. Other expressions are more sensitive to context. The words \u201cI,\u201d \u201chere,\u201d and \u201cnow,\u201d for example, refer to different people, places, and times depending on their context of utterance. When you say \u201cI am standing\u201d and I say \u201cI am standing,\u201d we\u2019re saying different things despite using the same words in the same ways. Though this sounds like a merely linguistic issue, there seem to be indexical thoughts as well: You and I can both have the belief that we would each express by saying \u201cI am standing,\u201d and we\u2019d be thinking different things. What is the nature of indexical thoughts? Issues surrounding indexical thought bear on two interesting is- sues in the philosophy of mind. The first has to do with whether the world can be completely grasped from the objective perspective: Does the \u201cview from nowhere\u201d (from no particular perspective; see Nagel 1986) leave something out? The second has to do with the issue of self-awareness. Descartes thought that \u201cI am thinking\u201d is one of the most certain pieces of knowledge that there is. This is an in- dexical thought, however, so understanding the nature of this certain 47 The Essential Indexical 291 piece of knowledge\u2014and consequently understanding the nature of self-awareness\u2014requires understanding indexical thought.
