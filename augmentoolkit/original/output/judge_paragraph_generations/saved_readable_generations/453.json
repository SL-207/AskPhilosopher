{"paragraph": " Hence, something that she highly values now might be something that she doesn\u2019t value much at all after becom- ing a parent, and vice versa. But, this means that even if Laurie could somehow figure out how valuable A and C are to her now, she can\u2019t know what their values for her would be after she became a parent. It seems that in this sort of choice, where the choice leads to a trans- formation of this kind, Laurie can only get the information that she needs to make the rational decision after the choice has been made. How in the world is she going to rationally make this decision? When L.A. Paul brought this sort of case to light, she proposed that we acknowledge that Laurie is in a position where she simply can\u2019t tell what she should do using decision theory. According to this response, this limitation of decision theory doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t helpful here though. Rather, this response suggests that what Laurie really needs to do is apply decision theory to a different choice: discovering what it is like to become a parent or not discovering this. It seems that Laurie can know how valuable it is to discover something like this before she knows what it is like to become a parent. So, she can make use of the tools of decision theory when it comes to this choice and that can help her to rationally decide whether or not to try to become a parent. RESPONSES A different way of responding to this challenge for decision theory in- volves arguing that the problem lies in the fact that the possible outcomes in this case are being represented in a way that is too coarse-grained \u00ad(Pettigrew 2015, 2016). This response suggests that rather than simply considering the outcome \u201ctry to become a parent and succeed,\u201d say, \u00adLaurie should consider various values for success in her calculations. For example, the possibilities should include things like try to become a parent and succeed and success becomes very valuable, try to become a parent and succeed TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE 107 and success becomes slightly valuable, try to become a parent and succeed and success becomes slightly disvaluable, and so on.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
