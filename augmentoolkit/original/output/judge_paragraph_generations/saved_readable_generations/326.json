Normally sighted humans have an anatomical blind spot corresponding to the place where the optic nerve is attached to the retina. Constitution\u2003 A thing\u2019s constitution is what makes it up.

Content\u2003 What is represented as being the case. For example, the content of the belief that Biden is the president of the United States in 2023 is the proposition that Biden is the president of the United States in 2023. One can hold different attitudes toward that same proposition. For example, one could not only believe that Biden is the president of the United States in 2023 but also desire that Biden is the president of the United States in 2023. See also proposition, propositional attitude. Contingent\u2003 A proposition is contingent if it need not have been the case. For example, the claim that all frogs are happy is \u00adcontingent. Even if all frogs happen to be happy, this is not a necessary truth; it might have been the case that not all frogs are happy. By \u00adcontrast, the claim that all frogs are frogs is necessary\u2014 that is, not contingent. Disposition\u2003 A tendency to do something or to behave in a certain way. For example, salt has the disposition to dissolve in water. Dualism\u2003 The theory that the mental and the physical are funda- mentally distinct. See also property dualism, substance dualism. Epiphenomenalism\u2003 The theory that mental states or proper- ties are by-products (effects) of physical phenomena but do not themselves have any effects on the physical world.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
