{"paragraph": " There is perhaps a problem though. It seems that this sort of response might fit the letter of internalism, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be in the right spirit. Many think that it runs counter to internalism to make justification de- pend upon things that are outside of the person\u2019s current mental states. A different sort of internalist response is to accept a version of coherentism (Poston 2014). Coherentism is roughly the view that a belief is justified when it coheres sufficiently well with one\u2019s other beliefs. So, coherentists would say of Belle that her belief is justified now because, although she has forgotten her initial evidence for this belief, she has lots of evidence in terms of how well the belief coheres with other things she believes (such as that she wouldn\u2019t form a belief for no reason; that fruits and vegetables tend to be healthy; etc.). When it comes to Bill\u2019s belief, what coherentism says will depend upon fur- ther details concerning Bill\u2019s other beliefs. So, it may turn out on this response that Bill\u2019s belief is justified too. It will all come down to how well his belief about avocados coheres with the rest of his beliefs. A different sort of internalist response says that beliefs in cases of forgotten evidence can be justified by a seeming to recollect (Conee and Feldman 2001, 2011, McCain 2015). The idea here is that Belle\u2019s belief about avocados is justified now because when the belief comes to her mind, it seems to her that she is remembering this as something JUSTIFICATION 132 that is true or even something that she knows to be true rather than something that is just coming to her mind. According to this response, there is something importantly different about the phenomenology of seeming to remember something and the phenomenology of simply considering something or forming a belief for the first time. It may be that the same is true of Bill when his belief about avocados comes to mind, so this response allows that Bill\u2019s belief might be justified as well.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
