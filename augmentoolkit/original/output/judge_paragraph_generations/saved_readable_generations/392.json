{"paragraph": " Later that evening, in an attempt to clear his head, Saul goes to visit a fortune-teller. The fortune-teller, who knows nothing about the ev- idence related to the trial and has absolutely no real fortune-telling powers, tells Saul that his client is innocent of the fourth crime. Saul has plenty of evidence for believing that fortune-tellers don\u2019t have real powers, but he is nevertheless very superstitious and continues to trust fortune-tellers. In this instance, once the fortune-teller tells him that the client is innocent of this crime, Saul immediately believes that his client is innocent. Does Saul now know that his client is innocent? Let\u2019s get a little clearer about what\u2019s going on and the key question here. Before Saul reviews the evidence, he clearly doesn\u2019t know that his client is innocent because he has no reason to think this and has very good reason to think that his client is guilty (after all, the guy committed the other three crimes, and Saul pretty much never de- fends innocent people\u2014he\u2019s unscrupulous, remember). Immediately after Saul reviews the evidence, it seems clear that he doesn\u2019t know that his client is innocent. He doesn\u2019t believe that his client is inno- cent, and knowledge requires belief (see The Quiz Show pp. 33\u201336 for a case that is designed to put pressure on this assumption). But, what about after he sees the fortune-teller? Now Saul believes that his client is innocent, the client actually is innocent of this crime, and KNOWLEDGE AND BASING 45 Saul has good reason for thinking he\u2019s innocent. What is more, Saul is not in the sort of situation that gives rise to the Gettier problem (see \u00adPromotions and Traveling Friends pp. 6\u201311 and A Strange County pp.\u00a016\u201320 for more on what these situations are like). Does Saul now know that his client is innocent? Importantly, if Saul does know that his client is innocent, then this case is a counterexample to the idea that the basing relation is a causal or counterfactual relation.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
