{"paragraph": " This entails that digital computers can achieve whatever humans can achieve by way of formal reasoning. Given this result, the question naturally arises of whether we should treat the computers as engaging in reasoning themselves. Are they merely sim- ulating the processes of thinking, or are they actually thinking? And how could we ever make this determination? The imitation game discussed in this chapter was proposed as a way to help us explore and answer this question. THE CASE Suppose you were given the following task: Communicate via sep- arate text message exchanges with two unknown subjects, one of whom is a computer and one of whom is a human being, and de- termine which is which. You can take the conversation in whatever direction you want and pose whatever questions you want\u2014whether 17 The Imitation Game 99 they be about the weather, mathematics, football, poetry, politics, ce- lebrity gossip, or something else entirely. Any topic is fair game. Carry out the conversation for enough time to get a good sense of each of the two subjects\u2014perhaps an hour. Now suppose that, at the end of the allotted time, you\u2019re unable to make the determination that you\u2019ve been charged to make. You really can\u2019t tell which subject is the computer and which subject is the human being. You take a guess that subject Alpha is the human being. But you\u2019re wrong; subject Alpha is the computer. We know that humans think. Given that subject Alpha has fooled you, a neutral interrogator, into identifying it as the human, should we conclude that it thinks? This basic set-up describes the imitation game, also known as the Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing in the early 1950s. Though we\u2019ve updated the description slightly\u2014Turing put it in terms of commu- nication by teletype and not by text messaging\u2014the key elements of the thought experiment remain the same. In Turing\u2019s view, the ques- tion \u201cCan a machine think?", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
