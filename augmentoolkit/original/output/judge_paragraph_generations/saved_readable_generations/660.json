{"paragraph": " Given the nature of each of the parts of the three wholes, the intrinsic badness of the first part is sufficient to make each of the three wholes intrinsically bad. Since, however, the second part of the second whole is good, whereas the second part of each of the other wholes is bad, the second whole, though bad, is not as bad as either of the other two wholes. The second part of the second whole, since it is intrinsically good, con\u00ad tributes to making the second whole not as bad as either of the other two wholes. Since, however, the negative intrinsic value of the first part of the second whole is greater than the positive intrinsic value of the second part of that whole, the intrinsic goodness of the second part, although it makes the whole intrinsically better than it would be if the second part were either bad or neither good nor bad, does not suffice to make the whole intrinsically good. It might be pointed out in passing that these considerations con\u00ad cerning the second whole apply also to retributive punishment. Suppose that someone, John, has done something bad, the doing of which makes him deserve to suffer punishment because he has done it. This gives rise to two possible wholes, each containing the same first part, which is John's doing the thing in question. In one of these possible wholes the second part is his suffering the punishment he deserves, whereas in the other the second part is his not suffering the punishment he deserves. Suppose that the second part of the first possible whole would be good, the second part of the second bad. Each of these possible wholes is such that it would be bad if it existed. The first would be bad because the negative value of the first part would be greater than the positive value of the second part, and the second would be bad because each of its parts would be bad. Since, however, each possible whole has the same first part, and since the second part of the first whole would be good whereas the second part of the second would be bad, the first whole, 46 The Nature of Value although it would be bad, would not be as bad as the second whole.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
