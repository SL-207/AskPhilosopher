{"paragraph": " Let\u2019s explain the possibilities in detail to help make the case clear. Beauty is put to sleep on Sunday. The researchers definitely wake her up on Monday. Later that evening, they flip the coin. If it comes up Sleeping Beauty 223 \u201cheads\u201d they won\u2019t wake Beauty up again on Tuesday. Instead, they\u2019ll just let her rest until the experiment ends on Wednesday. If the coin lands \u201ctails\u201d, the experimenters will briefly wake Beauty up on Tues- day and once again administer the drug that puts her to sleep and makes her forget waking up at all. A couple more things to keep in mind about this situation. Beauty is absolutely certain that the coin is a fair coin, and she is absolutely certain that it will be tossed fairly. And so, Beauty is absolutely certain that when this coin is tossed the objective chance of it coming up heads is \u00bd (the same is true for tails). She is also absolutely certain that the researchers will abide by the results of the coin toss and run the experiment as promised. Now things get interesting. When Beauty is awakened on Monday (before the experimenters tell her what day it is), what should she think about the results of the coin toss? In other words, what should she think about how likely it is that the coin lands heads or tails? What should Beauty think about the coin toss after the experimenters tell her that it is Monday? (What\u2019s going on here and why it\u2019s puzzling will become clearer as we look at responses to this puzzle.) RESPONSES There are three primary responses to the Sleeping Beauty problem, and they all have serious defenders. The positions are named in ac- cordance with the credence (roughly how much confidence) that they think Beauty should assign to the coin coming up heads. The positions are \u201cthirder\u201d (Elga 2000), \u201chalfer\u201d (Lewis 2001), and \u201cdouble halfer\u201d (Bostrom 2007, Meacham 2008, Pust 2012). Here\u2019s what they each claim. According to the thirder position, when Beauty first wakes up on Monday (before she knows what day it is) her credence that the coin lands heads should be 1/3 (this is why this is called the \u201cthirder\u201d position).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
