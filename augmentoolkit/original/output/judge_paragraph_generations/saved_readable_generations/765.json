{"paragraph": " This sense of the expression, however, is very loose indeed. In the case of a resolution to keep silent, what it seems to involve is treating something as doing something because something else has been done. 128 The Nature of Value I do something if I silently resolve to remain silent, and it is because I do something in doing this that my remaining silent is also regarded as doing something. What, however, I have resolved to do in silently re\u00ad solving to remain silent is not to inform John's wife that he is philan\u00ad dering. My remaining silent is my not informing her of his philan\u00ad dering. I remain silent, that is, by not doing something-by not informing her of his philandering. Similarly, if I remain silent because I believe it to be the right thing to do, my silence consists of my not doing something. To say that I believe that remaining silent is the right thing to do is to say that I believe that the right thing to do is not to inform her of his philandering. If so, then I do what I believe to be the right thing to do by not doing something-by not informing her of his philandering. If these considerations are acceptable, then my re\u00ad maining silent can be regarded as my doing something only in an ex\u00ad tremely loose and tenuous sense of \"doing something\". This sense of the expression, however, is so tenuous that doing something amounts to not doing something. It was maintained above that from the fact that remaining silent is sometimes justified it does not follow that so also is attempting to deceive. If so, then one can consistently contend that remaining silent is sometimes justified and that attempting to deceive is never justified. Since, however, the justification for remaining silent would seem to be the same as that for attempting to deceive, it is hard to see how the former but not the latter can sometimes be justified. In each case the jus\u00ad tification would be that the positive intrinsic value of the probable con\u00ad sequences of remaining silent and of attempting to deceive would be greater than that of the probable consequences of not remaining silent and of not attempting to deceive.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
