{"paragraph": " But the notion of physicality is vexed. This was not always so. Descartes defined the notion in terms of spa- tial extension. But most regard that definition as antiquated. Modern physics posits phenomena that are not extended in Descartes\u2019 sense (gravity might be an example). Today, physicalists often \u00adcharacterize the physical by deferring to science. Physical phenomena, they say, are the fundamental phenomena described by theories in \u00adphysics. But which theories? Current physical theories are incomplete, and future (or idealized) physical theories are unknown. That problem is dis- cussed in Chapter 21. And what if there are no fundamental \u00adphysical phenomena? A thought experiment illustrating that problem is \u00addiscussed in Chapter 22. DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-15 THE EXCLUSION PROBLEM BACKGROUND As soon as Descartes kicked off the modern discussion of the mind\u2013 body problem by arguing for substance dualism, he faced a crucial objection from his correspondent, Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia. Princess Elisabeth asks how an immaterial substance, like a soul, that lacks any extension in space can causally interact with a spatially ex- tended material substance like the body. Physical events sometimes cause mental events. For example, when my hand touches a flame, I feel pain as a result. Likewise, mental events sometimes cause \u00adphysical events. When my hand touches the flame, my pain causes me to jerk my hand back; and my pain\u2014along with my beliefs about how to ameliorate it\u2014causes me to hold my hand under a cold tap. \u00adMental\u2013 physical causal interaction seems commonplace. But, as Princess \u00adElisabeth points out, our conception of one thing causing another is closely tied to the way bodies are related in space. A pool cue moves the ball by being in contact with it. Explaining the ball\u2019s movement across the table, as it collides with other balls and caroms off the rails, is always a matter of explaining spatial contact between extended things.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
