{"paragraph": " In order to see this even more clearly, imagine that you and Fred, the flat earther, place a bet, the loser has to walk the other\u2019s dog. Fred bets that the Chicago Bears will win a particular football game, and you bet that they won\u2019t. Assume (unfortunately, for many years this has been a safe assumption!) that the Chicago Bears in fact lose the game. You come to collect on your bet, but Fred responds, \u201cI know that they won, so you have to walk my dog.\u201d Would you think that Fred knows that the Chicago Bears won even though they didn\u2019t? Or would you think that Fred doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about and needs to get to walking your dog? Presumably, you\u2019d conclude that Fred doesn\u2019t actually know that the Chicago Bears won regardless of how convinced he is that they did. Why not? Because it\u2019s not true. They didn\u2019t win, so Fred can\u2019t know that they did. Justification. We\u2019ve seen that knowledge requires true belief. Is that enough though? It seems not. Consider the following sort of situa- tion: you and your new friend (talking about the JTB theory has led you to move from acquaintances to friends) Fred, the flat earther, are discussing another football game that neither of you watched. Neither of you has heard the game\u2019s final score, and you both know that the odds going into the game were even, i.e. it was predicted that the teams were equally likely to win. However, Fred decides to believe that the Detroit Lions won. You ask Fred why he thinks they won, and he responds: \u201cNo reason, I just really want them to win, so I believe that they did.\u201d Let\u2019s assume that in fact Fred, by pure luck, is correct because the Detroit Lions really did win the game. Does Fred know that the Detroit Lions won before you and he look up the score? Surely not. Fred has no reason to think that the Detroit Lions rather than their opponents won\u2014he is simply believing because of wish- ful thinking.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
