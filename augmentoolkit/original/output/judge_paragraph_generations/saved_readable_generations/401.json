{"paragraph": " Discussions of skeptical scenarios and responses to skeptical argu- ments have been a central feature of epistemology for hundreds of years. This fact may give the false impression that most epistemologists are skeptics. Actually, most epistemologists think that the more famous forms of skepticism (such as skepticism about the world around us) are mistaken. Recognizing that most epistemologists are not skeptics, and yet epistemologists have spent (and continue to spend) a lot of time Limits of Knowledge 54 thinking about skepticism, prompts a question: Why? That is, why bother thinking about skeptical scenarios and skeptical arguments if almost no one actually accepts philosophical skepticism? There are a variety of reasons, two of which are worth mentioning here. One rea- son is that although almost no epistemologists are skeptics of this sort, some prominent epistemologists are. When well-informed experts sincerely hold a position, it is worth thinking carefully about it\u2014even if the position is very unpopular. Another reason is that by thinking carefully about skeptical scenarios and the arguments they support, we can come to better understand both the nature of knowledge (and related things like justification and understanding) and the limits of our knowledge. It is especially important to keep this latter reason in mind as we explore the entries in this section. We can better appre- ciate the thought experiments that are coming if we keep in mind that many are designed to help us think about what it really takes to have knowledge and to challenge our common assumptions about the extent of our knowledge. 11 DESCARTES\u2019 DEMON (CARTESIAN/EXTERNAL WORLD SKEPTICISM) Background: We commonly take ourselves to know a wide variety of things. Philosophical skeptics challenge whether we really have the knowledge that we think we have. It is important to keep in mind that generally skeptics do not claim that we fail to have knowledge because our beliefs are false.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
