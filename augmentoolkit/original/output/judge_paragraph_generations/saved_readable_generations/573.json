{"paragraph": " So, this seems to leave only denying either (a) the antirealist position that all truths are knowable or (b) the assumption that there are some truths that are not known by anyone. RESPONSES One response to the Knowability Paradox is to insist that it isn\u2019t a paradox at all but instead an argument that shows antirealist positions of this sort are false (Williamson 2000). This response contends that it is clear that there can be some truths that are unknown, so the Knowability Paradox simply shows us that it is false that all truths are knowable. Another response is to hang onto antirealism and simply accept that despite appearances to the contrary, all truths are in fact known. This may not be as troubling a consequence as it seems at first. After all, many people believe in God, and they believe that God is omniscient. One straightforward view of omniscience is that an omniscient being knows all truths. Hence, if one believes in an omniscient God, one is already committed to the idea that all truths are actually known. (It\u2019s worth noting that belief in God doesn\u2019t commit one to antirealism\u2014 the point here is simply that if one wants to save antirealism from the Knowability Paradox, the existence of an all-knowing God makes the seemingly problematic claim that all truths are known unproblematic.) Another response argues that the logic of knowability is paracon- sistent, i.e. there can be true contradictions in it (Priest 2009). Spe- cifically, this response contends that it can be true that someone both knows that p and at the same time doesn\u2019t know that p. The challenge for this sort of response is to motivate this move without trivializing the logic of knowability\u2014that is, making it so that one can\u2019t validly conclude anything on the basis of a purportedly true contradiction. A final sort of response involves restricting the antirealist idea that all truths are knowable in some sense.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
