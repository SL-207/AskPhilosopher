{"paragraph": " Social epistemology looks beyond just individual agents and their mental states to groups of people and how knowledge is shared among members of groups or even how groups themselves have (or lack) knowledge or justifica- tion. More specifically, social epistemology concerns issues related to testimony, disagreement, determining who is an expert on a topic, and epistemological questions concerning groups. It is important to note a mistake that may be tempting to make when first considering the idea of social epistemology. One might think that there\u2019s no need for social epistemology at all because one may believe that once we have settled the epistemological issues per- taining to individuals, there\u2019s no more work to be done. The gist of Social Epistemology 168 this line of thinking is that once we understand how individuals come to have knowledge or justification, all we have to do is apply this understanding to all of the members of the relevant group. Although this line of thought might seem plausible at first glance, reflection reveals that it is mistaken for a variety of reasons, two of which we\u2019ll highlight here. For one thing, individuals gain a significant amount (perhaps most!) of their knowledge from others via testimony. Conse- quently, we can\u2019t really understand the knowledge of individuals apart from the social epistemological issue of testimony. For another thing, as we\u2019ll see in discussing some entries to come, the epistemic statuses of various states of groups can diverge in important ways from the epistemic statuses of the relevant states of the individuals composing those groups. In light of this, we can\u2019t simply solve the epistemological problems of individual epistemology and thereby solve the problems of social epistemology. So let\u2019s take a look at some of the key issues and thought experiments to arise from the social epistemology literature. 33 THE UNBELIEVING TEACHER (TRANSMISSION VIEW OF TESTIMONY\u2014NECESSITY) Background: Testimony is a vital source of knowledge and justified beliefs.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
