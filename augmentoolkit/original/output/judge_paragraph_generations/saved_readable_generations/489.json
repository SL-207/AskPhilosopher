{"paragraph": " JUSTIFICATION 142 A different response also allows that this sort of case is possible; but rather than trying to present a way that proper functionalism can allow that Sal\u2019s belief is warranted, it involves arguing that we actually have good reason to think it isn\u2019t warranted (Boyce and Plantinga 2012). The general idea here is that given the way that Sal was created, in an important sense, Sal\u2019s belief is correct as a matter of luck. Hence, this response claims that Sal\u2019s belief really isn\u2019t warranted because he, unlike Al, is in a situation analogous to Gettier cases. A final sort of response seeks to attack the intuition that we rely upon in judging that Sal\u2019s belief is warranted (Boyce and Moon 2016). Roughly, this response insists that the reason that we tend to think that Sal\u2019s belief is warranted is that we are relying on an intuition that says that if two subjects hold the same belief and they came to hold it in the same way in relevantly similar environments, then if one is war- ranted so is the other. This response argues that although this intuition seems plausible, there are a number of examples that illustrate that it is false. Once it is shown that this intuition is false, we no longer have good reason to think that Sal\u2019s belief is warranted. RECOMMENDED READING GENERAL OVERVIEWS Proper Functionalism.
