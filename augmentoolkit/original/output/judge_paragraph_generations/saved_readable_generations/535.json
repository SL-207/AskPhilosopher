{"paragraph": " For instance, if a young child informs you that the moon is made of cheese, you shouldn\u2019t suddenly change your mind about the composition of the moon! You should simply disregard the disagreement with the child when it comes to your beliefs. Those disagreements are easy to adjudicate, but others aren\u2019t so easy. What should be done when you find yourself disagreeing with a peer\u2014someone who isn\u2019t superior or inferior to you epistemically? That is, what does it do to your justification for believing that p when you learn that an epistemic peer (someone who you justi- fiedly believe is just as likely to be correct about things like p as you are) disagrees with you about p? EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: DISAGREEMENT Asa and Pedro are out to dinner with a large group. After the meal, they decide that they will each calculate everyone\u2019s share of the tip. Asa and Pedro each justifiedly believe that they are equally good at math. They both look at the bill and round the total up to the same whole number. They both also agree that the tip should be 20%. After a few minutes, Asa concludes that everyone owes $20. Pedro con- cludes that everyone owes $22. Puzzled they double check if they both started with the same total for the bill; they did. They check that they both agree that the tip should be 20%; they do. And, they each as- sure one another that they\u2019re not kidding about what they think each person owes\u2014Asa sincerely believes each person owes $20 and Pedro sincerely believes that each person owes $22. So, they each discover that their friend, whom they take to be their epistemic peer about this DISAGREEMENT\u2014IN FAVOR OF EQUAL WEIGHT 193 sort of thing (they are each just as good at math, after all), disagrees with them. Clearly, someone has made a mistake; but who? When it comes to the epistemology of disagreement, the key issue is what should Asa and Pedro do with respect to their beliefs about what that everyone owes when they discover their disagreement.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
