{"paragraph": " On a functionalist view, mental states are defined in terms of their functional roles, and states that have different functional roles are thus classified as states of different types (see Chapters 15 and 16). A state\u2019s functional role is specified partly in terms of its cause, and so the functional role of a color experience will be specified partly in terms of the stimulation of the visual system (perhaps more specifically, the stimulation of the retina). For example, when Cyndi sees a red apple and has a red experience, her retina is stimulated. But Cyndi claims to have the same experience of red\u2014an experience that feels the same to her as the one she has when she sees a red apple\u2014when she hears bacon sizzling. In this case, there is a complete absence of the relevant stimulation of the visual system. As we noted earlier, Cyndi\u2019s eyes may even be closed. Thus, even though these two experiences of red are experientially the same, because they have different functional roles, functionalism cannot classify them as the same kind of experience. In response to these worries, various defenses of functionalism have been proposed. Some have argued that more sophisticated versions of functionalism can escape the challenge from synesthesia (Macpherson 2007), while others have argued that we should treat synesthetic experience as a malfunction, and thus not take it to shed any light on a given mental state\u2019s typical functional role (Gray 2001). Other philosophers have used related considerations to raise wor- ries about representationalist views of consciousness\u2014that is, the view that phenomenal character is nothing over and above representational content (see, e.g., Wager 1999, Rosenberg 2004; see Chapters 19 and 20). Here the problem seems to arise from the fact that mental states can be the same representationally without being the same phenom- enally. When a non-synesthete hears bacon sizzling and when Cyndi hears bacon sizzling, the thought goes, the experiences have the same representational content (of bacon sizzling), but Cyndi\u2019s experience has \u201cextra\u201d phenomenal content.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
