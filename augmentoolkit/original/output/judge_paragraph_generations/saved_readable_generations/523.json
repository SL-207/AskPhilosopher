{"paragraph": " George didn\u2019t ask the colleague because he was going to ask two of the team members no matter what. He asked the other colleague because he is a racist and thinks that Mar- tin, an African American man, can\u2019t possibly know the answers to his questions. Clearly, there are many things wrong with this situation. Most ob- viously is that George deserves moral criticism because he is a racist. Also obvious is that Martin has been wronged by George\u2019s actions. George has disregarded what Martin told him simply because Martin is African American. Everyone can agree that moral wrongs have oc- curred in this situation. However, in the contemporary epistemology literature, it has been noted that there is a specifically epistemic factor involved in this sort of case. In addition to other ways, it seems that Martin has been wronged as an epistemic agent. As a result of racial prejudice, Martin\u2019s capacity to engage in testimonial exchange has been impeded. Miranda Fricker, in her seminal discussion of epistemic injustice, argued that various prejudices, such as the racial prejudice in this case, generate what we might call \u201ccredibility deficits\u201d. Martin has a credibility deficit in this case because he is being treated as a far less credible testifier than he in fact is. The thought here is that such inappropriate credibility deficits produce a particularly epistemic kind of testimonial injustice. Although most everyone has agreed with Fricker that there can be epistemic injustice and that credibility deficits are one of them, much of the literature that followed Fric- ker has been focused on identifying additional sources of epistemic injustice. RESPONSES One response to this sort of case contends that it is not just credibility deficits that lead to this sort of testimonial injustice, but rather, there are also credibility excesses (Medina 2011, 2013). The thought is that in a given context, credibility isn\u2019t something that one person has in isolation.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
