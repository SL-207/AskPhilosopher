{"paragraph": " We can easily see that Belle and Bill formed their beliefs very dif- ferently. Belle had good evidence for her belief and Bill didn\u2019t for his. So when they each initially formed their beliefs, Belle\u2019s was justified and Bill\u2019s was unjustified. But what are we to say about Belle\u2019s and Bill\u2019s beliefs now when they each bring this belief to mind? Now they have both forgotten their evidence for their beliefs. Nevertheless, it seems intuitive that Belle\u2019s belief is still justified (what we should say about Bill\u2019s belief is a bit less clear). After all, there are many things that we know that we have forgotten our original evidence for believ- ing. Consider, you likely believe that George Washington was the first President of the United States; however, there\u2019s a very good chance that you don\u2019t remember learning this or the evidence you had for initially believing it. Nonetheless, you are justified (in fact, you know) FORGOTTEN EVIDENCE 131 that George Washington was the first President of the United States. Thus, it seems that at least some beliefs, such as yours about Washing- ton and Belle\u2019s about avocados, are justified, even though the initial evidence in support of them has been forgotten. But how can this fact be squared with evidentialism or internalism more generally? RESPONSES Some internalists attempt to respond to these sorts of cases by claiming that one\u2019s present mental states are not what matter for determining justification; instead, what matters is the evidence that one had when originally forming a belief (Huemer 1999). If the belief is justified when initially formed, then it will be justified later (assuming that one hasn\u2019t gained new evidence that undermines the belief). And, if the belief is unjustified when initially formed, it will be unjustified later (assuming that the person hasn\u2019t gained new evidence in support of the belief). This sort of response appears to yield intuitive results.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
