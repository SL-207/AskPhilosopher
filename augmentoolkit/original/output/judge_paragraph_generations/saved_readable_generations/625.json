{"paragraph": " Instead, the term \"fact\" has at least Ontological Categories and Bearers of Value 1 9 four distinct senses, according to which facts are either real entities, states of affairs that obtain, the obtaining or the non-obtaining of states of affairs, or true propositions. This, however, does not mean that there are no facts. If there are real entities, states of affairs that do or do not obtain, and true propositions, then there also are facts. Nor does the fact that facts do not constitute a distinct ontological category mean that the term ought no longer to be used. From the fact that neither of two alternative expressions indicates anything not indicated by the other it does not follow that either ought no longer to be used. 3 2. States of Affairs as Bearers of Value The preceding account of various species of objectives and of their rela\u00ad tionship to one another will suffice for our purposes. Its main purpose has been to prepare the ground for a consideration of the question of which, if any, of these species of objectives are bearers of value and which, if any, are not. Let us begin our treatment of this question by considering first the obtaining and the non-obtaining of states of affairs. The obtaining of any given state of affairs is either good, bad, or indifferent, and so also is the non-obtaining of any given state of affairs. That which determines the goodness, the badness, or the indifference of the obtaining or the non-obtaining of any given state of affairs would seem to be the nature of the state of affairs that does or does not obtain. Suppose that states of affairs a, b, and c obtain and that states of affairs x, y, and z do not. Suppose also that the obtaining of a and the non\u00ad obtaining of x are good, that the obtaining of b and the non-obtaining of y are bad, and that the obtaining of c and the non-obtaining of z are neither good nor bad. Since states of affairs a, b, c all obtain, and since the obtaining of a is good, that of b bad, and that of c indifferent, there must be some difference between a, b, and c by virtue of which the obtaining of a is good, that of b bad, and that of c indifferent.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
