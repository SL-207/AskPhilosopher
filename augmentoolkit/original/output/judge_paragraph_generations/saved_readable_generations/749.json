{"paragraph": " If the preceding is correct, there are at least three reasons for regarding the love of persons as one of the most central of the virtues and the hatred of persons as one of the most central of the vices. The first, as we saw above, is that such love disposes us to want those we love to be good, such hatred to want those we hate to be bad. The second, as we have just seen, is that such love disposes us to want those we love to have various goods, such hatred to want those we hate not to have various goods and even to have various positive evils befall them. The third reason, related to the first two, is that such love dis\u00ad poses us to employ rightly various other virtues we might have, such hatred to employ them wrongly. Various other virtues, such as courage, resoluteness, and perseverance, can be put to either a good or a bad use. Such virtues, considered in themselves in abstraction from the use to which they are put, are good-making properties of a person. Other Persons, Things, and Value 1 15 things being equal, a courageous person who is resolute in pursuing his goals and who perseveres when confronted with obstacles is more likely to achieve his ends than is a person who lacks these virtues. Thus a person who loves another and endeavors to contribute to the other's being good or to his having various goods is more likely, other things equal, to succeed in his endeavor if he has these virtues than if he does not. This applies also, however, to a person who hates another and endeavors to contribute to the other's being bad or to his not having certain goods or to his having certain positive evils befall him. Even though the possession of such virtues, taken in abstraction from the use to which they are put, be good in itself, it seems better, all things con\u00ad sidered, that a person not have them at all, or at least that he have them to a lesser degree, if he uses them mainly in the pursuit of bad ends.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
