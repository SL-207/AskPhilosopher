For example, if we know that a coin is fair and that it is fairly tossed, we are inclined to think that it is clear that one should think that it is 50% likely that the coin landed \u201cheads\u201d after the toss. There are situa- tions that put pressure on this seemingly obvious thought though. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: SLEEPING BEAUTY PROBLEM; SELF-LOCATING BELIEF Beauty has agreed to be a subject in a strange sleep experiment. Here\u2019s how the study is going to go. Beauty is going to be put to sleep on Sun- day. The researchers are going to briefly wake her up either only once or they will wake her twice over the three days of the study. They\u2019re go- ing to decide how many times to wake her by flipping a fair coin. If the coin lands \u201cheads\u201d, they\u2019ll wake her only once. If the coin lands \u201ctails\u201d, they\u2019ll wake her twice. When they put Beauty back to sleep, they\u2019ll do so with a drug that will make her forget that she woke up at all.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
