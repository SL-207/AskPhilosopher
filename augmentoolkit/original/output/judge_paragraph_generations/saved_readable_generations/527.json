{"paragraph": " The sort of ignorance where the person who has been/is being marginalized can\u2019t under- stand their own situation or express it to others. The second sort is where people in other social groups may remain ignorant of the situ- ation because those in marginalized groups aren\u2019t able to give expres- sion to the problem. For instance, Pam\u2019s coworker Jim, a member of the dominant male social group, doesn\u2019t harass Pam, and he would be apt to try to help Pam if he knew there was a problem. Nevertheless, given that the conceptual framework isn\u2019t in place for Pam to express her experiences or for others to realize that something is wrong, Jim is ignorant that Pam is suffering as a result of what she experiences at work. Another insight that has arisen is that there may be hermeneutical injustice even when a marginalized group does have the concepts and SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY 184 hermeneutical tools necessary to express their experiences. \u00adDominant social groups can perpetuate hermeneutical injustice by failing to accept the conceptual resources that marginalized groups have de- veloped to express their experiences (Dotson 2012). For instance, im- agine that Pam comes up with an idea about how to express what she is going through\u2014she calls her experiences \u201csexual harassment\u201d. Her coworkers can commit hermeneutical injustice by refusing to accept this concept. If they tell her there\u2019s no such thing, or they don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about, and so on, they are failing to accept the re- sources that she\u2019s developed for sharing her experiences in addition to ignoring what she is trying to tell them is clearly wrong. Relatedly, some have argued that there is an additional sort of hermeneutical injustice that is a kind of \u201cepistemic exploitation\u201d \u00ad(Berenstain 2016). The idea here is that dominant groups may wrongly pass the buck when it comes to understanding the situation of op- pressed groups.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
