{"paragraph": " On such a view it is such understanding that is intrinsi\u00ad cally good, not the having of true beliefs or pieces of knowledge. Al\u00ad though such understanding cannot be achieved unless one has various 122 The Nature of Value true beliefs and pieces of knowledge, it is only the having of such un\u00ad derstanding that can be intrinsically good, not the having of the various true beliefs and pieces of knowledge, which can be only extrinsically good as a means to or as contributing to the acquisition of such under\u00ad standing. If, however, we accept this view, the essential point I at\u00ad tempted to make above can still be made simply by changing slightly the language used to make it. Instead of saying that the having of true be\u00ad liefs and of knowledge can be and sometimes is intrinsically good, we need only say that understanding can be and sometimes is intrinsically good. It is not, however, the only intrinsic good, and the acquisition and possession by certain persons of certain forms of understanding might have certain consequences the existence of which would have far greater negative intrinsic value than the absence of such forms of understanding on the part of such persons would have. Thus if God does not in fact exist, a person who believes that He does exist does not understand that He does not. Yet if that person came to understand that God does not exist his entire life might be shattered irreparably into pieces and lose whatever meaning it had previously had for him. If so, then the conse\u00ad quences of his losing his belief would be far worse than those of his con\u00ad tinuing to hold it. And if this be so, then we who know such persons must take great care not to say or do those things that would cause them to lose their belief. 2. Theoretical and Practical Rationality The preceding points are consonant with, if indeed they do not follow from, a certain general view of the difference between theoretical and practical rationality and their relationship to one another.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
