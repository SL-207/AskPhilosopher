{"paragraph": " One of the important ways in which psychological phenomena differ from acts is that rightness and wrongness as well as moral goodness and badness are predicable of acts, whereas usually only moral good\u00ad ness and badness, not rightness and wrongness, except in a loose and perhaps metaphorical sense, are predicated of psychological phe\u00ad nomena. When, however, moral goodness and badness are predicated of acts, the predication is usually made of the motive animating the act, as distinct from the act itself, which is said to be simply right or wrong. In this connection, Ross makes a distinction between acts and actions, according to which acts are simply what I have been referring to as overt acts, taken in abstractiop. from the motives animating them, whereas actions are acts taken in conjunction with the motives ani\u00ad mating them. 6 Thus on Ross's terminology acts are simply right or wrong, not morally good or bad, whereas actions are morally good or bad. Since, however, acts taken in abstraction from their motives are not morally good or bad, it is the moral goodness or badness of the motive that determines that of the action. A question therefore arises as to what determines the moral goodness or badness of motives. It will not do to say that a given motive is morally good if it moves the agent to act rightly, morally bad if it moves him to act wrongly. A morally bad motive might move a person to act rightly, a morally good motive to act wrongly. A given person, John, for example, might rightly appoint Peter rather than Paul to a certain posi\u00ad tion that Peter rather than Paul because of his qualifications deserves to have, yet not because Peter deserves the appointment but instead solely because John is envious of Paul and because of his envy does not want Paul to have the position. If so, then although his act is right the motive animating it is morally bad. Or a person might perform a given act be\u00ad cause he believes it to be right when in fact it is wrong.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
