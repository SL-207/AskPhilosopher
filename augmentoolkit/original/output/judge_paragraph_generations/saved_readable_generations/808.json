{"paragraph": " Regardless of which alternative we choose, in such situations we shall either act rationally but wrongly or rightly but irrationally. Thus regardless of how in such situations we act we must either ( 1) sacrifice morality for the sake of rationality or (2) sacrifice rationality for the sake of morality. Those who value both morality and rationality will find such situations uncomfortable and will also doubtless desire some means of escaping them. If the argument presented above is sound, no such means is available as long as one continues to hold either ( 1) an egoistic view of rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality or (2) an egoistic view of morality and a non-egoistic view of rationality. Such a means, however, is readily provided by accepting either ( 1) an egoistic view both of rationality and of m\u00b7orality or (2) a non-egoistic view of both. One cannot, however, consistently accept both ( 1) and (2), which is to say that one cannot consistently accept both unmitigated egoism and unmitigated non\u00ad egoism. One or the other of these two positions might be acceptable, Morality and Rationality 161 but it is impossible that both be. The question therefore arises of which of the two we ought to adopt. This question cannot be answered satis\u00ad factorily simply by assuming that rationality requires us to accept unmitigated egoism. Such an answer would beg the question at issue by assuming that an egoistic view of rationality is the only acceptable view. We would be no more justified in making this assumption than we would be in assuming that the only acceptable view of rationality is some non-egoistic view. Nor is there any antecedent impartial concept of practical rationality that is neither egoistic nor non-egoistic to which we can make an appeal. If, however, we cannot assume either an egoistic or a non-egoistic view of rationality without begging the question at issue between unmitigated egoism and unmitigated non-egoism, and if there is no antecedent impartial concept of practical rationality that is neither ego\u00ad istic nor non-egoistic, then it might seem that the issue at stake between these two positions cannot be settled by showing that one is rational and the other irrational.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
