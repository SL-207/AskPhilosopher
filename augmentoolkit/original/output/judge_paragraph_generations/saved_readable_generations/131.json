{"paragraph": " But there are problems. One is that it is not entirely clear what is to count as a paradigmatically physical entity. Here it is worth not- ing that idealists, who maintain that everything is mental, would not agree that rocks and trees are physical if their being physical is meant to be inconsistent with their being composed of mental phenom- ena, such as ideas. Similarly, on this response, physicalism could be true even if rocks and trees turn out to involve some fundamental \u00admental features, as panpsychists claim\u2014and many take that result to be \u00adunacceptable. Further, it is not clear what the \u201crelevant respects\u201d are supposed to be (Montero 1999). Hempel\u2019s Dilemma 125 Another way to provide a substantive characterization of the phys- ical is to update Descartes\u2019 conception. Thus, Robert J. Howell (2013) proposes that a physical property is one that can be fully characterized in terms of its implications for the distribution of things in space over time. According to Howell, even if gravitational force is not ex- tended per se, it can be fully characterized in terms of its spatiotem- poral implications. Yet another approach to Hempel\u2019s dilemma is to identify features common to any physical theory, including ideal/completed physical theory. In particular, some argue that any physical theory will concern only spatiotemporal/causal structure and dynamics (Chalmers 2020). If so, then perhaps we can characterize the physical as the structural- and-dynamic, or perhaps as structural-and-dynamic phenomena and those composed of such phenomena. But the relevant notion of \u00adstructure and dynamics needs to be spelled out adequately, and it is controversial whether doing so is possible (Stoljar 2015, Alter 2016). On all of the foregoing responses the physical is characterized \u00adpositively\u2014that is, in terms of what it is to be physical. But some \u00adregard the search for an adequate positive characterization as \u00admisguided.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
