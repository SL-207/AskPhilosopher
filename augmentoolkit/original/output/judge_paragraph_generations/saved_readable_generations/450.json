{"paragraph": "\u201d The general idea here is that it\u2019s not enough that p explains the relevant facts better than each of the available rival explanations\u2014in order for it to be reasonable to believe that p, it has to also be true that p is in its own right a sufficiently good explanation of the facts. One way that this sort of restriction to sufficiently good explanations might be spelled out is to insist that p must have a minimum probability of being true in order to be inferred, which presumably \u201cLucky III won\u201d doesn\u2019t have for Bas in the above case (McCain and Poston 2019). Another way of spelling this idea out is that the best explanation is \u201cgood enough\u201d when we are justified in believing that this explanation is better than any other explanation that could be formulated (Dells\u00e9n forthcoming). The gist here is that in order to legitimately infer that p because p is the best explanation of some relevant set of facts, it has to be the case that it is reasonable for us to believe that any other explanations we might be able to come up with will be inferior to p. In the horserace case, it\u2019s plausible that we can come up with a better explanation, namely that some horse out of the group of the other 19 horses won the race.
