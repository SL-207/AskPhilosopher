Basic knowledge structure theories allow that one can have basic knowledge in the sense that a source can give one knowledge without one having to first know that that source is reliable. For example, a basic knowledge structure theory might say that perception is a basic source of knowledge. This would mean that one can gain knowledge from perception (one\u2019s senses\u2014vision, hearing, etc.) without first knowing that one\u2019s perceptual faculties are reliable. Or similarly, a basic knowledge structure theory might say that one can know things by relying on memory without first having to know that memory is reliable. The reasoning that motivates such theories is that it seems that we would be stuck with an infinite regress if we were to insist that one must first know that a faculty is reliable before we can gain knowledge from that faculty. After all, if this is true of all faculties, how would we possibly come to have knowledge that any of them are reliable? In order to avoid such a regress, and the skeptical consequences of it, many accept some version of a basic knowledge structure\u00a0theory.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
