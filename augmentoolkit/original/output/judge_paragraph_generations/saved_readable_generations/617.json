{"paragraph": " This applies to likings, dislikings, and valuings at each of the three levels distinguished above. Since, however, the goodness or badness of 12 The Nature of Value third-order phenomena depends on that of the second-order objects of such phenomena, that of second-order phenomena on that of the first\u00ad order objects of such phenomena, and that of first-order phenomena on that of the objects like, disliked, or valued at the first-order level, the goodness or badness of such objects is fundamental. Unless such ob\u00ad jects are themselves good or bad, no likings, dislikings, or valuings, re\u00ad gardless of the level at which they occur, can be either good or bad. If, that is, no such objects were themselves good or bad, all likings, dislik\u00ad ings, and valuings would be indifferent in value, and the widespread and persistent practice of evaluating objects would lose much if not indeed all of its point. 3. Terminological Remarks Liking something regardless of whether one regards the thing liked as good, valuing something in the broad sense of liking it without regarding it as good, and valuing something in the more restricted sense of regarding the thing valued as good regardless of whether one likes it, which I have called \"valuing proper,\" are all species of what are some\u00ad times termed \"pro-attitudes\". Similarly, disliking something regardless of whether one regards the thing disliked as bad, disvaluing something in the broad sense of disliking it without regarding it as bad, and dis\u00ad valuing something in the more restricted sense of regarding it as bad regardless of whether one dislikes it, which may be called \"disvaluing proper,\" are all species of what are sometimes termed \"con-attitudes\". One cannot take a pro- or a con-attitude toward a given thing without taking some specific pro- or con-attitude toward it, and to say of someone that he has a pro- or a con-attitude to a given thing, while informative, is not as informative as a specification of what species of pro- or con-attitude he has toward the thing in question.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
