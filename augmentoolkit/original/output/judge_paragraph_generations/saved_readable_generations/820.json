{"paragraph": " Just as others are persons the promotion of whose interests has value, so also I am a person the promotion of whose interests has value. Just as I would act wrongly by ignoring the interests of others, so also I would act wrongly by ignoring the pro\u00ad motion of my own interests. Thus just as practical rationality and morality require that I act compatibly with the promotion of the in\u00ad terests of others, so also they require that I act compatibly with the promotion of my own interests. Sometimes, of course, the promotion of the interests of others conflicts with the promotion of one's own in\u00ad terests. In such cases of conflict the interests of others sometimes have greater weight than mine have, and sometimes mine have greater weight. Sometimes it is hard to know which interests have greater weight-those of others or mine-and sometimes it might seem or indeed in fact be impossible to reach an impartial decision. Nonetheless, practical rationality and morality require that I seek, as 1 70 The Nature of Value far as possible, to promote my own interests only in those ways com\u00ad patible with the promotion of the interests of those affected by my action. For the unmitigated non-egoist the promotion of each person's rational self-interest consists precisely in acting in this way. Those who hold an egoistic view of practical rationality or of morality usually regard a person's interests as consisting in having var\u00ad ious goods such as health, bodily beauty, intelligence, wealth, power, and pleasant experiences. But, as was indicated in chapter 6, it is pos\u00ad sible that a person have various of these \u00b7goods without being a good person. Yet, as was also indicated there, most of us also have some con\u00ad cern about whether we are good persons, as is evidenced by the fact that we do not like to regard ourselves as or to acknowledge that we are bad persons. This indicates that most of us are concerned not only to have goods of various sorts but also to be good.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
