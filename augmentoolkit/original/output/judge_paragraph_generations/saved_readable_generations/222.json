{"paragraph": " For example, Casey O\u2019Callaghan (2011) denies that the difference in how a foreign language sounds to you before and after you learn it is best explained by saying that you hear the meanings of words (that is, by saying that your auditory con- tents represent semantic properties). A better explanation, he argues, is that, when you learn, you come to hear phonological (not semantic) features specific to that language (cf. Prinz 2006; but see Brogaard 2018). Other parts of Siegel\u2019s argument are also in dispute, and pos- itive arguments for the view that she opposes have been advanced (O\u2019Shaughnessy 2000, ch. 17). But both the Rich Content View and Siegel\u2019s argument for it remain influential; and, further, more empiri- cally based arguments for the Rich Content View (or something close to it) have also been developed (Block 2023). The Rich Content View relates to a host of philosophical issues (Siegel 2010, pp. 7\u201311). Some concern specific high-level properties. For example, consider the Humean claim that one can perceive the succession of events but not causal relations among events (see Chap- ter 31). Assuming causation is a high-level property, that Humean claim might lose some of its motivation if the Rich Content View is true. The Rich Content View also relates to general issues concerning mental representation, including, for example: why are any mental states about anything, and why do particular mental states have the representational contents they do (see Chapters 23 and 24)? The Rich Pine Trees and Cyrillic Text 215 Content View puts constraints on theories intended to answer those questions. If the Rich Content View is true, then the explanation had better allow for the fact that perceptual contents represent high-level features. According to Siegel (2010, pp. 11\u201313), the Rich Content view also relates to various issues in psychology and neuroscience. To mention one more related philosophical issue: can we draw a clean distinction, in the philosophy of science, between observation and theory?", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
