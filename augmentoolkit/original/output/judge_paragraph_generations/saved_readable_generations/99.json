{"paragraph": " Since, according to functionalism, two systems are in the same mental state if and only they are in the same functional state, and since you and Blockhead are in the same functional state without being in the same mental state, functionalism must be false. The argument has the same overall structure as the disembodied pain thought experiment that we considered in Chapter 3 and the zombie thought experiment that we considered in Chapter 7. Having imagined the Blockhead scenario, we use that to establish a claim about what is or is not possible, and then draw a conclusion about the falsity of a particular theory of mind. Since the debate here is basically The Blockhead 95 the same as the debate discussed in Chapter 7, we won\u2019t rehearse the worries that relate to this kind of argumentative structure. Instead, we will focus on worries that are specific to this thought experiment. One such worry that Block explores is that the Blockhead system would operate too slowly. Even if the mini-individuals are very fast at carrying out their very simple tasks, they would still operate much more slowly than the firing of a neuron. In Block\u2019s view, however, timescale shouldn\u2019t matter. Were your own mental operations to be slowed down, even considerably so, he claims that they would still count as the same mental operations. Another possible objection owes to the work of Sydney Shoemaker (1975, 1981), who worries about how cases of absent qualia would be detectable. In particular, he argues that the Blockhead thought \u00adexperiment suggests that each of us would be unable to tell if we are ourselves were lacking qualia. All we have in our own case is behavioral and introspective evidence. And, as Shoemaker puts it, if that\u2019s not ad- equate evidence, then nothing could be. But the Blockhead must have that same evidence about itself; if it had different evidence, then some kind of functional difference would be manifested\u2014you and the Block- head would not be functionally equivalent.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
