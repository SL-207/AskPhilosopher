{"paragraph": " The vast majority of epistemologists since Descartes have not opted for this response. Instead, most epistemologists have sought to find a flaw with the argument for skepticism yielded by this example. One contemporary response to this issue is to embrace a reliabilist form of externalism (see General Background: The Nature of Justification pp. 113\u2013119) (Greco 2008). The rough idea with this response is that you know things about the world around you so long as your beliefs are reliably produced (i.e. so long as the cognitive faculties that pro- duce those beliefs tend to produce more true beliefs than false beliefs). On this response, the fact that you don\u2019t have reasons for thinking that you aren\u2019t deceived by a demon doesn\u2019t matter. Similarly, if your belief that you aren\u2019t deceived by a demon is reliably produced (and true), it\u2019ll amount to knowledge as well. So, according to this reliabilist Limits of Knowledge 58 response, premise (2) of the skeptical argument is false because it doesn\u2019t matter whether you know that you aren\u2019t deceived by a de- mon. All that matters is that your true beliefs are reliably produced. It may also be that premise (1) is false, given reliabilism. As long as you believe that you aren\u2019t deceived by a demon, it\u2019s true that you aren\u2019t deceived by a demon, and your belief is reliably produced, reliabilism will say that you know that you\u2019re not deceived. Another externalist response is to accept a sensitivity account of knowledge of the sort discussed in earlier entries (see A Strange County pp. 16\u201320 and Red Barns and Blue Fa\u00e7ades pp. 21\u201324) (Nozick 1981) or the somewhat similar relevant alternatives account of knowledge (see Trip to the Zoo pp. 37\u201341) (Dretske 1970, Stine 1976). Both of these ac- counts of knowledge incorporate a denial of closure, which would mean that (2) of the argument above is false. On both of these responses, it can be true that you don\u2019t know that you aren\u2019t deceived by a demon, but also true that you know things about the world around you.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
