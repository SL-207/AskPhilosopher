{"paragraph": " If this is correct, then the most that those who believe that there is a significant moral difference between remaining silent and attempting to deceive can hope to establish is that any instance of the latter is intrinsically worse than any instance of the former. On such a view, both remaining silent and attempting to deceive can sometimes be justified, but more is required to justify the latter than is required to justify the former. Thus if the positive intrinsic value of the probable consequences of a given instance of remaining silent is the sam\u0417 as those of a given instance of attempting to deceive, it might suf\u00ad fice to justify remaining silent but not to justify attempting to deceive. Since, that is, any instance of attempting to deceive is intrinsically worse The Primacy of Practical Rationality 129 than any instance of remaining silent, anything that justifies the former justifies the latter, but something cari justify remaining silent without also justifying attempting to deceive. It seems, however, to be false that any instance of attempting to deceive is intrinsically worse than any instance of remaining silent. Whether a given instance of either is intrinsically worse than a given instance of the other depends upon the importance of whatever it is that one is remaining silent about or that one is attempting to deceive another into believing. If the negative intrinsic value of the probable consequences of remaining silent about something is much greater than that of those of attempting to deceive another, then remaining silent is intrinsically worse than attempting to deceive. To some it might seem that in such a case remaining silent would be only extrinsically, not intrinsically, worse than attempting to deceive. This would perhaps be true if the person who remains silent or who attempts to deceive neither knows nor could reasonably be expected to know either (a) what the probable consequences are of his remaining silent or attempting to deceive or (b) what the value of those consequences is if he does know or could reasonably be expected to know them.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
