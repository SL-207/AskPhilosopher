In contrast to the zombie argument, however, the Block- head thought experiment has a narrower target. Instead of focusing broadly on physicalism, it is directed specifically at functionalism. According to functionalism, mental states are to be identified with functional states. Functional states can be defined in terms of three things\u2014input, output, and relations to other states. So, for example, the functional state of foot pain can be defined in terms of the inputs that bring it about (stepping on a stray Lego brick or a nail, etc.), the outputs that it produces (crying out, clutching one\u2019s foot, etc.), and the relations in which it stands to other states (anger at whoever left the Lego or the nail on the floor, desire to avoid such objects in the future, etc.) This definition does not require any physical specification. On the functionalist view, we might think of a brain analogously to a complex computer, where what matters for mentality is the software, not the hardware. The functionalist analysis of mentality entails that if two systems are in the same functional state, they are in the same mental state. But 16 The Blockhead 93 many philosophers have thought that it\u2019s conceptually possible for there to be two systems in the same functional state that are different with respect to qualia\u2014that is, the experiential, \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d fea- tures of consciousness, such as the distinctive way it feels to see red or feel pain (see Chapters 4 and 5).", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
