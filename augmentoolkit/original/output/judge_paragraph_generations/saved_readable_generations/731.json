{"paragraph": " In addition, those persons who have a given virtue might well have it in various degrees. Some people are courageous and some are not, and among those who are courageous some are more courageous than others. Thus although we can know that a given glass window\u00ad pane is brittle even though it has not and might never manifest its brit\u00ad tleness, we cannot know that a given person is courageous if he has never, or only rarely, manifested courage. Another difference between the dispositional properties of persons and those of inanimate things, such as the brittleness of a glass windowpane, is that some such prop\u00ad erties might be possessed by a given inanimate thing constantly from the moment it comes into being until the moment it ceases to be, whereas a person who has a given virtue might later lose it and who does not have some other virtue might later acquire it. Given these differences between persons, we cannot know in advance which persons have which virtues, or the degree to which they have the virtues they have. We can know which persons have which virtues, and the degree to which they have the virtues they have, only through knowing how they act or feel in various situations. This applies to knowledge of one's own virtues as well as to knowledge of those of others. I can come to know which virtues I have, and the degree to which I have them, only through knowing how I act or feel in situations of certain sorts. This means that I cannot know whether I or another person has a given virtue if neither he nor I is ever in a situation of the sort in which the virtue in question can be manifested. If neither he nor I is ever in a situation in which courage can be manifested, then I cannot know whether either of us is courageous. I might have a well-grounded belief, based on my knowledge of other virtues I know that he and I possess- 102 The Nature of Value based, that is, on my knowledge of his character and of mine-that he or I would manifest courage if we were ever in a situation in which we could manifest it.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
