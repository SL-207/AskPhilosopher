In particular, it is widely taken to imply that consciousness supervenes on physical phenomena: any world that is exactly like the actual world in all physical respects (and contains nothing else) must be exactly like the actual world with respect to consciousness. That physicalist super- venience claim runs into a challenge from zombies: hypothetical crea- tures that are exactly like conscious human beings in all physical (and functional) respects, but that lack consciousness entirely. The zombie challenge was presented by Robert Kirk (see Kirk and Squires 1974, pp. 135\u201352) and popularized by David J. Chalmers (1996). THE CASE Here is how to imagine your zombie twin. Don\u2019t imagine a zombie from the movies, who is \u201cundead\u201d and likes to snack on human brains. Instead, imagine someone who is physically indistinguishable from you. Cell for cell, molecule for molecule, quark for quark, they are your counterpart. They also behave exactly as you do. At this moment, their eyes are positioned just as yours are, as you read these words.
