Importantly, evidentialism claims that S\u2019s justification with respect to any proposition supervenes upon the evidence that she has at that time. (When X supervenes upon Y that means that there cannot be differences in X without differences in Y.) So, according to evidentialism whether or not S is justified in believing that p at a particular time is determined by the evidence that S has at that time. Evidence that S once had but has now for- gotten makes no difference to what S is justified in believing now. Similarly, evidence that S doesn\u2019t have yet, but will come to possess, doesn\u2019t make a difference to what S is justified in believing now. Simply put, evidentialism says that evidence is all that matters when it comes to justification, and the only evidence that matters is the evidence one has right now.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
