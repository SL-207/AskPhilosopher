{"paragraph": " It\u2019s 99% likely that he stole the TV. The proof paradox becomes even more interesting when we con- sider slight variations of BUSES and TVs. Let\u2019s assume that in each case, there is actually an eyewitness who testifies about what happened. Let\u2019s further assume that the eyewitnesses aren\u2019t connected with Ginger or PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 250 Fred and don\u2019t seem to have any reason for giving false testimony. So, there\u2019s a neutral eyewitness who saw Ginger struck by a bus, and the witness says it was a blue bus. And there\u2019s a neutral eyewitness who says that Fred didn\u2019t pay for the TV, but instead he stole it. What should we think now? Most people think that now there are good grounds for awarding Ginger compensation in her lawsuit against the bus com- pany, and there are good grounds for convicting Fred of theft. What is puzzling about this is that we know that eyewitness testimony is far from perfect. In fact, it is very likely that the odds that someone stole a TV, say, given that an eyewitness reports this is less than 99% (and depending on the details, the eyewitness report is likely to fail to make it more than 85% probable that a particular color bus was involved in a hit-and-run accident). So, we are left with a puzzle. Why is it that the statistical evidence, which makes it 99% likely that Fred stole the TV, is insufficient for convicting him of a crime, but the evidence from an eyewitness, which fails to make it even 99% likely that Fred stole the TV, is good enough for a conviction? This is the proof paradox. As mentioned in the background above, beyond the applied epis- temological challenge that the proof paradox raises in legal contexts, there is a broader challenge here. Probabilism suggests that solely on the basis of the statistical evidence, we should believe that Fred stole the TV (and in many forms, it also suggests that we should believe that a blue bus struck Ginger).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
