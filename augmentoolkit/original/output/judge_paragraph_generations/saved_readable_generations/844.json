{"paragraph": " If it were, then two instances of the same kind would have the same or equal value, so that neither could have greater value than the other. Instead, the value of an instance of a kind, as an instance of that kind, is determined by the degree to which it has various of the good\u00ad making properties of the kind, and this can be discovered, not simply by knowing that it is an instance of the kind in question, but only by knowing also what the good-making properties of instances of that kind are and by discovering the degree to which the instance in question has these properties. Moreover, if the value of an instance of a kind were determined simply by the kind of which it is an instance, then no instance of a less valuable kind could have greater value than some instance of a more valuable kind. Yet if what was said above is correct, some instances of a less valuable kind can have greater value than some instances of a more valuable kind. Indeed, if what was said above is true, one kind can have greater value than another only because most of its instances have greater value than most of the instances of the other kind. In order, however, that an instance, a, of one kind have greater value than an instance, b, of another kind, it is not necessary, and indeed might not even be possible, that a have various of the good\u00ad making properties of instances of the latter kind to a greater degree than b does. A third consequence, connected with the first two, is that in order that a thing have value it is not always necessary that it have its value as an instance of some kind. Or if this be too strong a claim, let us say Attitudes toward the Indifferent 1 89 instead that in order that a thing be va,lued it is not necessary that it be valued as an instance of some kind. Instead, a person can value a thing even though he finds it most difficult _or even impossible to determine some kind of which it is an instance.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
