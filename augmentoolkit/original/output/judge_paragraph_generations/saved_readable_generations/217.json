{"paragraph": " In fact, it is both developmentally and conceptually antecedent to these related mental states/attitudes. More- over, aliefs are action-generating and affect-laden. In the Skywalk case, for example, we can explain the visitors\u2019 reluctance to step out onto the glass bridge in terms of their alief with the representational\u2013affective\u2013 behavioral content that includes \u201cthe visual appearance as of a cliff, the feeling of fear and the motor routine of retreat\u201d (Gendler 2008a, p. 641). In fact, Gendler thinks aliefs can be invoked to explain a whole host of other phenomena as well. Why does a soccer fan watching a replay of an earlier match yell at the players to pass, or to shoot, or to run faster? Why does a committed antiracism activist exhibit prefer- ences for Caucasian faces over Black faces when taking the Implicit-\u00ad Association test? Why does a movie-goer watching a horror film startle and shriek when the monster appears out of nowhere to claim a new victim? In all of these cases, Gendler thinks the behavior is best explained by attributing a certain alief to the relevant individual. Not everyone agrees that we need to invoke aliefs to explain the belief\u2013behavior mismatch in cases like the Skywalk. Eric \u00adMandelbaum (2013) has posed a dilemma to Gendler: either the content of an alief is propositional or it is associative. If the content is propositional\u2013of the sort \u201cthis is a dangerous situation,\u201d say\u2014then it\u2019s not clear why aliefs are really any different from beliefs. But if the content is \u00adassociative\u2014 of a sort that is not accessible for truth or falsity\u2014then it\u2019s not clear that aliefs can really play the explanatory role that Gendler needs them to play. (For a response to Mandelbaum\u2019s worry, see Dan\u00f3n 2021.) PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 210 A related criticism has been raised by Greg Currie and Anna Ich- ino (2012), who argue that the kinds of cases that prompt Gendler to postulate the novel category of alief can all be accounted for in terms of mental-state types that we already countenance.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
