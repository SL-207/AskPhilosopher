{"paragraph": " More precisely, phenomenal conservatism says that if it clearly and firmly seems to S that p, then (assuming that S doesn\u2019t have undefeated defeaters) S is justified in believing that p. A couple questions need to be answered so that we can firmly grasp what phenomenal conservatism is saying. The first question is: what is a seeming? While there is disagreement on this point, most agree (in fact just about every supporter of phenomenal conservatism thinks this) that seemings are a kind of experience. Seemings are expe- riences with three distinctive features. First, seemings have propositional content. This means that they represent the world as being a particular way. It is this feature that accounts for why seemings are always seemings that something is the case. Second, seemings can be accurate/inaccurate. Since seemings represent the world as being a particular way, they are accurate when the world really is that way and inaccurate when the world isn\u2019t that way. Third, seemings have a particular phenomenology. They have what is sometimes called \u201cphenomenal force\u201d. They present their content in a way JUSTIFICATION 154 that makes the content feel true. For example, think about imagining that there is a tree in the yard versus actually seeing that there is a tree in the yard. In both cases, the experience (the imagining and the visual experience) has propositional content\u2014namely that there is a tree in the yard. However, only your visual experience has phenomenal force. The visual experience presents its content in a way that the content feels true, but the imagining doesn\u2019t. With the concept of seemings in hand, let\u2019s turn to the second question: what is an undefeated defeater? A defeater is something that takes away justification. Commonly, two kinds are distinguished: rebutting defeat- ers and undercutting defeaters. Let\u2019s think of an example. Imagine that someone you trust tells you that p.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
