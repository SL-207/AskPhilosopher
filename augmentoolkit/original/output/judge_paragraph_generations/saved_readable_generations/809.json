{"paragraph": " Such a, conclusion, however, would be reached too quickly and would seem to assume that there is no other way in which one of the contending positions can be shown to be rational and the other irrational. There is, I shall seek to show, another way. It con\u00ad sists essentially in reversing the order assumed by many who have raised and endeavored to answer the question, \"Is it rational to be moral?\" Instead of attempting to show that practical rationality requires that we accept either ( 1) an egoistic moral position or (2) a non-egoistic moral position, the procedure to be employed is to endeavor to show that morality requires that we accept either ( 1) an egoistic view of practical rationality or (2) a non-egoistic view of such rationality. Instead, that is, of antecedently assuming either an egoistic or a non-egoistic view of practical rationality and tailoring our view of morality to fit the view of rationality we antecedently assume, the procedure we ought instead to follow is to tailor our view of practical rationality to fit the view of morality we adopt. Since, however, the issue at stake is that of whether we ought to accept an egoistic or a non-egoistic view of morality, we cannot begin by assuming without argument that one of these views is acceptable and the other unacceptable. Such a procedure would amount to begging the question against the position we antecedently reject in advance of any argument. What we must instead endeavor to do is to give non-question-begging arguments for accepting one of these views of morality and rejecting the other. 162 The Nature of Value If by means of moral argument we can establish that some kind of egoistic morality is morally preferable to any kind of non-egoistic morality, we can thereby show that an egoistic view of practical ratio\u00ad nality is preferable to a non-egoistic view. But if by means of moral argument we can establish that some sort of non-egoistic morality is morally preferable to any sort of egoistic morality, we can thereby show that a non-egoistic view of practical rationality is preferable to an ego\u00ad istic view.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
