{"paragraph": " Using the words \u201cchariot\u201d or \u201cNagasena\u201d is a helpful way to designate those parts, but we shouldn\u2019t be misled into believing that there is something behind those phenomena that the words refer to. This no-self view raises important questions about a person\u2019s endur- ance over time. This question is particularly pressing for the Buddhists who believe in reincarnation. Reincarnation seems to consist in one person\u2019s dying and then being reborn in another body. For the Bud- dhists, this has an ethical dimension\u2014one\u2019s actions generate karma that determines the quality of rebirth, and one strives to reach the perfected state of the Buddha, who will not be reborn. How can there be one person who dies and is then reborn, whose karma determines The Chariot and the Candle 249 the nature of their later incarnation, if there is no self in the first place? Even if we\u2019re not concerned with reincarnation or karma, we might wonder whether an adult is the same person they were as a child or that they will be in later years. According to Nagasena, the adult is not the same person as the child; but nor are they someone else\u2014since there is no person there in the first place. Despite this, Nagasena ad- mits that there is a sense in which the adult is the same as the child. If there weren\u2019t, he says, there could be no mothers, since a mother has to have given birth to a child. If there were no sense in which some- one endures through time, no person has ever given birth to anyone! Again, Nagasena appeals to an analogy. It is possible to light a lamp and have it shine all night. Is the flame at midnight the same as the flame at dusk? In a sense it certainly is\u2014the flame never went out. On the other hand, there is no thing that is the flame, shining from hour to hour. The flame at a time is just a set of molecules vaporizing and oxidizing, and new molecules (from the fuel) continually replace the old ones.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
