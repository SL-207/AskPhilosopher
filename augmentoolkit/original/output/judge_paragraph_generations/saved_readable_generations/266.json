{"paragraph": " All of these actually occurring conditions allow us to explore what happens when psychological continuity and physical continuity diverge. That said, many other philosophers continue to find the body-swap cases to be compelling, and they defend their reliance of thought ex- periments like these against Williams\u2019 criticisms. Many such defenses attempt to point out disanalogies between Case 1 and Case 2. For example, one disanalogy arises from the fact that Case 1, but not Case 2, is described in the third person\u2014a disanalogy that Williams himself explicitly acknowledges. According to this line of response, the fact that Case 2 has been made personal twists our intuitions, and thereby corrupts our ability to trust our judgments. Another disanalogy arises from the fact that in Case 1, but not in Case 2, one\u2019s memories end up in another body. In Case 2 the fact that one\u2019s memories disappear entirely means that there is no alterna- tive person with which one can identify, and so that makes one more inclined to identify with the memory-less body. One way to put this point is that we are often inclined to identify ourselves with the indi- vidual who is our \u201cclosest continuer,\u201d and whether a given individual counts as one\u2019s closest continuer depends on what other continuers are around (see Nozick 1981). The significance of the first of these disanalogies was explored via some empirical studies conducted by Shaun Nichols and Michael Bruno (2010). Drawing on earlier work by Blok et al. (2005), Nichols PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 258 and Bruno tested whether people\u2019s intuitions about Case 2 changed when it was described in a second-person way (along the lines of \u201cYou will be tortured \u2026\u201d) vs. a third-person way (\u201cJerry, the \u00adkidnapped person, will be tortured \u2026\u201d). They found no statistically significant dif- ference between these two cases\u2014people responded in the same way whichever way Case 2 was described.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
