{"paragraph": " If, that is, the appropriate attitude to take toward such a thing is one of indifference, then liking or disliking it would be inappropriate and therefore bad. A second possible extreme answer to our question is that an attitude of indifference toward an indifferent thing is itself indifferent, liking or disliking it both bad. Although liking or disliking an indifferent thing are both bad, being indifferent toward it can be neither good nor bad but instead must itself be indifferent. This answer, however, does not have much plausibility and would seem to rest on the assumption that if a thing is indifferent indifference toward it is also indifferent. From the fact, however, that something is indifferent it does not follow that indifference toward it must also be indifferent. If, then, we had to choose between the first and second answers, the first would seem to be preferable. It would seem, that is, to be more plausible, at least initially, to hold that a thing's being indifferent makes an attitude of indifference toward it good rather than indifferent. A third possible extreme answer is that an attitude of indifference toward an indifferent thing, rather than being good or indifferent, is instead bad. There would, however, seem to be little, if anything, to rec\u00ad ommend such a view. The view that an attitude of indifference toward an indifferent thing is good, given that the thing toward which one is indifferent is itself indifferent, does have at least some initial plausi\u00ad bility. But the view that such an attitude would be bad seems to have no plausibility whatever. If such an attitude would be bad, then, given that 178 The Nature of Value there are only three possible attitudes one can take toward an indif\u00ad ferent thing-one of liking, one of disliking, or one of indifference-any attitude one could take toward an indifferent thing would be bad unless either liking or disliking it were either good or indifferent.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
