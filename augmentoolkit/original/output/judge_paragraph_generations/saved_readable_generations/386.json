{"paragraph": " And, if they were good at it, the mule would look just like a zebra from this distance.\u201d Ebony, starting to get a bit tired of this line of questioning, responds \u201cWhy on earth would someone paint a mule to look like a zebra and put it in the zebra pen at the zoo?\u201d Andrew thinks for a few moments, and then he says: There could be a reason. Maybe the zebras are sick, and the zookeepers know that people want to see zebras when they come to the zoo. So, rather than risk upsetting visitors they decided to paint some mules to look like zebras. After this, Andrew and Ebony gaze at the animal for a few minutes in silence. Andrew breaks the silence, \u201ccan you really be sure that that\u2019s a zebra rather than a cleverly disguised mule?\u201d After rolling her eyes, Ebony says, \u201clet\u2019s go see the lions.\u201d This sort of case is interesting because it seems that accepting that knowledge is closed under known entailment (or simply \u201cclosure\u201d) may commit us to something strange. Let\u2019s get clear on what closure commits us to here. Ebony and Andrew (and we) know that the an- imal\u2019s being a zebra logically entails that it\u2019s not a cleverly disguised mule. So, if it\u2019s a zebra, it\u2019s not a mule; and if it\u2019s a mule, it\u2019s not a zebra. So far so good. However, now things may seem to get a little strange. If Ebony knows that the animal is a zebra, then it seems that (via closure) she is in a position to know that it is not a cleverly disguised mule. But, how could she know that? After all, Andrew is correct that if the mule were painted in a careful way to look like a zebra, neither he nor Ebony would be able to tell the difference between the mule and a real zebra. This makes it seem that Ebony can\u2019t know that the animal is not a cleverly disguised mule. However, if Ebony can\u2019t know that the animal isn\u2019t a cleverly disguised mule, then by closure she doesn\u2019t know that the animal is a zebra. But, this doesn\u2019t seem right either.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
