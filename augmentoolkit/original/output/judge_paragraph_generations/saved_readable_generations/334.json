{"paragraph": " Basic particles, for example, are described in terms of their propensity to interact with other particles. Mass is described in terms of a propensity to be accelerated by certain forces. Substance dualism\u2003 The theory that the mind and the body are fundamentally distinct substances, where substances are things rather than properties of things. The best-known version of sub- stance dualism is the version developed by Descartes, known as Cartesian dualism. According to Descartes, a substance is some- thing that exists independently of other things. So, according to Cartesian dualism, the mind and the body are things that can exist independently of each other. See also dualism, property dualism. Supervenience\u2003 Supervenience is a relation of dependency. If A supervenes on B, then A cannot vary without B varying. For \u00adexample, suppose a statue supervenes on the clay out of which Glossary 323 it is composed. In that case, there can be no change in the statue without a change in the clay. Physicalism is usually thought to entail that the mental supervenes on the physical: there cannot be any variation in a mental state without variation in the physical state in which the mental state consists. Transitivity\u2003 A relation R is transitive if and only if the following is true: If x stands in relation R to y, and y stands in relation R to z, then x stands in relation R to z. For example, identity is transitive: if x = y and y = z, then x = z. Types and tokens\u2003 Types are kinds of things, and tokens are indi- vidual things. For example, consider the word \u201cbook.\u201d How many letters does that word contain? If you count by letter types, then the answer is three. If you count by letter tokens, then the answer is four. Philosophers of mind often apply this distinction to men- tal states. For example, they distinguish pain as a type of mental state from token pains. Andy\u2019s headache and Barbara\u2019s headache are states of the same type, but their token headaches are distinct from each other.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
