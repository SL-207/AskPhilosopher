{"paragraph": " This sort of case was originally presented independently by Rich- ard Fumerton and Bas Van Fraassen to show that, contrary to what we might have thought and to our ordinary reasoning practices, IBE is not a legitimate way to reason. Hence, the cases where science has relied upon instances of IBE and achieved great success were either just matters of luck or else really some other method of reasoning was being used and the causes of the achievements have simply been misdescribed. RESPONSES One way of responding to this problem is to insist that one can be justified in believing a proposition even if that proposition isn\u2019t likely to be true (Smith 2016). Thus, one might argue that contrary to our initial intuition in this case, Bas really should believe that Lucky III won even though it\u2019s likely that he is mistaken. On this response, IBE doesn\u2019t have a problem even if it licenses inferring things that aren\u2019t likely to be true because believing such things can still be justified. By far, the most common, non-skeptical response to this problem though doesn\u2019t require denying that one can be justified in believing a proposition only if the proposition is likely to be true. Rather, the LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 102 most common sort of response involves restricting IBE in an important way (Musgrave 1988, Lipton 2004, McCain 2016). As we described it above (and as it is often described in ordinary life\u2014and sometimes in the philosophical literature), IBE says that we can infer that p when p explains the relevant facts in a way that makes p a better explanation of those facts than the available rival explanations. If we construe IBE in this way though, it leads to the problem depicted in the horserace example. However, several philosophers have argued that the way to block this sort of problem is to recognize that IBE needs to be re- stricted to cases where the best explanation is \u201cgood enough.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
