{"paragraph": " They both therefore escape the difficulty confronting those, whether they be rationalists or moralists, who hold an egoistic view of rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality (and also any who might hold an egoistic view of morality and a non-egoistic view of rationality). This difficulty, it will be recalled, is that what an egoistic ( or a non\u00ad egoistic) view of rationality requires of us sometimes conflicts with what a non-egoistic (or egoistic) view of morality requires, so that at times it is impossible to act both rationally and morally. No such con\u00ad flicts, however, can occur if what practical rationality requires of us is identical with what morality requires of us. At least a partial recognitio:q that this is so has perhaps been at least one of the considerations moving rationalists who hold an egoistic view of rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality to endeavor to show that it is rational to be moral or to act morally by attempting to estab\u00ad lish that it is in our long-term interests so to be or to act. On such a view, acting in accordance with the requirements of non-egoistic morality is regarded as a means to an end consisting of the promotion of one's long-term interests. The difficulty, however, is that although such action might generally or usually be a means to the attainment of such an end, it is not always, and there are times when such an end can best be attained only by rejecting such a means. This the unmitigated egoist recognizes. He therefore recommends that we comply with the require\u00ad ments of non-egoistic morality when it is in our interests to do so and that we ignore or violate these requirements when it is in our interests not to comply with them. Sometimes it might be in our long-term inter\u00ad ests to deceive others into believing that we are complying with such requirements when in fact we are not, and sometimes it might not be.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
