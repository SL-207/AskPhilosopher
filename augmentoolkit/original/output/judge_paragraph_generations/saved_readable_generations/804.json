{"paragraph": " Unlike, however, the rationalist and the moderate moralist, the extreme moralist recognizes that at times the requirements of an egoistic view of rationality conflict with those of a non-egoistic view of morality in such a way that it is impos\u00ad sible that both sets of requirements be satisfied. This, however, presents no serious problem for the extreme moralist, since he unequivocally maintains that in such cases of conflict the satisfaction of the require\u00ad ments of an acceptable non-egoistic morality always takes precedence over the satisfaction of the requirements of egoistic rationality. For him it is more important to act rightly and to be moral than it is to be rational, so that if at times it is not rational to act rightly or to be moral 15 8 The Nature of Value we ought always to sacrifice acting rationally for the sake of acting rightly and being moral. Thus for the extreme moralist the existence of conflicts between the claims of rationality and those of morality does not even present a serious problem, much less an insuperable difficulty. The rationalist, the moderate moralist, and the extreme moralist all hold an egoistic view of rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality. Another possible position, mentioned above, takes a non-egoistic view of rationality and an egoistic view of morality. Although this is a pos\u00ad sible position, I do not know of anyone who has held it. All the same, it might be worthwhile to compare it with the first three positions. Whereas each of the first three positions holds that practical rationality consists in acting compatibly with the promotion of one's own long\u00ad term interests, the fourth position holds that it is morality, not ratio\u00ad nality, that requires that we act in this way. And whereas each of the first three positions holds that morality requires, at least in certain situ\u00ad ations, that we seek as an end something other than the promotion of our long-term interests, the fourth position holds that it is rationality, not morality, that requires this of us.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
