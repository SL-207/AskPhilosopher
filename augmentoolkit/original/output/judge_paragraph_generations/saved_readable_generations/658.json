{"paragraph": " From this, however, it does not follow either ( 1) that a has no instrumental value at all or (2) that any instrumental value it has must be negative if the instrumental value of b is positive or positive if the instrumental value of b is negative. Although the existence of y would have greater positive intrinsic value than the existence of x has, the existence of a would still have positive instrumental value as a means to the existence of x, provided that x has positive intrinsic value. The intrinsic goodness of x suffices to make a instrumentally good if a is a means to x. Any\u00ad thing that has value, whether the value be intrinsic, instrumental, or 44 The Nature of Value contributory, has the value it has regardless of whether it can be replaced by something else that has greater intrinsic, instrumental, or contributory value. It was maintained above that perhaps the most obvious kind of whole that has parts consists of material things. Such things, however, are not the only wholes that have parts. There are many kinds of things, events, acts, and states of affairs that are such that two or more of them con\u00ad stitute a whole of which each is a part. Thus suppose that three men, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob exist. Suppose also that in some way each has unjustifiably caused his parents to suffer; each, that is, in some way has inflicted unmerited suffering on his parents. Suppose further that each later thinks of the suffering he has caused his parents. Suppose, finally, that Abraham is pleased that he caused his parents to suffer, that Isaac is sorry that he has done so, and that Jacob is indifferent about his having done so, being neither pleased nor sorry. Given the preceding, we can distinguish between three wholes, each with two parts. The first consists (1) of Abraham's causing his parents to suffer and (2) of his being pleased that he has done so; the second consists ( 1) of Isaac's causing his parents to suffer and (2) of his being sorry that he has done so; the third consists (1) of Jacob's causing his parents to suffer and (2) of his being neither pleased nor sorry that he has done so.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
