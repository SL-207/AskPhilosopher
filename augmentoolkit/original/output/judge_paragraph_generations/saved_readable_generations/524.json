{"paragraph": " Instead, one\u2019s credibility in a given context is determined by comparisons between that person and others. Hence, Martin is wrongly given a credibility deficit in part because George affords Martin\u2019s colleagues a credibility excess. Some have argued that the SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY 180 way to remedy situations like the one described in the case above is by way of large-scale structural changes. The idea is that in order to correct for the sort of prejudice that leads to this sort of epistemic in- justice, it is necessary to change the way various institutions function when it comes to the sharing of information. A further insight that consideration of this sort of case has yielded is the recognition that there may be different kinds of testimonial in- justice (Dotson 2011). The first kind is the sort that earlier responses discussed, what might be called \u201ctestimonial quieting\u201d. This is what happens to Martin when George fails to treat him as knowledgeable, and so doesn\u2019t accept his testimony. A different sort of testimonial injustice would occur if Martin, realizing that George wouldn\u2019t be open to accepting him as knowledgeable, were to change what he says so that it is limited to things that George would be likely to believe given that Martin is the speaker. This latter sort of testimonial injus- tice has been called \u201ctestimonial smothering\u201d. It is where a speaker, like Martin, is pressured to limit their testimony because they will be ignored otherwise. RECOMMENDED READING GENERAL OVERVIEWS Feminist Social Epistemology.
