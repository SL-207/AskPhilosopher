{"paragraph": " So, what should she do? How should she decide? The durian case is fairly low stakes. But now consider a much \u00adhigher-stakes case. When she returns from Malaysia, Blythe finds her- self thinking a lot about parenthood. Though she is currently childless, her biological clock is ticking, and she realizes she needs to decide whether or not to have a biological child. She\u2019s done some babysitting before, but she\u2019s been told that watching someone else\u2019s child for a short period of time is really nothing like being a parent. She has read The Puzzle of Transformative Choice 309 various parenting guides and books about the experience, but those seem to fall short of teaching her what it would be like to be a parent. She has also talked about parenthood with friends and siblings who have kids, but this also falls short, in part because the different reports conflict in various ways with one another. Although most of those people are wildly enthusiastic about the experience, they also have various complaints, and a few seem to have some regrets about their decision to have kids. In all cases, however, it\u2019s clear that the individu- als\u2019 lives have been dramatically changed as a result of becoming par- ents. They also find themselves having radically different preferences from the ones they had before. For example, some who were die-hard night owls have now happily become early risers. Most all of them have given up old hobbies and taken up new ones. As Blythe tries to make her decision, she finds that she really doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019d be getting into\u2014just like in the durian case, although now with a lot more on the line. So, what should she do? How should she decide? Whether to become a parent is just one of many big life decisions that present this problem. Edna Ullmann-Margalit (2006, p. 160) sug- gests many other examples, such as decisions about whether to get married, whether to migrate to a new country, what career path to choose, or whether to quit one\u2019s job to explore a longtime passion.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
