Finally, consider a thought experiment developed by Charles Mills (1998) involving a man he calls Mr. Oreo. (While Mills himself uses the case to probe questions about the metaphysics of race, it also works nicely to probe questions about narrative identity.) Mr. Oreo is dark-skinned, has distinctively African features, and has known Af- rican ancestry. But he is unhappy being considered black. Thus, when he is asked to provide demographic information about himself, he checks the box for \u201cwhite\u201d rather than for \u201cblack\u201d; he thinks of him- self as white, and he shies away from customs, music, and food that are typically associated with black culture. Even so, he has trouble getting other people to accept his own self-characterization. To address this, Mr. Oreo invents a machine that can completely transform his skin, hair, and facial features so that he will present as white. Because his invention was inspired by a similar device described in the book Black No More by George Schuyler, he calls it the Schuyler machine. Af- ter undergoing his cosmetic transformation, his physical appearance is more in line with his sense of himself, and he begins to be treated by others as white. What should we say about the constitution of his identity? PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 304 DISCUSSION Many of the philosophers who offer narrative views in response to the characterization question have taken the relevant narratives to be first-personal in nature (Schechtman 1996, Lindemann 2001, DeGra- zia 2005). Call this the self-narrative view. The decision to focus on first-person narratives rather than third-person narratives can be mo- tivated by the sense that individuals are typically authoritative about their own identities. On the self-narrative view, individuals engage in an active process of construction and unification when constituting their narrative.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
