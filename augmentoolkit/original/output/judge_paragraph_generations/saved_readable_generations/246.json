One important discussion takes place in The Questions of King Milinda (The Milinda Pa\u00f1ha), a Buddhist text that is thought to have been written between 100 bce and 200 ce. In a conversation between King Milinda and a monk named Nagasena, this text presents an argu- ment that there is really no such thing as the self. In connection with this no-self view, however, the text also explores questions relating to a person\u2019s endurance through time. This exploration, centered on thought experiments involving chariots and candles, is discussed in Chapter 40. The remaining chapters in Part V take up related themes. The thought experiments discussed in Chapters 41\u201343 raise various chal- lenges to Locke\u2019s memory theory. Some of these challenges might be met by broadening from a theory about continuity of memory to a theory about continuity of psychology. But other challenges run deeper, and many philosophers have suggested that we would do bet- ter to abandon psychologically based theories of personal identity and instead adopt physical theories. We explore some of the considerations in favor of a physical theory in Chapter 41 by returning to a pair of thought experiments involving body-swaps. In Chapter 42, we ex- plore related issues by considering a thought experiment in which a person\u2019s mind is uploaded to a computer. In Chapter 43, we consider a thought experiment about a statue and the clay out of which it is made in an effort to better understand the relationship between per- sons and bodies. Chapter 44 explores the phenomenon of split brains, a real-life condition that results from a surgical procedure in which the brain\u2019s two hemispheres are disconnected from one another. As this chap- ter discusses, this puzzle case has important ramifications for personal identity and the unity of consciousness. We continue exploration of the unity of consciousness in Chapter 45, which explores a thought PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 239 experiment that suggests that thoughts and minds might be shared by more than one person.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
