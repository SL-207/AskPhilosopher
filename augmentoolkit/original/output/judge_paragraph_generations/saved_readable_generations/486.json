{"paragraph": "e. it encompasses both jus- tification and the condition required to solve the Gettier Problem), versions of proper functionalism have been generated for various epistemic goods such as justification, epistemic probability, and so on. Here we will focus on the \u201cwarrant\u201d formulation because it is central to proper functionalism and because it is close enough to justification to fit with this section of the book. According to proper functionalism, S\u2019s belief that p is warranted when and only when: (1) S\u2019s belief that p is produced by a properly functioning cognitive faculty, (2) the cognitive faculty that produces S\u2019s belief is aimed at truth, (3) S forms the belief that p in the sort of environment for which the relevant cognitive faculty was designed, and (4) the design plan of the cognitive faculty is reliable (in the appropriate environment, it is highly probable that beliefs formed by the proper functioning of that cognitive fac- ulty are true). A key question about proper functionalism is: what exactly is a \u201cdesign plan\u201d? One prominent way of understanding proper func- tionalism takes the idea of a design plan literally\u2014God is the creator and JUSTIFICATION 140 designer of one\u2019s cognitive faculties. God designed one\u2019s cognitive faculties to function properly in certain environments. The other prominent way of understanding proper functionalism takes the idea of a design plan less literally. On this way of construing proper functionalism, the design plan of a cognitive faculty concerns how the faculty has developed to function over the course of generations of that sort of creature via the process of natural selection. That said, the end result for both versions of proper functionalism is the same\u2014to have warrant, it is necessary that one\u2019s belief be formed by a cognitive faculty that is functioning according to its design plan in the appropriate environment.
