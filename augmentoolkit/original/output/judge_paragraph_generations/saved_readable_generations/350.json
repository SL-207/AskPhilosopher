{"paragraph": " How can they mean the same thing though? After all, the sentences look completely different, and if they were spoken out loud, they would sound completely different. The answer to this question is that although these declarative sentences are different in important ways, they express the same proposition (which represents the same fact, namely that the dog is brown). It is the fact represented by the proposition that you know when you have propositional knowledge (for simplicity, we will later simply speak of knowing a true proposition). This is why an English speaker, a Span- ish speaker, and a German speaker might know that the same dog is brown, even though they would express this knowledge differently by using different sentences. 3 NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at the traditional account of proposi- tional knowledge. This is sometimes referred to as the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory because it says that knowing that some proposi- tion, p, just is having a justified true belief that p. Hence, in order for you to know that p, \u201cthe dog is brown\u201d say, you must believe that p, p must be true, and your belief that p must be justified. It also says that any time you believe that p, p is true, and your belief that p is justified you know that p. It\u2019s worth briefly examining each of these three components of the traditional account of knowledge. Belief. You might think that knowledge doesn\u2019t require belief be- cause we sometimes say things that seem to suggest this. For example, if you were in an argument with someone who believes the Earth is flat, you might plausibly say: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the Earth is spherical, I\u00a0know it is!\u201d It would be a mistake to take this as showing that you don\u2019t actually believe that the Earth spherical. Why? Because you be- have the same way as someone who believes that the Earth is spher- ical does. You answer affirmatively if asked whether the shape of the Earth is a sphere.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
