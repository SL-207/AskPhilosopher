{"paragraph": " Similarly, when it comes to the fake barn case (see A Strange County pp. 16\u201320) Martha\u2019s justified true belief fails to be sensitive. After all, Martha would still believe that the object she sees is a barn if she were looking at a barn fa\u00e7ade. Hence, Martha would believe that the object is a barn even if it weren\u2019t. Adding a sensitivity condition to the traditional account of knowledge seems to pro- vide a solution to the original Gettier cases as well as fake barns. NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 22 EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE; GETTIER PROBLEM; SENSITIVITY Let\u2019s consider a variation on A Strange County (see previous entry). It is still the case that a tornado has recently devastated the barns of Barn County. The citizens have still decided to put up barn fa\u00e7ades so that tourists will come visit the county. The one difference in this version of the case is that due to the material that is used to make the fake barns, they are all painted blue\u2014for some reason red paint eats through the cardboard that the citizens of Barn County use to make the barn fa\u00e7ades. As a result, the one real barn left is painted red, but all of the numerous fake barns are painted blue. Like the previous version of the case, Martha has decided to take a little vacation to celebrate her recent promotion. Being the barn lover that she is, Martha decides to take a trip to Barn County. Mar- tha is blissfully unaware of the situation in Barn County\u2014she has no idea that there are fake barns all throughout the county, nor does she know anything about the fact that only real barns are red. Martha is currently driving all over Barn County gazing at what she thinks are real barns. She says to herself (and believes) as she is looking at barn fa\u00e7ades: \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely barn!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s another one!\u201d \u201cAnd, another!\u201d Now, Martha happens to look at the one real barn. And thinks to her- self, \u201cWhat a lovely red barn!", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
