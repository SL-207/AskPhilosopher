{"paragraph": " There is no thing there from time to time. Nevertheless, there is a causal process that continues, each combustion leading to the next, and this is what it means to say that there is a single flame all night long. A person\u2019s surviving from day to day, throughout a lifetime, is just like the lamp\u2019s burning all night. There is no single thing that continues throughout a lifetime; rather, there are causal interactions that give rise to conscious states, and from moment to moment those states change, but there is nonetheless a continuous causal chain throughout a life. Reincarnation is then a special instance of this, but it is akin to a candle being lit from another candle. The flame passes from candle to candle, in a sense, but there is no thing\u2014 the flame\u2014that goes from one to the other. Similarly, in reincarnation there would be a causal process from one body to another such that there is a causal connection between the mental states of one and those of another, despite there being no single self or mind that passes from body to body. DISCUSSION Does the self exist, according to the Buddhist? Does the chariot? Though Buddhists are famous for holding that there is no self, the answer is more complicated than a simple \u201cno.\u201d The statements \u201cthe PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 250 self exists\u201d and \u201cthe chariot exists\u201d are conventionally true. That is, it is a matter of convention to call a certain assemblage of matter a chariot and another assemblage of matter and mental states a self. Calling one of these things \u201cchariot\u201d and the other \u201cself\u201d is helpful, but these truths don\u2019t reflect ultimate reality. You can\u2019t read metaphysics off the truth of such statements. It is conventionally true, but not ultimately true. Consider an analogy: my weather app says \u201cThe sun rises at 8 am.\u201d Indeed, dawn is at 8 am, so what the weather app said was true. But it is only true in a conventional sense since the sun doesn\u2019t really rise at all.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
