{"paragraph": " Instead, such psychological phenomena are themselves correct or incorrect, fitting or unfitting, right or wrong, good or bad. Although such properties are predicable of them, they are not themselves identical with any such properties. Just as they cannot be defined in terms of such properties, so also the latter cannot be defined in terms of them. This brings us to non-evaluative definitions of the concepts of in\u00ad trinsic goodness and badness in terms of various non-evaluative con\u00ad cepts of phenomena that are not psychological in character. There is no need to attempt here the tedious,task of running through the long list of such non-evaluative concepts suggested by various philosophers both before and after Moore down to the present. The central defect of all at\u00ad tempts to define the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness in terms of such non-evaluative concepts is that the concepts of intrinsic good\u00ad ness and badness are evaluative concepts, and such concepts are essen\u00ad tially different from and therefore cannot adequately be defined in terms of, identified with, or reduced to non-evaluative concepts. Again using \"thing\" in a broad sense, things of various kinds are intrinsically good because they have certain non-evaluative properties or exemplify certain non-evaluative universals and thus because certain non\u00ad evaluative concepts apply to them. To say, however, that they are in\u00ad trinsically good because they have such properties or because they ex\u00ad emplify such universals and thus because such concepts apply to them is not to say that their having such properties or exemplifying such uni\u00ad versals or satisfying such concepts is identical with their being intrinsi\u00ad cally good. If it were, then to say that they are intrinsically good because they have such properties, exemplify such universals, or satisfy such concepts would be to say that they are intrinsically good because they are intrinsically good.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
