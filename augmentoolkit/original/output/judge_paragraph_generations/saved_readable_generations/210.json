{"paragraph": " On the one hand, this is an epistemo- logical conclusion about what we can know by introspection. But it could be seen as making a metaphysical point as well: there are no internal seemings. If there were, then when it seemed to you that the hen had 40 spots, there would be an image, a seeming, that had 40 Color Swatches and Speckled Hens 203 spots. But, even if you had such an image, you could be wrong about it\u2014it could seem to you the image had 41 spots when it had 40. It can, in other words, seem to you that there are 40 spots without there being anything\u2014in the world or in your mind\u2014that has 40 spots. It seems to you that things are a certain way, but there is no seeming. If we don\u2019t need seemings to explain how things seem in this case, this undermines the case for positing them in the first place. The problem of the speckled hen isn\u2019t as easily resolved by the context-dependence solution that we discussed above in connection with the swatches case. One can hold the context fixed, focusing on just one image, and it seems clear that one doesn\u2019t know how many speckles there are. It is tempting to say that this isn\u2019t really a problem for the theory of seemings because it doesn\u2019t seem to you that there are, say, 39 speckles. It doesn\u2019t seem to you that there is any particular number of speckles at all. But this leads to counterintuitive results: it suggests that there can be seemings, or mental images, with speckles but no determinate number of speckles. This initially seems implau- sible (Chisholm 1942). One can presumably know in a case like this that there are more than two or three speckles and fewer than 100. But how could there be between three and 100 speckles without there being either 4, or 5 or \u2026 99? Indeed, it is likely that the image of the hen seems to have a determinate number of speckles\u2014you could count them if you liked.
