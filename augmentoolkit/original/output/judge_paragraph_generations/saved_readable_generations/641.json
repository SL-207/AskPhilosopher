{"paragraph": " No universal, taken completely in abstraction from any consideration of whether it is exemplified, can be either good or bad. And no particular, taken completely in abstraction from any considera\u00ad tion of any of the universals it exemplifies, can be either good or bad. Yet the exemplification, and also the non-exemplification, of a given universal by a given particular can be either good or bad. Similar con\u00ad siderations apply to states of affairs. No state of affairs, taken com\u00ad pletely in abstraction from any consideration of whether it obtains, can be good or bad. And the obtaining or the non-obtaining of no state of affairs, taken completely in abstraction from any consideration of the nature of the state of affairs that does or does not obtain, can be good or bad\u0440 Yet the obtaining or the non-obtaining of a given state of affairs, taken in conjunction with the nature of the state of affairs in question, can be good or bad. Ontological Categories and Bearers of Value 3 1 The preceding can also be put by saying that it is only the concrete, never the abstract, that can be good or\u00b7 bad. Abstracta, whether they be abstract universals, i.e., universals taken in abstraction from their ex\u00ad emplification by particulars, or abstract particulars, i.e., particulars taken in abstraction from the universals they exemplify, can be neither good nor bad. It is instead only the exemplification or the non-exem\u00ad plification of a given universal by a given particular that can be good or bad. Similarly, abstracta, whether they be abstract states of affairs, i.e., states of affairs taken in abstraction from any consideration of whether they obtain, or abstract obtainings or non-obtainings, i.e., ob\u00ad tainings and non-obtainings taken in abstraction from any considera\u00ad tion of which states of affairs do or do not obtain, can be neither good nor bad. It is instead only ( 1) the obtaining or the non-obtaining of a given state of affairs and (2) a state of affairs that does in fact obtain that can be good or bad.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
