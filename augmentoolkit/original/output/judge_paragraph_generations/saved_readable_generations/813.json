{"paragraph": " Thus suppose that I am the egoist in question, that I believe that my long-term interests consist in my having pleasant experiences and not having unpleasant experiences, and that I believe that my pleasant experiences, and only my pleasant experiences, are intrinsically good and that my painful experiences, and only my painful experiences, are intrinsically bad. The pleasant and painful experiences of others, I believe, are neither intrinsically good nor intrinsically bad. Such beliefs could not possibly be true. For one thing, just as my pleasant experiences are not pleasant because they are mine, so also they are not good because they are mine. Similarly, just as my painful experiences are not painful because they are mine, so also they are not bad because they are mine. If it were their being mine that makes my pleasant experiences pleasant, then their being mine would also make my painful experiences pleasant, since they too are mine. But my painful experiences are not pleasant. Similarly, if my painful experi\u00ad ences were painful because they are mine, then my pleasant experi\u00ad ences would also be painful, since they too are mine. Yet my pleasant experiences are not painful. Nor can my pleasant experiences be good and my painful experiences be bad because they are mine. If my pleasant experiences were good because they are mine, then my painful experiences would also be good, since they too are mine. Similarly, if my painful experiences were bad because they are mine, then my pleasant experiences would also be bad, since they too are mine. If my pleasant experiences are good it is not because they are mine that they Morality and Rationality 165 are good but rather because they are pleasant, and if my painful expe\u00ad riences are bad it is not because they are mine that they are bad but rather because they are painful. But if my pleasant experiences are good not because they are mine but because they are pleasant, and if my painful experiences are bad not because they are mine but because they are painful, then the pleasant experiences of anyone, and not only mine, are good, and the painful experiences of anyone, and not only mine, are bad.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
