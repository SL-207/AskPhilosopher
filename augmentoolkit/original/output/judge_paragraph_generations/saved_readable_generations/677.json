{"paragraph": " If in these circumstances the son's having his father's wealth and his having the experiences in ques\u00ad tion are both intrinsically bad regardless of whether the son likes them, as I believe they would be, then his killing his father, although it would have utility as a means of having them both, would have no positive instrumental value at all as such a means but instead would be instru\u00ad mentally bad. If the considerations presented above are acceptable, Lewis' concept of inherent value is useless for value theory. The only species of value we need acknowledge are intrinsic value and the two species of extrinsic value-instrumental value and contributory value. If something, whether it be an experience or something other than an experience, is intrinsically bad, then liking it is also intrinsically bad and disliking it 58 The Nature of Value intrinsically good; and if something, whether an experience or some\u00ad thing else, is intrinsically good, then liking it is also intrinsically good and disliking it intrinsically bad. If this is so, then Lewis has things backwards. Rather than the liking or disliking of objects and experi\u00ad ences making the latter inherently or intrinsically good or bad, it is instead their intrinsic goodness or badness that makes liking or dis\u00ad liking them intrinsically good or bad. Chapter 4 Definition, Proof, and Knowledge of Intrinsic Value In chapter 3 intrinsic value was distinguished from extrinsic value and from total value, which is the combined intrinsic and extrinsic value a thing might have, using \"thing\" in the broadest possible sense. Explica\u00ad tions of the two species of extrinsic value-instrumental and contribu\u00ad tory value-and of how they differ from intrinsic value were presented, and the concept of inherent value employed by C.I. Lewis was rejected as useless for value theory. Examples of phenomena of certain sorts that seem to be intrinsically good and of phenomena of certain other sorts that seem to be intrinsically bad have also been given.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
