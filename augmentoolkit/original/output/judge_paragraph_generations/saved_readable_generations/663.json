{"paragraph": " Thus a seventh whole might consist ( 1) of Abraham's being pleased that he has unjustifiably caused his par\u00ad ents to suffer and (2) of Isaac's being pleased that Abraham is pleased; an eighth whole might consist ( 1) of Isaac's being sorry that he has unjustifiably caused his parents to suffer and (2) of Jacob's being sorry that Isaac is sorry; a ninth might consist (1) of Jacob's being neither pleased nor sorry that he has caused his parents to suffer, even though he has done so, and (2) of Abraham's being neither pleased nor sorry that Jacob is neither pleased nor sorry, even though Abraham knows that Jacob is neither pleased nor sorry. The seventh whole, and each of its parts, is intrinsically bad. The first part of the eighth whole is intrin\u00ad sically good, the second part intrinsically bad. Since, however, the posi\u00ad tive value of the first part is greater than the negative value of the second part, the eighth whole is intrinsically good. It is not, however, as good as a whole would be that consisted of the same first part and a second part consisting of Jacob's being pleased that Isaac is sorry. The ninth whole, and each of its parts, is intrinsically bad. Neither it, however, nor either of its parts, is as bad as the seventh whole and each of its parts. 48 The Nature of Value Each of the parts of each of the nine wholes we have considered, like the wholes of which they are parts, is either intrinsically good or intrin\u00ad sically bad. Each of the parts of these wholes also has positive or nega\u00ad tive contributory value, since each contributes to the goodness or the badness of the wholes of which they are parts. None of them, however, is a means to the production or the existence of the wholes of which they are parts. Each stands to the whole of which it is a part in the rela\u00ad tion of part to whole, not in the relation of means to end. This, however, does not mean that something, a, that has instrumental value as a means to something else, b, cannot be considered as a part of a whole consisting of it and b, the end from the intrinsic value of which it derives its instrumental value.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
