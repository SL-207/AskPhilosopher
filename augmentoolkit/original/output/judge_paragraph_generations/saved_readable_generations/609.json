{"paragraph": " 6 The Nature of Value 2. Levels of Psychological Phenomena In the previous section I used the term \"valuing\" to refer to likings and dislikings as well as to what may be referred to as \"valuing proper\" or as \"valuing in the strict sense of the term\". The difference between liking and disliking on the one hand and valuing proper on the other is something like the following. In liking and disliking the emphasis, as the language suggests, is on what one likes or dislikes without neces\u00ad sarily taking what one likes or dislikes as being good or bad. In valuing proper the emphasis, as again the language \u043cuggests, is on the goodness or badness of what one likes or dislikes, as contrasted with one's liking or disliking of it. Frequently, perhaps usually, but I think not always, what one likes or dislikes one also regards as good or bad. Yet, as I think the following example shows, one's first-order likings and dislik\u00ad ings can at the second-order level themselves be liked or disliked or regarded as good or bad. Suppose that I come upon an automobile accident and like looking at the injured, bleeding, and perhaps also dead and dying victims as others render aid. I like looking at the injured victims regardless of whether I regard their plight as good or as bad or as neither. If I like looking at them without regarding their plight as good or as bad, a first-order instance of liking occurs unaccompanied by any first-order valuing proper. In such a case I like looking at them but am indifferent toward their plight. If, however, I make an evaluation of their plight, it is not necessary that I regard it as good if I am to like looking at them. Instead, I might like looking at them while at the same time regarding their plight as bad. I might even like looking at them while at the same time I do everything I can to render aid. This example suffices, I think, to show ( 1) that a first-order liking can occur regardless of whether a first\u00ad order valuing proper also occurs and (2) that a first-order liking can be accompanied by an evaluation regardless of whether the object of eval\u00ad uation is regarded as good or as bad.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
