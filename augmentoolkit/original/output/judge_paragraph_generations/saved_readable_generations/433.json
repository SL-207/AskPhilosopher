After quite a while of trying and getting nowhere, Penelope says, \u201cLook, the only reason that you are a Republican is that you grew up in Alabama and your parents are Republicans.\u201d Pedro replies, \u201cWell, you\u2019re only a Democrat because you grew up in Illinois and your parents are Democrats.\u201d Scenarios like these are familiar. The rationality of a person\u2019s beliefs is challenged on the grounds that they wouldn\u2019t have those beliefs if they would\u2019ve been born in a different place or time or to a different sort of family. The heart of the criticism here is that irrelevant influ- ences are at least partly responsible for the person believing as they do. Although this sort of criticism is perhaps most often raised in the context of challenging someone\u2019s religious, political, or philosophical CONTINGENCY OF BELIEF 87 views, if we stop and think about it something similar could be said about a great number of our beliefs. Hence, if this sort of criticism really challenges the knowledge or justification that one has in the three domains described in the above scenarios, it would seem to also challenge beliefs in other domains. Thus, while the concern about irrelevant influences doesn\u2019t lead to as widespread of a skeptical threat as some of the possibilities discussed in earlier entries, it does seem to be fairly wide-ranging and worthy of careful consideration. Although it can be difficult to spell out exactly how to best un- derstand the skeptical challenge that arises when someone presses the \u201cyou only believe that because\u2026\u201d objection, the key point is that the challenge casts doubt on the connection that the belief(s) in question bears to the truth.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
