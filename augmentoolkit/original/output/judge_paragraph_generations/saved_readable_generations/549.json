{"paragraph": " Therefore, all emeralds are green. This is such a clear example of a good inductive inference that it is often used in textbooks to illustrate induction and inductive inferences. So far so good. But, now let us think about a strange sort of predicate, grue. An object is grue just in case it is examined before the year 2100 and green or examined at 2100 or later and blue. All of our observations of emeralds have supported both the claim that they are green and the claim that they are grue (after all, all of the emeralds that we\u2019ve observed have been green and observed before the year 2100). So, it is true to say that all observed emeralds have been grue. If this is correct, it seems that we could infer that all emeralds are grue rather than in- ferring that they are all green. What are we to make of this? It might be tempting at first to say that we should just infer both that all emeralds are green and that all emeralds are grue. This would be a mistake though. After all, being green and being grue are very different. As a result, the proposition that all emeralds are green yields very different predictions than the proposition that all emeralds are grue does. The first predicts that when emeralds are observed after 2100 they will be green, but the second predicts that those emeralds will be blue. The heart of the problem of grue (which is also known as the \u201cNew Riddle of Induction\u201d\u2014the \u201cold\u201d riddle is skepticism about the NEW RIDDLE OF INDUCTION/GRUE 209 reasonability of inductive inference in general) is this question: what makes it so that we can project some properties from observed cases to unobserved cases but not others? That is to say, why is it that we can infer that all emeralds are green, but we can\u2019t legitimately infer that all emeralds are grue? A response that may immediately jump to mind is that the differ- ence is that grue is defined in terms of when objects are observed, and this makes it illegitimate, whereas green doesn\u2019t have this problem.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
