{"paragraph": " These three wholes differ in value. Since, however, let us suppose, the value of the first part of each of these wholes is the same as that of the first part of either of the others, the difference in value between the wholes issues from a difference in value between the second part of each whole. The first part of each whole is bad, since each is an instance of a son's unjustifiably causing his parents to suffer, and any such instance is bad. The second part of each whole, however, differs in value from the second part of either of the other wholes. The second part of the first whole is bad, since a son's being pleased that he has unjustifiably caused his parents to suffer is bad. The second part of the second whole is good, since a son's being sorry that he has unjustifiably caused his par\u00ad ents to suffer is good. The second part of the third whole, like the second part of the first whole, is bad, since a son's being neither pleased nor sorry that he has unjustifiably caused his parents to suffer is also bad. It is not, however, as bad as the second part of the first whole, since it is worse to be pleased that one has unjustifiably caused one's parents to suffer than to be neither pleased nor sorry that one has done so. Species of Value 45 If the preceding is correct, the first p\u0412rt of each of the three wholes is bad, since any instance of unjustifiably causing one's parents to suffer is bad. The second part of the first and third wholes are also bad, with the second part of the first whole being worse than the second part of the third whole. The second part of the second whole, however, is good. The kind of goodness and badness in question is intrinsic goodness and badness. In addition to the intrinsic goodness or badness of each part of the three wholes, each has contributory value, since each contributes to the goodness or badness of the whole of which it is a part.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
