{"paragraph": " This is the opposite of the original explanation of the phenomenon, but the experiments don\u2019t seem to rule out either explanation. (For discussion of many of these issues as well as relevant experimental results, see Cowey 2010.) There are also varying interpretations of the cases involving the pneumatic drill and the distracted driver. According to Block, the pneumatic-drill case illustrates the possibility of having phenomenal consciousness without access consciousness. But one might instead describe the case as illustrating a different possibility: the possibility of having a conscious state but not attending to it (Tye 1995, 2000; see Chapter 37). On this interpretation, you do have access consciousness of the drill\u2019s sound. You just don\u2019t attend to it. Relatedly, it could be that, in the distracted-driver case, there is phenomenal consciousness of the stimuli, but not higher-order awareness\u2014you lack awareness of your awareness of the stimuli. The distracted driver is phenomenally PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 234 conscious of the road. He just isn\u2019t, in some sense, perceiving that he\u2019s perceiving (see Armstrong 1981, Dretske 1995).
