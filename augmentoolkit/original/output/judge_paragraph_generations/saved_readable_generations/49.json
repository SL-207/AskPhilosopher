{"paragraph": " Their direct detection of these brain states enables them to refer to them. Indeed, they refer to them in something like the way we refer to states of consciousness. But there is a difference: their reference is not mediated by phenomenal qualities. Call one of the yogi\u2019s brain states \u201cA\u201d and suppose they use the term \u201cflurg\u201d to refer directly to A. Now imagine a yogi philosopher considering the nature of flurgs. Are flurgs physical? They might well conclude that flurgs are not physical, reasoning as follows. It is ideally conceivable that there should be a world that is physically and func- tionally just like our world but in which no flurgs occur. Therefore, such a world is possible, and so flurgs are non-physical. That yogi phi- losopher\u2019s argument seems to parallel the zombie argument in all rele- vant respects. And yet their conclusion is clearly false. We stipulated that flurgs are brain states, which are physical. Thus, any physical duplicate of the yogi world is guaranteed to contain flurgs. The world the yogi philosopher conceives is impossible. Something is amiss. Balog takes the case of yogis to reveal an error in the zombie argu- ment. The reason yogi philosophers can conceive of a flurg-free world that is physically and functionally just like theirs can\u2019t be that such a world is possible, because it isn\u2019t possible. The reason is rather that their flurg concept refers directly, without the mediation of physical or functional concepts. Likewise, according to Balog, the reason we can conceive of a zombie world is not that such a world is possible, CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 46 but rather because our phenomenal concepts refer directly, without the mediation of physical or functional concepts. Thus, the physicalist can respond to the zombie argument by rejecting the premise that a zombie world is possible if conceivable (that\u2019s premise (2) of the zom- bie argument, as presented in Chapter 7).", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
