OREO, AND NARRATIVE CONCEPTIONS OF THE SELF BACKGROUND The philosophical problem of personal identity is best seen as a clus- ter of problems. One problem concerns identification: What makes a given being a person? A second problem concerns reidentification: What makes a given being at one time the same person as a \u00adbeing at a later time? A third problem concerns characterization: What makes a given person the person that they are\u2014that is, which are the \u00adcharacteristics that go towards making that person the person they are (see Schechtman 1996)? Thought experiments like the Prince and the Cobbler (Chapter 39) and other body-swap cases (Chapter 41) concern the reidentification question.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
