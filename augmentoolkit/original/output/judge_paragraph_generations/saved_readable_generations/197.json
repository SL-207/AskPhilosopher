{"paragraph": " We don\u2019t have a sense impression corresponding to our idea of a substance, for example; but only have sense impressions of the qualities a substance is supposed to have. So, we should recognize that our idea of substance is flawed. In an interesting twist, however, Hume himself came up with a counterexample to this strict empiri- cism about ideas. This is the case of the missing shade of blue. THE CASE Suppose someone with good vision has experienced a large array of colors for the first 30 years of their life. They have experienced many different shades of blue, red, etc. They have not, however, experienced a particular shade of blue, S. Now, imagine they are presented with a color spectrum from light blue (A) to dark blue (Z), corresponding to all the colors they have experienced. There is a gap somewhere in the spectrum\u2014between R and T, perhaps. Despite the fact that they have never seen S, Hume suggests they can nevertheless look at R and T and imagine the shade in between them. At this point they gain an idea of S, even though they have never experienced it. This seems to be a clear counterexample to the claim that every idea must be de- rived from a corresponding sensation. DISCUSSION Oddly enough, Hume himself doesn\u2019t even attempt to resolve the prob- lem posed by the missing shade of blue. This might seem to \u00addiscredit his entire enterprise (Prichard 1950, p. 177). If we can come up with a shade of blue without experiencing it, why can\u2019t we have a concept of nec- essary connection, substance, or self \u00adwithout \u00adexperiencing those phe- nomena? To the degree that Hume relies on the principle that an idea is flawed if we can\u2019t trace it to some \u00adcorresponding sensation or group of sensations, his influential skeptical arguments seem to be in trouble. PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 192 One might try to save the Humean enterprise by pointing out that Hume only thought that simple ideas (that is, ideas that are not combina- tions of other ideas) need to trace back to particular impressions.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
