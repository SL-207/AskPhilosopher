{"paragraph": " Similarly, although a proposition p to the effect that in a given situation a person's duty is to perform a given act and acts rightly only if he does so entails and is entailed by a proposition q to the effect that he ought to perform the act in question, q is true because p is true but not vice versa. If so, then the concepts of duty and of acting rightly are more fundamental than the concept of ought. In addition to the strict sense of \"ought\" just discussed, there is also a looser sense of the term. In this looser sense, we sometimes say that a person ought to do a certain thing without intending thereby to say that he has a duty to do it or that he would act wrongly were he not to do it. Instead, what is meant is that it would be good were he to do the thing in question even though he has no duty to do it and would not act wrongly should he not do it. This sense of \"ought\" is connected with the concept of supererogation. Even though I might have no duty to give any money at all to a beggar I meet on the street and thus would not act wrongly in not giving him any, it might still be the case that I ought to give him some, in the sense that it would be a good thing to do. In this sense of \"ought,\" we ought to perform various supererogatory acts in the sense that it would be good were we to do so even though we have no duty to perform any given supererogatory act in particular as opposed to others and would not act wrongly were we not to do so. Indeed, a plausible case could be made for the view that we ought from time to time to perform at least some supererogatory acts, not simply in the sense that doing so would be good, but also in the strict sense of \"ought\" discussed above, according to which we have a duty to per\u00ad form some such acts and would act wrongly were we never to do so. On such a view, although I do not have a duty to perform any given supererogatory act and would not act wrongly in not doing so, I do however have a duty to perform some such acts from time to time and would act wrongly were I never to do so.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
