{"paragraph": " How, then, can something that is not extended in space explain the movements of things in space? 12 The Exclusion Problem 71 This is the traditional problem of mental causation for dualism. Al- though Descartes\u2019 attempts to answer this challenge are often thought to be inadequate, Princess Elisabeth\u2019s challenge seems to presuppose a mechanistic account of causation that is often rejected, even by phys- icalists. It\u2019s open to a dualist to insist that causation between mental and physical phenomena is a brute fact, underwritten by no further mechanism. While that proposal might not be completely satisfying, perhaps that\u2019s the cost of recognizing the world isn\u2019t made of one type of thing. The exclusion problem developed by Jaegwon Kim is a con- temporary version of the mental-causation problem that doesn\u2019t yield so easily to this solution. THE CASE While you\u2019re cooking dinner, your hand comes into contact with the flame. You pull your hand away. How is your reaction to be explained? On the one hand, it seems like we can give a complete explanation in physical terms\u2014we can explain why a given set of neurons fire and why the firing of those neurons leads to the contraction of muscles, etc. On the other hand, it seems that pain is involved in causing your hand to move. That\u2019s not a problem if you think pains are identical to physical states such as the firing of neurons. But many philosophers think pain and other mental states aren\u2019t identical to physical states of any kind. Most of these philosophers are not substance dualists, like Descartes, but are property dualists. They believe that even if all things are physical, some things have non-physical properties. These philos- ophers face a problem: given that everything physical can be fully explained in physical terms, what causal role is left for these distinct mental phenomena to play? They would seem to be excluded from the action by the physical events.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
