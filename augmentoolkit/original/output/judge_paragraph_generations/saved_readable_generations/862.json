{"paragraph": " As was indicated earlier, this has also been the tendency of much recent moral philosophy. This is the tendency to regard having goods alone as being intrinsically good and to regard being good only as extrinsically good as a means to the acquisition of various goods one can also some\u00ad times have without being good. Thus we frequently find recent moral philosophers endeavoring to convince us that we ought to be moral because it is rational so to be. The concept of rationality they operate with, however, is a narrow one-sided egoistic or self-interested concept. For them practical rationality consists in acting in those ways that are most likely to enable us to acquire whatever goods we might happen to want, or those goods we would want if we were fully informed or knowledgeable about the consequences of their acquisition. On this view being morally good anq acting rightly in a moral sense have no intrinsic value at all but instead have value only as a means to the acqui\u00ad sition of various goods. 3 Most of us doubtless would agree that usually we succeed more fully over the course of a lifetime in acquiring various goods by generally acting rightly in a moral sense than by not doing so. Only a simpleton, however, would believe that no situation can ever arise in which he can acquire certain goods he wants by acting wrongly rather than rightly. Most people are not such simpletons. This is shown by the fact that there are many people who not only know that they can acquire certain goods they want by lying or cheating or stealing but who also, knowing this, proceed to lie or cheat or steal and do so successfully. Morality therefore rests on a foundation that will not unfailingly support it if it has no intrinsic value in itself but instead has value only as a means to the acquisition of various goods we might happen to want. Sometimes acting rightly is useful as a means to the acquisition of such goods.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
