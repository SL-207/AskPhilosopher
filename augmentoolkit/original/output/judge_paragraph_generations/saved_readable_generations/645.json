{"paragraph": " If so, then even though abstract universals and states of affairs have no intrinsic value at all they do nonetheless have contributory value. Chapter 3 Species of Value We turn now to discuss the species of value and their relationships to one another. There are two major species of value-intrinsic and extrinsic-and two major species of extrinsic value-instrumental and contributory. These species yield the concept of total value, which is the conjunction of the intrinsic, instrumental, and contributory value of a thing, event, or state of affairs. Our treatment of these species of value will require a discussion of wholes and parts and of the world, which is that whole than which no more inclusive whole can be conceived. 1. Intrinsic, Extrinsic, and Total Value Things and events and their existence and occurrence and their non\u00ad existence and non-occurrence, as well as the obtaining and the non\u00ad obtaining of states of affairs, can have intrinsic value. For the sake of expository simplicity, however, in this section I shall speak mainly of the value of the obtaining and the non-obtaining of states of affairs, with the understanding that what is said about them applies, with the neces\u00ad sary changes, to things and events and their existence and occurrence : -,7; \u03dc ,\u00b7\u00b7. , , and their non-existence and non-occurrence.
