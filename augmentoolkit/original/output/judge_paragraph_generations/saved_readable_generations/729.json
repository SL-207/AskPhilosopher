{"paragraph": " What, for example, are the necessary and sufficient conditions that must be satisfied if an apple is to be a good apple? Even though we have little or no difficulty, after seeing, grasping, biting into, and tasting a given apple, in deciding whether it is a good apple, we still, if asked, might find it quite hard to specify with precision the necessary and sufficient con\u00ad ditions that must be satisfied if an apple is to be a good apple. We might say that it must be firm and juicy and have a certain tart sweetness. 100 The Nature of Value These might be necessary conditions of its being a good apple. But are they also the sufficient conditions, or are there also other necessary con\u00ad ditions? This example, I believe, suffices to show that even in those cases in which we have little or no difficulty in deciding whether an instance of a given kind is a good instance of that kind, we do frequently en\u00ad counter difficulty in attempting to formulate precisely the necessary and sufficient conditions that must be satisfied by any instance of that kind if it is to be a good instance. Although we might have some idea of what these conditions are, we rarely have such a precise idea that we can for\u00ad mulate it adequately with no difficulty at afl. 4. Good-Making Properties and Virtues Earlier the good-making properties of a soldier were referred to as the virtues of a soldier. The term \"virtue\" is usually applied only to the virtues of persons, as though only persons can have virtues. There is, however, another use of the term, perhaps today a bit archaic, according to which the good-making properties of the instances of a given kind are the virtues of the kind. Thus we sometimes inquire about the virtues of a certain kind or make of automobile. Just as the good\u00ad making properties of the instances of a kind other than the human kind are the virtues of the kind, so also the virtues of a person are the good\u00ad making properties of a person.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
