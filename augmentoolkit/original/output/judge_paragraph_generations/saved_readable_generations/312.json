{"paragraph": " In this chapter, we turn from issues concerning reidentification to issues concerning characteriza- tion. Facts about reidentification don\u2019t seem to capture all that\u2019s salient about our identity. For example, when it comes to our racial identity or gender identity, or the way that our selves are shaped by traumatic events and transformative experiences (see Chapter 50), the notion of 49 PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 302 personal identity in question does not seem to be one that\u2019s primarily concerned with identity over time. In addressing the characterization question, many philosophers have suggested that the constitution of self-identities involves the construc- tion of a narrative. Usually narratives are dynamic rather than static: they depict events that take place over time. They are also selective: they need not incorporate everything that has ever happened. In this way, certain personal characteristics can be highlighted as especially salient. Narratives also help situate the particular incidents and events of one\u2019s life in a larger context. But how do such narratives get devel- oped? Are they constructed by the individual themself or by others? And what constraints are there on which characteristics, incidents, and events get incorporated into a narrative? To answer these questions, philosophers have often reflected on a variety of cases, both hypothet- ical and real, several of which we consider here. THE CASES We\u2019ll start with a case drawn from real life. Barbara Adams is a \u00addie-hard Star Trek fan. She is committed to living her life according to the ideals espoused by the show. She is very active in a local Star Trek fan club, where she has attained the rank of Commander. She asks others, even outside the fan club, to use this title when addressing her. Employed by a local printing company, Barbara heads to work each day wearing a Starfleet uniform and carrying a plastic phaser and tricorder.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
