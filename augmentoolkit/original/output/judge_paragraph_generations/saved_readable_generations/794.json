{"paragraph": " On such an egoistic view of morality, a person acts rightly only if he acts as the egoistic view of practical rationality requires. The content of egoistic morality is therefore identical with the content of what may be referred to as egoistic rationality. Since what egoistic morality requires of us is identical with what egoistic rationality requires of us, a person acts rightly if and only if he acts rationally. On such a view of morality and rationality, the expressions \"right action\" and \"rational action\" are not only extensionally but also inten\u00ad sionally equivalent. Each applies to all and only those acts to which the other does, and each does so because of the meaning of the expressions \"right action\" and \"rational action\". Given the meaning of these expressions, it is impossible that one apply to any act unless the other also applies. Thus the question \"ls it rational to act morally?\" has pre\u00ad cisely the same meaning as the question \"ls it moral to act rationally?\". If, that is, \"acting morally\" or \"acting rightly\" has exactly the same meaning as \"acting rationally,\" there is no difference between asking whether it is rational to act morally and asking whether it is moral to act rationally. Indeed, given an identity of meaning between \"acting morally\" or \"acting rightly\" on the one hand and \"acting rationally\" on the other, to ask whether it is rational to act morally is to ask whether it is rational to act rationally, and to ask whether it is moral to act rationally is to ask whether it is moral to act morally. Given such an identity of meaning, the sentences \"It is rational to act morally\" and \"It is moral to act rationally\" are analytically true, and the sentences \"Sometimes it is not rational to act morally\" and \"Sometimes it is not moral to act rationally\" are self-inconsistent and therefore necessarily false\u00b7. Perhaps the major difficulty confronting such a view is that the ques\u00ad tion \"ls it rational to act morally?", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
