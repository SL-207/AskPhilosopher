PART II LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE GENERAL BACKGROUND: SKEPTICISM Philosophical skepticism comes in many varieties. The primary fea- ture shared by the various forms of skepticism is that they deny that we have knowledge in some domain. For example, a prominent form of skepticism denies that we know anything about the external world (the world outside of our own minds). Another commonality among kinds of skepticism is that they are usually motivated by appealing to thought experiments concerning possible skeptical scenarios such as that we are being deceived by a demon or that we are really just ex- periencing a computer simulation. Of course, these skeptical scenarios are often outlandish but that doesn\u2019t inhibit their functionality. All that is needed for a skeptical scenario to do its work is that the scenario be possible (in a very broad sense of \u201cpossible\u201d).", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
