{"paragraph": " If dualism is true, then mental\u2013 physical causal action is hard, if not impossible, to explain. How could an event occurring in a non-spatial, mental realm cause, or be caused by, an event occurring in a wholly distinct, spatially extended, physical realm? Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, who was a student of Descartes, pre- sented that argument in letters to him. Although she failed to convince him, versions of her argument eventually won endorsement by many philosophers of mind. Today, Cartesian dualism is widely rejected, and physicalism is the most popular view on the mind\u2013body problem\u2014 both due to causal arguments along the lines of Princess Elisabeth\u2019s and to advances in science that suggest we can give a complete causal explanation of bodily events in physical terms. But how exactly does DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-14 PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 68 the causal argument for physicalism go? And can all physicalist theories avoid the sort of problem Elisabeth raised for Cartesian dualism? This section begins by addressing those questions in Chapters 12 and 13. As interest in physicalism grew, so did the question of what form a physicalist theory should take. In the 20th century, some physicalists endorsed behaviorism\u2014the theory that identifies mental phenomena with behavioral phenomena. For example, the mental state of pain was identified with the disposition to wince, frown, etc. when one\u2019s body is damaged. But problems for behaviorism quickly arose. For example, Hilary Putnam offers a thought experiment involving an imagined species of super-spartans to show that a mental state such as pain can occur independently of any specific pattern of behavior. We discuss that thought experiment in Chapter 14. As a result of considerations such as the ones developed by Put- nam, a widespread consensus has emerged among contemporary \u00adphilosophers that behaviorism erred in failing to account for the both the inner states that underlie behavior and relations among such inner states.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
