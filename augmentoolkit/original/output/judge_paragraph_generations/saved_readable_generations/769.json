{"paragraph": " What has been said above suggests that this cannot be done, and a simple example might serve to show that this is indeed the case. Are the duties of keeping promises and of rendering aid to The Primacy of Practical Rationality 131 those in need of aid whom we can aid such that in any conceivable sit\u00ad uation one is more stringent than the other, so that in any conceivable situation in which they might conflict the more stringent of the two overrides the other? I believe the following examples show that the answer is \"no\". Suppose that I have promised a friend that I will meet him at his house at 8:00 P.M. so that he and I can go together to a movie. Suppose also that at 7 :5 5, as I am walking toward his house near a secluded lake, I hear a cry for help coming from someone thrashing about in the water on the verge of drowning. No one else is about, and I am an excellent swimmer. The drowning person clearly needs my aid, and I can render him the aid he needs. But if I do I cannot keep my promise to meet my friend at 8:00. In this situation my duty to render aid conflicts with my duty to keep my promise. I cannot fulfill both. It seems obvious that in this situation my duty to render aid overrides my duty to keep my promise, so that I act rightly only if I attempt to render aid. Consider now a second situation. Suppose that I have borrowed a hundred dol\u00ad lars from a very rich friend and,have promised to repay him by a certain date. That date has now arrived, and as I am about to enter the building in which he works to repay him in cash I see a crippled blind beggar who needs aid. I can aid him by giving him the cash I have, but if I do I cannot repay my rich friend who, let us suppose, does not need the money I owe him and has even forgotten that I have borrowed it. In this situation which duty takes precedence-that of keeping my promise or that of rendering aid? Most of us, I believe, would think that the former does, and let us suppose that in fact it does.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
