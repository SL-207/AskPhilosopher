{"paragraph": " His hatred is hatred of a person, not of being good in itself or having goods in itself, and it is because he hates the person in question that he hates that person's being good or having certain goods. Because he hates the person in question he does not want 1 14 The Nature of Value him to be what he recognizes as being a good person or to have certain goods he believes to be goods. There are other phenomena, such as envy and dislike, that are kin to hate. I can envy a person without disliking or hating him, dislike him without envying or hating him, or hate him without envying or even disliking him. I might envy a given person because I believe that he is good or better in certain respects than I am or because he has certain goods I do not have. Envying him as I do, I also might not want him to be as good as he is or to be better in certain respects than I am or to have certain goods I do not have. I might even envy him so much that I want him to be bad, or at least worse than I am, and want not only that he not have certain goods he has but also that various positive evils befall him. And I might dislike a given person so much that I do not want him to be as good as he is or to have certain goods he has, or even so much that I want him to be bad or to be visited with various positive evils. Such phenomena, although not forms of hate, since I do not hate the person I envy or dislike, are certainly kin to it. And certainly also they have something in common, which is that in all three-envy, dislike, and hatred-there is a desire either that the person envied, disliked, or hated not be as good as he is or not have certain goods he has or else that he be bad or have certain positive evils befall him. Given that they have this is common, perhaps the difference between them is only one of degree and that between them there is a continuum ascending or, per\u00ad haps more accurately, descending from envy to dislike to hate.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
