{"paragraph": " What may perhaps be referred to as the traditional distinction between these two forms of rationality is that the proper object of theoretical reason is the acquisition of true belief, knowledge, and understanding, whereas the proper object of practical reason is the guidance of conduct or practice so that as much good and as little evil as possible will be produced. Given this traditional distinction, theoretical rationality consists in adopting and using those methods of inquiry that are most likely to lead to the acquisition of as much true belief, knowledge, and understanding as p_ossible, whereas practical rationality consists in acting in those ways that are most likely to produce as much good and as little evil as possible. Given this traditional way of distinguishing between these The Primacy of Practical Rationality 123 forms of rationality, the primacy of practical over theoretical reason fol\u00ad lows as a matter of course. This is th\u0456 case because the scope of prac\u00ad tical reason is wider than and includes that of theoretical reason. This can be put by saying that the object of theoretical reason is the acquisi\u00ad tion and production of values of only one type, these being the values of true belief, knowledge, and understanding, whereas the object of prac\u00ad tical reason is the acquisition and production of values of all types. The values of theoretical reason are therefore included among those of prac\u00ad tical reason. Just as for Pascal le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne con\u00ad nait pas, so also practical reason includes within its scope values that are not within the scope of theoretical reason. Because of this, practical reason has the right to assess the importance of and to pass judgment on the legitimacy of the pursuit of the values of theoretical reason. The question of which of the two forms of reason takes precedence over the other perhaps would not arise, and certainly would not have the importance it does in fact have, if there were never any conflict between the values of theoretical reason and values of other kinds not included within the scope of theoretical reason.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
