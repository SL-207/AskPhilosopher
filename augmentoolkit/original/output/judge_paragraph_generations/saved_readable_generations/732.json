{"paragraph": " But I cannot know with certainty that he or I is courageous if neither of us is ever in a situation in which we could man\u00ad ifest courage. From the fact, however, that a person is never in a situa\u00ad tion in which he can manifest courage it does not follow that he is not courageous. Just as a glass windowpane can be brittle without ever manifesting its brittleness, so a person can be courageous without ever manifesting his courage. As we have seen, to say that a windowpane is brittle is to say that it would fly into fragments if it were struck sharply with a certain force. It is not to say that it ever is struck sharply with that force. Similarly, to say that a person is courageous is to say that he would act in certain ways in certain situations. It is not to say that he is ever in such situations. Nonetheless, even though a person can be courageous without ever manifesting his courage because he is never in a situation in which he can do so, we still cannot know with certainty that he is courageous if he is never in such situations. Although it is at least abstractly possible that a person might never be in a situation in which he can manifest courage, most, if not indeed all, of the virtues are such that throughout the course of his life each of us is presented with a wide variety of situations in which we can manifest various of the virtues. One might never be, as sometimes soldiers are, in a life-and-death situation in which courage can be manifested only by risking one's life. But courage, like most of the other virtues, can be shown in small as well as in great ways. Although occasions calling for a magnificent manifestation of a given virtue rarely present themselves, each of us in the course of daily life confronts a host of situations of var\u00ad ious sorts in which various of the virtues can be manifested in at least a small way. It is mainly through the knowledge we acquire in the course of living our daily lives about the ways in which we and others act in sit\u00ad uations of various sorts that we come to know which of the virtues are possessed by ourselves and others, and the degree to which they are pos\u00ad sessed.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
