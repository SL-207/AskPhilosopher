{"paragraph": " Instead, it suffices 54 The Nature of Value that it be such that it would be liked or disliked by someone if he were to have experience of it. Thus something can have inherent value without ever being liked or disliked by anyone because no one ever in fact has experience of it, provided that it would be liked or disliked by someone were he to have experience of it. The inherent value of such things is therefore dispositional. Intrinsic value, however, is not. It is only actual experiences that can be intrinsically good or bad. Just as the nature of certain possible states of affairs that do not in fact obtain might be such that it would be good were they to obtain, and just as the nature of certain universals that are not in fact exemplified is such that it would be good were they exemplified, so also certain possible experi\u00ad ences that are not in fact actual might be such that they would be liked or disliked by someone were he to have them. But just as states of affairs that do not in fact obtain and universals that are not in fact exemplified are neither good nor bad, so also possible experiences that are not in fact actual are neither good nor bad. The preceding, I hope, will suffice, at least for our purposes here, as an explication of Lewis' concept of inherent value and how it differs from the concepts of instrumental, contributory, and intrinsic value. It will be evident that such value, like instrumental and contributory value, would be relative. Just as a can have instrumental value only rel\u00ad ative to something else, b, to which it is a means, and just as x can have contributory value only relative to some whole, y, of which it is a part, so also something can have inherent value only relative to the liking or disliking of it by someone. Lewis' concept of intrinsic value is also such that such value turns out to be relative, since whether a given experience is intrinsically good or bad is determined by whether it is liked or dis\u00ad liked.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
