{"paragraph": " Similar considerations apply to the non-obtaining of x, y, and z. If so, then that which determines the goodness, badness, or indifference of the obtaining or the non-obtaining of any given state of affairs is the nature of the state of affairs that does or does not obtain. From this, however, it does not follow that states of affairs them\u00ad selves, taken completely in abstraction from any consideration of whether they do or do not obtain, are good or bad. This is the case because from the fact that the nature of something, such as the nature of a state of affairs, determines the goodness or badness of something 20 The Nature of Value else, such as the obtaining or the non-obtaining of the state of affairs in question, it does not follow that the former as well as the latter must itself be either good or bad. Moreover, if states of affairs, taken in abstraction from the question of whether they do or do not obtain, were themselves good or bad, that which determines their goodness or bad\u00ad ness would be something other than their obtaining or their not obtaining. If so, then it is hard to see what could determine their good\u00ad ness or badness other than their nature. But if this is so, then it would seem that it is their nature that would determine both their own good\u00ad ness or badness and also that of their obtclining if they do obtain and of their not obtaining if they do not obtain. It might be helpful if we illustrate these rather abstract considerations by means of examples. Let us suppose that the states of affairs con\u00ad sisting of John's being honest, John's being blind, and John's having brown eyes all obtain and that the states of affairs consisting of John's being dishonest, John's being sighted, and John's having blue eyes do not obtain. Let us suppose also that the obtaining of John's being honest and the non-obtaining of John's being dishonest are both good, that the obtaining of John's being blind and the non-obtaining of John's being sighted are both bad, and that the obtaining of John's having brown eyes and the non-obtaining of John's having blue eyes are both indif\u00ad ferent.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
