{"paragraph": " Flat\u2019s students come to know/ justifiedly believe facts about the shape of the Earth on the basis of his testimony. However, Mr. Flat neither knows nor justifiedly believes the facts he tells them\u2014he doesn\u2019t believe these facts at all! Cases like this seem to suggest that testimonial knowledge can be generated by someone who doesn\u2019t actually have the knowledge in question. If this is correct, it seems to be a serious problem for the transmission view of testimony. This is exactly what Jennifer Lackey and Peter Graham each claim that this sort of case shows in their seminal discussions of such cases. Lackey also claims that this kind of case poses a problem for what is called the \u201cknowledge norm of assertion\u201d. This is the idea that it is proper to assert some claim when and only when you know that the claim is true. So, according to the knowledge norm of asser- tion, we can legitimately criticize someone for asserting things that they don\u2019t know to be true. Lackey claims that there\u2019s nothing wrong with Mr.\u00a0Flat\u2019s assertions about the Earth\u2019s shape even though he lacks knowledge of these facts. After all, it doesn\u2019t seem that we could le- gitimately criticize Mr. Flat for teaching his students these facts about the shape of our planet. RESPONSES One might respond to this sort of case, as some fans of the transmis- sion view of testimony do, by maintaining that it is not really intuitive that Mr. Flat\u2019s students come to know the shape of Earth on the basis of his testimony. One way that this sort of response might be devel- oped is by arguing that the students\u2019 beliefs in this sort of case are anal- ogous to beliefs that one forms in a fake barn scenario (see A Strange County pp. 16\u201320) (Audi 2006). If this is correct, this would mean that the students\u2019 beliefs are not really knowledge. However, appealing to fake barns isn\u2019t sufficient for showing that Mr. Flat\u2019s students fail to have justified beliefs on the basis of his testimony.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
