{"paragraph": " But even the broader psychological theory is not immune to criti- cism. First, it\u2019s not clear that it really solves the worry about circularity. Just as the notion of memory might seem to presuppose personal identity, so too might the notion of intention\u2014and likewise for other psychological states. But, second, the broader psychological theory faces a major issue concerning what\u2019s become known as the problem of reduplication. (Note that the original memory theory would also face this problem.) Identity is a relation that holds 1:1. An individual at time t1 can only be numerically identical to a single individual at time t2. But psychological continuity does not seem to be a relation that holds 1:1, since it seems possible that an individual at time t1 can be psychologically continuous with many individuals at time t2. \u00adConsider the kinds of teletransportation depicted in science fiction. When the transporter is functioning normally, it scans an individual on one planet, dematerializes that individual, and then re-materializes the individual on another planet. But, in cases of transporter malfunction, the individual on the original planet might not be dematerialized, or they might be re-materialized on multiple planets. There could be an individual on Mars and an individual on Jupiter, both of whom are psychologically continuous with the individual who entered the transporter on Earth (Parfit 1984). Reduplication worries can also be generated by considering cases of uploading one\u2019s consciousness to a computer, a topic we\u2019ll consider in Chapter 42. Another kind of worry for the psychological theory arises from the fact that we don\u2019t seem to have psychological continuity with our fetus selves, especially when we consider early fetuses who lack psycholog- ical states altogether. In fact, even infants don\u2019t seem to have adequate psychological states to support the kinds of psychological connections typically invoked by those who accept the psychological theory.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
