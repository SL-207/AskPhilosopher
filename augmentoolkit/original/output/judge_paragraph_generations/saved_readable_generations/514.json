{"paragraph": " It is not an understatement to say that a very large portion of the things we know are known on the basis of testimony. For example, you know your birthdate. How? You don\u2019t remember being born. You can\u2019t deduce your birthdate from a priori principles via reasoning alone. You know your birthdate because of testimony. People have told you when you were born. If you haven\u2019t been to China, how do you know that China exists? Testimony again. If you know how far it is from your home to campus, odds are very good that you haven\u2019t measured the distance yourself but instead know this via testimony. Perhaps you used an app on your phone or Googled the distance. Any time you learn something from reading or being told, you are gaining knowledge via testimony. Hence, a whole lot of our knowledge (and, of course, our justified beliefs; see General Back- ground: The Traditional Account of Knowledge pp. 1\u20135) comes by way of testimony. When can we get knowledge or justified beliefs via testimony? One prominent answer to this question is that we can only get knowledge or justified beliefs from someone\u2019s testimony when that person knows or jus- tifiedly believes what they are telling us. The thought behind this so-called Social Epistemology 170 \u201ctransmission\u201d view of testimony is that in order for you to come to know (or justifiedly believe) that p on the basis of someone telling you that p that person must herself know (or justifiedly believe) that p. The general idea is that someone cannot give you what they don\u2019t have. A very helpful analogy for understanding the transmission view of testimony is that it is like a bucket brigade. In the past when there were fires, people would try to combat them by forming a bucket brigade. This is when one person is at a water source and fills up a bucket of water, which they pass along to the next person, who then passes it to the next person, and so on until it reaches a person who is standing near the fire and this person tosses the water on the fire.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
