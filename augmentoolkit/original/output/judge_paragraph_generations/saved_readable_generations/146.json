{"paragraph": " That stimulus, you recognize, is equally compatible with translating \u201cGavagai!\u201d as \u201cThere goes a rabbit!\u201d, \u201cThere goes an unde- tached part of a rabbit!\u201d, or \u201cThere goes a temporal stage in a rabbit\u2019s life history!\u201d (among many other candidates). And, from an objective, Rabbits and Rabbit Stages 141 scientific viewpoint, the translation-relevant evidence includes only patterns of stimuli and verbal response. Thus, you conclude, there is no fact of the matter about which is the correct translation. All of the candidates are equally correct. Can you pin down the meaning by making more empirical obser- vations of the tribe-members\u2019 linguistic behavior? Initially, that might seem promising. Suppose you surmise that their expression \u201cBleeg\u201d corresponds to the English expression \u201cis the same as.\u201d You get the rabbit to scurry by a few more times, and you notice that they say \u201cBleeg Gavagai!\u201d when it does. Could you then rule out that they mean \u201cThere goes a rabbit stage\u201d by \u201cGavagai!\u201d? Perhaps. After all, the rabbit stage you see this time is not the same rabbit stage that you saw before. But, on reflection, the very problem you tried to avoid now arises for \u201cBleeg.\u201d If you use only the objective evidence regarding stimulus and response as your guide, then you could equally translate \u201cBleeg\u201d as \u201cbelongs with,\u201d for example. On reflection, you conclude, no further observations will solve the problem. Quine uses considerations of that sort to conclude that meaning is indeterminate. That Quinean doctrine often goes under the heading of the indeterminacy of translation. But it is not just about translation or about unknown languages. It applies to all languages, including Eng- lish. If the native speakers whose language you were studying tried to make a translation manual running from English to their language, they\u2019d be led to exactly the same indeterminacy conclusions about English that you drew about their language.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
