{"paragraph": " Chapter 1 0 The Complete Human Good and Higher Education In this concluding chapter we turn to discuss some of the implications for higher education of what was said above concerning the complete human good. 1 This will require a brief discussion of the distinction between civilization and morality and their relation to one another. Our discussion in this chapter will be somewhat less abstruse than various parts of earlier chapters. Because of this, and because relevant points made in earlier chapters will be reiterated, this chapter might be intelli\u00ad gible to those who have not read what has gone before. 1. Civilization and Morality I take it that almost everyone will agree that higher education has a duty to contribute to the welfare of the wider society of which colleges and universities are but a part. This is the case, it might be argued, if for no other reason than that colleges and universities depend for their con\u00ad tinued existence upon public and private financial support from those who are not themselves faculty or students of such institutions at the time they render their support, whether willingly through private con\u00ad tributions or unwillingly through being required to pay taxes they might not always like to pay. Yet, it might by some be thought, colleges and universities can fulfill the duty in question simply by educating and training their students in the various arts and sciences and have no duty beyond this to help their students become morally good persons. Such a view seems to me to be perniciously one-sided. That it is in fact so is what I hope to show.
