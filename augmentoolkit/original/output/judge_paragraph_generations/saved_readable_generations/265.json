{"paragraph": " Williams concludes that our intuitions about body-swap cases are not to be trusted. DISCUSSION If Williams succeeds in showing that our intuitions about body-swap cases are unreliable, then he would have thereby undermined support for psychological theories of personal identity. On Williams\u2019 view, per- sonal identity requires identity of the body. In addition to the puzzle that we\u2019re discussing in this chapter, Williams (1957, 1960) has offered other reasons in support of this claim. For example, he has argued that we cannot really make sense of the concept of a particular person- ality entirely independently of the body\u2014that is, that the notion of personality and body are more intertwined than the body-swap cases allow. Let\u2019s reconsider the case of the prince and the cobbler discussed in Chapter 39. In that thought experiment, we\u2019re meant to imagine The Body-Swap Puzzle 257 that the prince and the cobbler have undergone a body swap, and that the personality of the prince now inhabits the body of the cobbler. Williams asks us to suppose that the prince has a particularly arrogant manner and that the cobbler has a high-pitched squeaky voice and a naturally cheery face. He then argues that it seems implausible that the prince\u2019s haughtiness could be conveyed by that voice and that face. In line with Williams\u2019 puzzle, a number of other philosophers have raised worries about the reliance on thought experiments in the de- bate about personal identity (see, e.g., Gendler 1998). Arguing that the thought experiments invoked in the debate about personal identity are bizarre and inconclusive, Kathleen Wilkes (1988) has suggested that we would do better to consider real-life cases instead. For ex- ample, we might consider cases of dissociative identity disorder, of amnesia and dementia, or of \u201csplit brains\u201d\u2014that is, cases involving the surgical severing of the corpus callosum (see Chapter 44).", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J"}
