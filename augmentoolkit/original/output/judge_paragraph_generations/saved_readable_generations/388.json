{"paragraph": " For instance, Ebony is aware of the fact that she\u2019s at the zoo where it is common to see zebras but not common to see mules; she has never heard of a zoo disguising mules; she has no reason to think that the zookeepers at this zoo are pranksters or dishonest, and so on. Hence, the very things that make it so that Ebony knows that she is seeing a zebra also make it so that she knows that she\u2019s not seeing a cleverly disguised mule. Thus, some respond that we can account for what is going on in this case without giving up any of the three intuitively plausible claims. NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 40 Another way that some epistemologists respond to this sort of case without denying closure is to claim that \u201cknowledge\u201d is context sen- sitive (see Going to the Bank pp. 48\u201352 for more on this). Very roughly, the idea here is that whether it is true to say of someone that they have knowledge varies with the context (Cohen 1988, DeRose 1995). So, we might think that it is true to say \u201cEbony knows that the animal is a zebra\u201d when in a context where the possibility that the animal is a cleverly disguised mule isn\u2019t relevant, before Andrew raises the possibility, say. But, once the possibility that the animal is a cleverly disguised mule is raised, it\u2019s no longer true to say \u201cEbony knows that the animal is a zebra\u201d. This response allows us to accept that Ebony does know that she\u2019s looking at a zebra (in some contexts) and also to accept that Ebony doesn\u2019t know that she\u2019s not looking at a cleverly disguised mule (in some contexts) without giving up closure.
