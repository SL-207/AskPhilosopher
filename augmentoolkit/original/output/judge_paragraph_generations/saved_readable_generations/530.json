{"paragraph": " She notices a customer eating lunch by himself that has been assigned to a different server. The customer is a member of the particular minority group that Karen has researched. Karen believes \u201che\u2019s not going to leave a good tip.\u201d It turns out that Karen was correct, and this person left a tip that is below the average for the restaurant. Many insist that Karen\u2019s belief is morally wrong despite being well supported by evidence. And a number claim that this isn\u2019t simply a moral matter\u2014they claim that Karen\u2019s belief isn\u2019t epistemically justi- fied because the moral import of the belief makes a difference to what is required for justification. As the case is constructed, it seems that Karen has good evidence for thinking that the customer isn\u2019t going to leave a good tip\u2014the statistics suggest that it is 80\u201395% likely that he won\u2019t. Nevertheless, some argue that Karen\u2019s belief isn\u2019t justified de- spite this good evidence. Assuming that the evidence is strong enough in general to believe (that is, assuming that 80\u201395% probability that p is generally sufficient for making one justified in believing that p), this case is a counterexample to evidentialism if Karen\u2019s belief isn\u2019t justified. After all, evidentialism holds that all that matters when it comes to jus- tification is the evidence that one has. But, if Karen\u2019s belief isn\u2019t justi- fied in spite of her having very good evidence, then evidentialism gets this case wrong. Similar to pragmatic encroachment, \u201cmoral encroach- ment\u201d contends that the moral implications of one\u2019s beliefs affect how SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY 188 much evidence is necessary for a belief to be justified. Hence, moral encroachment says that Karen\u2019s evidence would be good enough to make her belief justified if the evidence concerned something without moral import, but since this belief is harmful to the group to which the customer belongs, more evidence is required for justification.", "metadata": "Epistemology_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments-Routledge (2021)"}
