{"paragraph": " A fifth possible extreme answer to our question is that it is good to dislike all the indifferent things of which one has experience or knowl\u00ad edge. Given that many, perhaps most, of the things of which we have experience or knowledge are indifferent, disliking all such indifferent things would lead to far greater unhappiness for the person who suc\u00ad ceeded in doing so than would be likely to result if he disliked only the bad things of which he has experience or knowledge. \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\" and the unhappiness issuing upon our dis\u00ad liking the bad things of which we have experience or knowledge would seem to exist in a quantity sufficiently great without the addition of the unhappiness that would result from our disliking indifferent as well as bad things. Moreover, the unhappiness issuing from a person's disliking the existence of bad things does not seem to be completely bad, whereas that issuing from one's disliking the existence of indifferent things would seem to be. If it is good to dislike the existence of bad things ( and such dislike does seem to be good), and if the natural issue of such dis\u00ad like is some degree of unhappiness over the existence of such things, then such unhappiness is fitting or appropriate and, as such, is itself good or at least, if not good, is not as bad as it would be if it were not appropriate. Rather, however, than its seeming to be good to dislike the existence of indifferent things, it seems instead to be bad, or at least to be i1\u045bdifferent. If so, then the unhappiness that would naturally issue from the existence of the indifferent things one dislikes would not be appropriate and therefore would lack the goodness it would have were Attitudes toward the Indifferent 1 8 1 it appropriate. Lacking such goodness, it would seem not to be good at all and, indeed, to be intrinsically bad. We have examined briefly five extreme answers to the question of whether it is good, bad, or neither good nor bad to like, to dislike, or to be indifferent toward indifferent things.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
