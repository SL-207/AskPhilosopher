{"paragraph": " If any of the parts of a whole, whether it be a piece Species of Value 43 or a moment, contributes nothing at all to the value of the whole, then it has no contributory value at all. In order that a part of a whole have contributory value it is sufficient that it contribute to the positive value of the whole if its contributory value is positive, to the negative value of the whole if its contributory value is negative. Thus for a part to have positive contributory value it is not necessary that it be such that no other possible part put in its place would contribute to making the whole even better. Just as a given whole of a given kind can be a good whole of that kind without being such that no whole of that kind could be even better, so also a given part of a given whole has positive contributory value if it contributes to making the whole a good whole even though it does not contribute to making the whole as good as it would be if the part in question were replaced by some other possible part. Precisely similar considerations, with of course the obvious necessary changes, apply to negative con\u00ad tributory value. Thus the specific shade of brown covering the surface of our table has positive contributory value if it contributes to making the table beautiful even though there be some other shade of brown that would make the table even more beautiful. Similar considerations apply to instrumental value. In order that something have positive instrumental value it is sufficient that it be a means to the existence or occurrence of something good. Thus some\u00ad thing, a, has positive instrumental value if it is a means to the existence of something, x, that is intrinsically good even though a be such that its replacement by something else, b, would result in the existence of some\u00ad thing, y, that would have greater positive intrinsic value than the exis\u00ad tence of x has. In the situation envisaged, b would have greater positive instrumental value than a has because b is a means to the existence of something, y, that has greater positive intrinsic value than x has.", "metadata": "The Nature of Value_ Axiological Investigations-Ramon M"}
