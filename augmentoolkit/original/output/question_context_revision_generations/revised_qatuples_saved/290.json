{"paragraph": " They’re each puzzled by this, since the recipe of the coffee has not changed at all over the years, and chemical analyses of current coffee samples show consistency with the chemical analyses of coffee samples from when they started at the company. Moreover, all the other members of the coffee tasting team affirm that the coffee tastes exactly the same as it always has, and that it’s just as good as ever. Imagine that one afternoon over tea Chase and Sanborn get to talking about their dissatisfaction. As they talk, they realize that, al- though they share their dislike for the company’s coffee, they’d offer different diagnoses of what the problem is. Chase is convinced that his preferences have shifted over time. The coffee still tastes exactly the same to him, he reports, but he no longer likes that taste. In con- trast, Sanborn denies that her preferences have shifted. Instead, she is convinced that her gustatorial system must have changed in some way, so that the way it processes the same coffee is now different. To cast it as Dennett does, we might explain their respective situations by saying The Coffee Tasters 51 that Chase thinks that his tastes have changed, while Sanborn thinks that her tasters (her tastebuds) have changed. But now consider the following question: How does each know that they’re right about what’s happened? Perhaps Chase is really in the situation that Sanborn is in, or vice versa. Or perhaps they are each in a situation that’s midway between the two, with some change of tastes and some change of tasters. How could they ever sort it out? There doesn’t appear to be any way they could do so from the inside, by reflecting on their experiences. But perhaps they could get clarity some other way. We might do some tests on Sanborn’s gusta- tory system to see whether it is functioning normally. Suppose the tests come back with the result that the system is functioning just the same as it always did.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Can Chase and Sanborn determine the correct explanation for their differing opinions about the coffee from their own experiences?", "answer": "No, Chase and Sanborn cannot determine the correct explanation for their differing opinions about the coffee from their own experiences.
