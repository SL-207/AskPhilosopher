{"paragraph": " That’s because your use of “green” is grounded in events that took place on Earth, such as your perceiving green things and interacting with others. But, according to Ned Block (1990), this will gradually change. For example, after enough time has passed, the typical cause of your phenomenally green experiences will be interaction with red things. And Block takes this to show that qualia can’t be identified with representational properties, at least as representational properties are typically characterized. He also takes Inverted Earth to vindicate qualia realism, on which there are intrinsic mental features of our experience: features that are not grounded in relations—environmental relations, functional relations, or any other PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 120 relations. In Block’s view, if there were no such intrinsic features, then your qualia would gradually change as their representational features do. But your qualia don’t gradually change in that way. Block’s argument depends on controversial premises. For example, some challenge the premise that the phenomenal (qualitative) character of your mental states remains constant as their representational charac- ter shifts (Lycan 1996, Tye 2000). And some detach representationalism from the causal co-variation account of representational properties. For example, on one view, the phenomenal character of color experiences is intrinsically representational; what it represents depends only par- tially on the environment (Chalmers 2004). But it is interesting to note that the Inverted Earth case involves an inversion that is the con- verse of the more traditional inverted qualia cases. Instead of inverting the qualia and keeping the representational (or functional or physical) properties constant, in this case it is the ­representational properties that are inverted while the qualia are kept constant.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What does Ned Block take this to show?", "answer": "Ned Block takes this to show that qualia can't be identified with representational properties, at least as representational properties are typically characterized.", "question_group_id": "2b47b239-1a27-4d4f-8339-6c1a1a57f494", "paragraph_idx": 67, "question_idx": 1}
