{"paragraph": " DISCUSSION Balog’s argument could be seen as an instance of the phenomenal concept strategy for rejecting the zombie argument (and related ­arguments, such as the knowledge argument). This strategy accepts the conceivability of zombies, but explains it in terms of special ­features of phenomenal concepts rather than special features of the ­phenomenal properties those concepts pick out (Stoljar 2005). Balog’s argument also has much in common with a related strategy, on which ­phenomenal concepts are construed as conditional concepts: they refer to physical states if the world is entirely physical, and to non-physical states if the world is not entirely physical (Hawthorne 2002, Stalnaker 2002, Braddon-Mitchell 2003; but see Alter 2007.). Like the phenomenal concept strategy, the conditional analysis strategy defends physical- ism by appealing to claims about phenomenal concepts. But, unlike the phenomenal concept strategy, the conditional analysis is used to challenge the premise that zombies are conceivable rather than the premise that zombies are possible if conceivable. Zombie-argument proponents, such as David J. Chalmers (2007, 2010), respond to Balog’s argument by rejecting her analogy between zombies and yogis. Chalmers suggests that the yogis’ flurg concept differs significantly from phenomenal concepts (or at least from the sorts of phenomenal concepts that are most relevant to the zombie ar- gument). The yogis’ flurg concept is a kind of demonstrative concept: its content could be roughly expressed as “this inner state, whatever that turns out to be.” By contrast, phenomenal concepts do not seem to be demonstrative concepts. For example, the pain concept picks out a state with a certain distinctive phenomenal quality. That state might or might not be physical; but, either way, it must have that distinctive phenomenal quality if it is to be the reference of the pain concept.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the phenomenal concept strategy, and how does it relate to the zombie argument?", "answer": "The phenomenal concept strategy is a way of rejecting the zombie argument and related arguments, such as the knowledge argument.
