{"paragraph": " That role might happen to be played by brain states; but things made of different stuff (robots perhaps) can have beliefs too because other materials (silicon chips and circuits, perhaps) play the belief role. So, even though in humans belief roles are played by physical states and processes, being a belief is not iden- tical with some type of physical state or process. The non-reductive physicalist faces the exclusion problem no less than the dualist: as long as mental properties are distinct from a set of properties that can do all the causal work, they would seem to be epiphenomenal with respect to the physical world, lacking physical efficacy of their own. DISCUSSION Although the exclusion problem applies to both dualism and non-­ reductive physicalism, these different camps tend to offer different responses to the problem. The non-reductive physicalist, but not the dualist, can take advantage of the fact that mental properties bear very The Exclusion Problem 73 close relations to physical properties. Mental properties are, for ex- ample, realized or constituted by physical properties. To return to the functionalist example we considered earlier, brain states that play the belief role are said to be the physical “realizers” for the belief, or might be said to “constitute” the belief. So, for the non-reductive physicalist, although being a pain is distinct from a particular physical kind—such the firing of a particular group of neurons—it doesn’t exist inde- pendently of the physical. As a rough analogy, being a queen in chess isn’t identical with a physical type either: I can have a plastic queen shaped like Marge Simpson and you can have a marble queen shaped like Daenerys Targaryen; but what makes these things queens in chess aren’t those physical characteristics. Nevertheless, a movement of those pieces isn’t independent of the physical movement of the shaped plastic or marble.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is an analogy for how mental properties are related to physical properties in non-reductive physicalism?", "answer": "The analogy is that of a queen in chess. Just as being a queen in chess is not identical with a particular physical type (e.g., a plastic or marble queen), being a mental property is not identical with a particular physical property. However, the movement of the queen is not independent of the physical movement of the plastic or marble queen.", "question_group_id": "7557e228-d1d5-48d6-ad69-885a114a487f", "paragraph_idx": 186, "question_idx": 3}
