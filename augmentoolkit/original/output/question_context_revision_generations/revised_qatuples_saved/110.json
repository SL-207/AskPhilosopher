{"paragraph": " Her argument is wholly secular. THE CASE Most thought experiments begin directly with contemplation of a proposed scenario; but the one we consider in this chapter requires a brief prelude—and, unfortunately, the prelude involves a bit of pain. Pinch yourself, say, on the underside of your left arm. You don’t have to pinch very hard, but you should pinch forcefully enough that you CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 14 can focus on the pain you’re feeling. Once you have that pain in focus, the thought experiment itself can begin. Imagine that you are feeling the very same pain you are feeling right now, even though you are completely disembodied. In this state, you experience the very same pain you are feeling right now, and it feels to you that the pain is on the underside of your left arm; but you don’t have a left arm. Not only do you not have a left arm, but you also don’t have a right arm. You have no bodily parts whatsoever. By successfully engaging in this thought experiment, you conceive of a case of disembodied pain. According to a long philosophical tra- dition, whatever is conceivable is possible. Granted, we can conceive of things that are physically impossible (or at least improbable), as when I conceive of dropping a tennis ball and having it float unsupported rather than falling to the ground. But the sense of possibility intended is not physical possibility but, rather, something stronger—sometimes put in terms of metaphysical possibility and sometimes put in terms of logical possibility. Even if it is not physically possible for the ball to float unsupported, it is logically possible. In contrast, it is not logically possible for the ball to be at the same time both wholly spherical and wholly cubical. Moreover, if you were to try to conceive of this, you would fail. (Try it!) Given that you can conceive of a case of disembodied pain, it is (log- ically) possible for the particular pain under consideration to occur in a disembodied being.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the first step in a thought experiment to imagine disembodied pain?", "answer": "The first step is to pinch yourself on the underside of your left arm, focusing on the pain you feel, but not pinching too hard.", "question_group_id": "a739a016-a766-4cea-9b62-ba1252dd9672", "paragraph_idx": 9, "question_idx": 0}
