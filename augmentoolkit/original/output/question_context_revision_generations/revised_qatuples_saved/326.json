{"paragraph": " Those features of the heart just wouldn’t be apparent on that level. Perhaps the same is true of the brain (Searle 1983, pp. 267–8). Leibniz could be making an even stronger claim, though: it is in- conceivable that something like the pushing and pulling of gears, or anything else mechanical, could explain something like thought or perception. This brings the argument closer in some ways to more contemporary conceivability arguments, such as the zombie argument discussed in Chapter 7. But it could again be objected that we simply don’t have a sufficient grasp of how the activity of material things generates thoughts or perceptions. If we knew more, either about the way the movements of the parts generated properties in the whole or about thought itself or perception itself, we wouldn’t have such diffi- culty conceiving of material minds. Still, defenders of Leibniz’s argument will insist that there is a difference in kind between material movements and thoughts and perceptions, at least when thoughts and perceptions are conscious. Material movements concern how things operate in space and time, while consciousness is about how things feel—what it’s like for the being that has conscious experiences. It’s not clear why, no matter how complicated the movement, material operations should feel like anything. It’s important to remember that the question isn’t whether material operations could give rise to thoughts or perceptions—with the addition of laws, connecting thoughts to movements in space, they certainly could. But that would involve adding something to the machine. If something must be added, the machine isn’t all there is. RECOMMENDED READING CANONICAL PRESENTATION Leibniz, G. W. 1989. Monodology.
