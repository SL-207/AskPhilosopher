{"paragraph": " Even if the brain generates experience, that is a mere contingent fact; everything about the brain might be just as it is, and yet no experience is generated. If so, then consciousness itself is wholly different from anything physical. To put it another way, since nothing physical can bridge the explana- tory gap, we need to appeal to something non-physical. Otherwise, the connection between consciousness and the physical world will remain forever mysterious. DISCUSSION The hard problem has long been recognized. For example, Thomas Nagel’s 1974 classic “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” begins with the following sentence: “Consciousness is what makes the mind-body problem really intractable.” And in 1866, T. H. Huxley wrote, How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of initiating nerve tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin, where Aladdin rubbed his lamp in the story. Philosophers of earlier eras doubtless understood the problem no less acutely than Chalmers, Nagel, and Huxley do. Even so, work on it has intensified considerably since the publication of Chalmers’s 1995 article, “Facing Up to the Hard Problem of Consciousness,” and his influential 1996 book, The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory. Some regard the hard problem as insoluble. For example, according to Colin McGinn (1989), although there is a naturalistic solution, we humans are “cognitively closed” to it, due to limitations in our ­concept-forming abilities. In his view, we simply cannot form con- cepts that would enable us to see why, for example, undergoing a certain type of brain process must be felt as pain, even if pain were identical to that brain process. Daniel Stoljar (2005) also doubts that we are currently positioned to solve the problem; but, unlike McGinn, CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 22 Stoljar thinks that might change.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Is it possible that consciousness could be physically identical to brain processes, but still remain a mystery to us?", "answer": "Yes, it is possible that consciousness could be physically identical to brain processes, but still remain a mystery to us. This is because nothing physical can bridge the explanatory gap between consciousness and the physical world, and therefore we may need to appeal to something non-physical to explain consciousness.", "question_group_id": "30ed4e41-ae8e-4e12-ba57-fd17d538d2eb", "paragraph_idx": 61, "question_idx": 1}
