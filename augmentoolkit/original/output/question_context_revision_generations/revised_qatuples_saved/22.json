{"paragraph": " Your preferences and reactions affect the qualia of your experience. If we accept this explanation, however, then we admit that qualia have a relational profile, and we would thus have to deny that they are intrinsic. This presents yet a further departure from the traditional conception of qualia. DISCUSSION Dennett takes the coffee tasters thought experiment to reveal a deep incoherence in the traditional conception of qualia. We can’t really know what qualia we’re having, and we can’t really separate qualia from our reactions to them. In his view, the very notion of qualia is so thor- oughly confused that it should be retired from philosophical discussion. In rejecting the traditional notion of qualia, Dennett endorses a philosophical view known as eliminativism (or sometimes eliminative materialism). According to eliminativists, our ordinary and intuitive understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and misguided. To defend this point, eliminativists often draw a comparison to our ordinary and intuitive understanding of physics. There are deep mistakes interwo- ven throughout our intuitive conception of physics (often called folk physics)—for example, the idea that a heavier ball falls faster than a lighter one. Likewise, eliminativists say, there are also deep mistakes interwoven throughout our intuitive conception of the mind (often called folk psychology). In rejecting and replacing folk theories, we dis- card the mistaken posits of the theory. Thus, given that many of our mental state categories are posits of folk psychology, it shouldn’t be surprising that they too need to be discarded as we come to develop a more sophisticated and scientific theory of mind. Early eliminativists tended to focus on mental states like beliefs and desires (see, e.g., Churchland 1981). More recently, many philosophers of an eliminativist bent have turned their attention to consciousness and have developed a view that’s come to be known as illusionism (Frankish 2016, Kammerer 2021).", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is illusionism, and how does it relate to the concept of qualia?", "answer": "Illusionism is a view that consciousness is an illusion, and that our experiences of qualia are not objective features of the world, but rather a product of our brain's processing of information.", "question_group_id": "985fb2e1-f3fd-403a-8622-fa538cfe7a23", "paragraph_idx": 53, "question_idx": 4}
