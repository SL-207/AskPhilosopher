{"paragraph": " For the purpose of this chapter, we will focus on the first of these strands. Some AI researchers working with systems engaged in symbol manipulation are concerned only with developing systems that produce certain intelligent behaviors. Although such systems may simu- late intelligence, it is not claimed that they are actually intelligent. There are other researchers, however, who aim to develop systems that not only simulate intelligence but also exhibit actual intelligence. In developing the thought experiment discussed in this chapter, Searle (1980) refers to the former as “weak” AI and the latter as “strong” AI. Though Searle was not the first philosopher to mount an attack on AI (see especially Dreyfus 1972), his thought experiment has proved especially influential. THE CASE Imagine that you are alone in a room that contains a rulebook and a bunch of pieces of paper with characters that you cannot parse. They 18 The Chinese Room 105 mean nothing to you. Indeed, you do not even know whether they are characters in a language; to you, they are just meaningless shapes. The rulebook contains a very long list of rules that all have the same form: “If ____, then do _____.” In each rule, the blanks are filled in with some of the same characters written on the pieces of paper. Soon someone outside the room slips a piece of paper in via a slot in the door. The paper is inscribed with some of these same characters. Consulting the rulebook, you find that the rule numbered 572 has the relevant characters in the first blank. You then find the piece of paper inscribed with the characters from the second blank in rule 572 and slip it out through the slot in the door. Almost immediately, another piece of paper comes through. The characters written on this paper correspond to the characters in the first blank for the rule numbered 394. Once you find the piece of paper inscribed with the characters from the second blank for rule 394, you slip it out through the slot.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Can a machine truly be said to be intelligent if it can only simulate intelligence, but not exhibit actual intelligence?", "answer": "No, it cannot.
