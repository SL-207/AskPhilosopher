{"paragraph": " But, as Burge (1982) ar- gues, Alfred could equally well be described as having the same belief content at both times, just applied (unwittingly) to two distinct apples. So, this case does not adequately establish externalism. Burge’s argument for externalism is more subtle. He appeals to two thought experiments. One is Twin Earth, a case originally devised by Hilary Putnam (1975) for a related purpose (Putnam was concerned with the reference of terms, whereas Burge is concerned with the contents of mental states). The other is Burge’s own (1979) arthritis case. THE CASES Putnam (1975) imagines a near duplicate of our planet Earth, which he calls Twin Earth. There is one key difference: on Twin Earth, the liquid that runs through the rivers and faucets, and which is called “water” in the language some Twin Earth inhabitants call “English,” is not H2O. Their liquid has an entirely different chemical composi- tion, XYZ—where X, Y, and Z are elements not presently known to us. Putnam claims that the liquid on Twin Earth is not water, despite the superficial similarity it bears to water. Burge agrees: it is what we might call twin-water instead. Putnam’s and Burge’s view about water and “twater” is widely shared. Water is a natural kind—a kind found in nature, which was not human-made. The fundamental nature of such a natural kind is determined not by superficial qualities, such as how it appears to humans, but rather by the underlying, more basic features, such as chemical composition. Suppose Amari is an Earthling who doesn’t know that water is H2O. Now consider her Twin Earth counterpart, AmariTE. Amari and ­AmariTE are duplicates in many respects. Their behavioral dispositions, Twin Earth and Arthritis Man 155 their inner functional states, and their qualitative conscious states are indistinguishable. They are also physically indistinguishable, save for the fact that Amari’s body contains water and AmariTE’s contains twin-water.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Suppose there are two individuals, Amari and AmariTE, who are duplicates in many respects, except that Amari contains water and AmariTE contains twin-water. What does this imply about the relationship between the contents of their mental states and the substances they contain?", "answer": "This implies that the contents of their mental states are determined by the substances they contain, rather than by their behavioral dispositions, inner functional states, or qualitative conscious states. In other words, their mental states are determined by their external environment, specifically the substances they contain.", "question_group_id": "cd94fa13-44b8-4107-824a-e6ccae34a59e", "paragraph_idx": 70, "question_idx": 2}
