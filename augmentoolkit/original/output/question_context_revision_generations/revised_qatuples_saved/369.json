{"paragraph": " But that is a minority view. Type-A materialists more typically accept the existence of con- sciousness, but argue that it is a mistake to think that any problem regarding its existence or its nature will remain after the so-called easy problems have been solved. For example, Patricia Churchland (1996) argues that, insofar as we cannot imagine how that would work, this is attributable to our own limitations—and that we have good reason to expect that further scientific progress will overcome The Hard Problem of Consciousness 23 them. (We will return to Churchland’s response to the hard problem in Chapter 10.) In a similar vein, Daniel Dennett (1996) concludes that if we re- move all functional features of our experience, there is nothing left to explain. He reaches that conclusion by taking a “third-person perspec- tive” on his own experiences—viewing himself objectively, from the outside, so to speak (he refers to this method as heterophenomenology). Indeed, his conclusion might seem inevitable unless one considers consciousness subjectively, from the inside—that is, from the first-­ person perspective. One might regard taking information acquired from the first-person perspective as unscientific. But, if we are trying to understand consciousness, that attitude strikes many philosophers as overly restrictive. Type-B materialists agree that the hard problem does not reduce to a bunch of easy problems. But they deny that this indicates that the universe itself must contain some extra non-physical ingredient. These philosophers often attribute the hard problem to how we think about conscious experience, rather than to conscious experience ­itself. In other words, they blame the hard problem on our concepts of ­consciousness. This approach is known as “the phenomenal concept strategy” (Stoljar 2005, Balog 2012). Though popular, the phenomenal concept strategy faces ­serious challenges.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the main argument of Patricia Churchland?", "answer": "Patricia Churchland argues that if we cannot imagine how consciousness works, it is because of our own limitations, and that further scientific progress will eventually overcome these limitations.", "question_group_id": "3604c332-7b9d-4750-afd5-45a8574ed118", "paragraph_idx": 75, "question_idx": 1}
