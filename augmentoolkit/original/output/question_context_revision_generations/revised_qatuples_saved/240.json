{"paragraph": " Fodor’s answer is that there cannot be disjunctive kinds. But why not? Kim offers an example to help us see what might be problem- atic about disjunctive kinds. Jade, it turns out, is not a single mineral. Instances of jade are either instances of the mineral nephrite or the mineral jadeite. It is, in fact, a disjunctive kind. Can we treat that as just a kind like any other? The problem is that there is no guarantee of any causal similarity between jadeite and nephrite. They could be—and in fact are—very different physically. This means that, as a kind, jade cannot be used to confirm interesting generalizations. Suppose one found 1000 pieces of jade and discovered they were all green. Suppose further that all the pieces of jade one found were jadeite. Kim claims this would not support the generalization that all jade was green. You PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 80 would have found some confirmation that all jadeite is green; but, because of the disunified nature of jade as a kind, you can’t conclude anything about other instances of jade from your evidence—they might be nephrite and you don’t know anything about nephrite! In particular, you don’t know that all—or indeed any—nephrite is green. What makes something apt for inclusion in scientific laws—i.e., what makes it a natural kind—is that it has enough unity as a kind for ob- servations about one instance to bear on observations on all instances of the kind. So, the reason we should reject disjunctive kinds like jade is that they lack such unity. At this point, Kim seems only to have given Fodor a premise for his own argument—since disjunctions can’t be kinds and can’t enter into laws, there can be no disjunctive physical law corresponding to the special science laws. But, says Kim, there is a problem. Jade is dis- junctive whether you call it “jade” or whether you call it “jadeite or nephrite.” So why aren’t economic kinds disjunctive, whether you call them “dollar” or “P1 or P2”?", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Can a disjunctive kind, such as jade, be treated as a regular kind for the purposes of scientific laws?", "answer": "No, a disjunctive kind like jade cannot be treated as a regular kind. This is because there is no guarantee of any causal similarity between the different components of the disjunctive kind, which means that observations about one instance of the kind may not bear on observations about other instances.", "question_group_id": "4dae5aca-16f3-4b56-9a85-9921a9ee9e3d", "paragraph_idx": 10, "question_idx": 0}
