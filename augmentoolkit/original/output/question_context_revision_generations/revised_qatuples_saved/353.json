{"paragraph": " 135–6). His moral concerned humility: some “tough-minded slugs” ­incorrectly thought their science, or mere extensions thereof, could explain all of nature. The discussion of Jackson’s slugs appears at the end of the 1982 article where he first presents the knowledge argument. By ­contrast, Stoljar (2006) takes his own slug example to undermine ­Jackson’s knowledge argument. Stoljar’s moral is that the knowledge and conceivability arguments owe their apparent force to ignorance— ignorance of physical facts that are, at least currently, unknown (see Chapter 10; for similar responses, see Nagel 1974, McGinn 1989, van Gulick 1993, Polger 2004, Churchland 1996). Stoljar argues in detail that our situation parallels that of the slugs and the tiles. He invokes historical precedents: situations where argu- ments similar to the knowledge and conceivability arguments turned out to derive from ignorance. For example, in 1925 C. D. Broad pre- sented an argument similar to the knowledge argument to show that there are irreducible truths about chemical bonding—an argument that can no longer be sustained in light of the quantum-mechanical theory of chemical bonding (which was not widely known in 1925). In response, proponents of the knowledge and conceivability ar- guments sometimes point to disanalogies between those arguments and the historical precedents Stoljar cites (Alter 2023). Broad’s argu- ment concerns whether certain truths about chemical bonding can CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 64 be deduced from truths about more fundamental physical properties. Plausibly, all truths concerned—including both the chemical truths and the more fundamental physical truths—are structural: they are all truths about spatiotemporal causal structure. They are the sorts of truth that can be fully expressed in an abstract, mathematical ­language. By contrast, the knowledge argument concerns whether certain ­phenomenal truths (truths about consciousness) can be deduced from structural physical truths.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the moral or lesson that can be derived from Jackson's use of the slug example?", "answer": "The moral or lesson that can be derived from Jackson's use of the slug example is humility in understanding the nature of reality.
