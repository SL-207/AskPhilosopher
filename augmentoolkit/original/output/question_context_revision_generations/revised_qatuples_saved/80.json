{"paragraph": " In putting forth his naturalist view, one according to which he privileged the methods and techniques of science above all else, Quine frequently cast doubt on the usefulness of some of our most central philosoph- ical notions—notions like meaning, thought, belief, experience, and necessity. In “Quining Qualia,” Dennett offers a number of thought experiments—or what he refers to as “intuition pumps”—with the aim of casting similar doubt on the usefulness of the notion of qualia. Especially central to his case is the example of the coffee tasters, which we will focus on here. 9 CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 50 Qualia (also known as phenomenal properties) are properties of experiences (see Chapters 4 and 5). For example, these are the prop- erties in virtue of which there is something it is like to feel a sharp stitch of pain in your side or to smell the sweet and fragrant scent of a blooming lily. Dennett works with a notion of qualia that he takes to be firmly embedded in philosophical treatments of the mind: (1) qualia are ineffable, i.e., they cannot be fully or adequately described; (2) qualia are intrinsic properties, i.e., they cannot be analyzed merely in terms of their relations to other things; (3) qualia are directly or immediately apprehensible in consciousness, i.e., one can introspect them; and (4) qualia are private, i.e., no one other than the individual who is having them can directly or immediately apprehend them. THE CASE Imagine two individuals we’ll call “Mr. Chase” and “Ms. Sanborn” who have worked for the last decade as coffee tasters in the quality control division of a coffee company. When Chase and Sanborn first started at the company, it seemed like a dream job. What could be ­better than spending a lot of time tasting the coffee that they both love? Recently, however, they are no longer quite as fond of their jobs, as each finds that they no longer like the taste of the company’s dis- tinctive coffee blend.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Describe a situation involving two coffee tasters, Mr. Chase and Ms. Sanborn, who have changed their job satisfaction over time.", "answer": "Mr. Chase and Ms. Sanborn, who were initially enthusiastic about their jobs as coffee tasters, have recently become disenchanted with their work.
