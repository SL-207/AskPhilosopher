{"paragraph": " They address him by a name that isn’t his, and no one seems to believe him when he says that he’s the prince. They all think he must be joking, and they chide him for being late for work. So, who has woken up in the cobbler’s bed? Is it the prince or the cobbler? According to Locke, the answer is obvious. Though the individual has the cobbler’s body, he is clearly the same person as the prince. DISCUSSION Locke uses the prince and the cobbler case as support for what contemporary philosophers have referred to as the memory theory PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 242 of personal identity (though see Behan 1979 for an argument that the interpretation of Locke as a memory theorist is mistaken). What makes an individual at one time the same person as an individual at another time is not a soul or a body, but rather the continuity of con- sciousness that enables the individual at the later time to remember the experiences of the individual at the earlier time. Even having the same soul (without any memories accompanying it) is not enough. If we discovered that the prince somehow had the same soul as Nestor of Troy but didn’t remember anything about Nestor’s experiences or about Troy, we should not identify the prince as the same person as Nestor. Likewise, though it might not be immediately apparent to those who interact with the cobbler’s body that they are really inter- acting with the prince, when we consider the fact that the cobbler’s body now has all the memories of the prince and none of the mem- ories of the cobbler, we are not inclined to identify the individual as the same person as the cobbler. In the centuries since Locke’s time, similar hypothetical scenarios have often turned up in works of fiction and film, and our judgments about them seem generally to accord with Locke’s judgment about the prince and cobbler case.
