{"paragraph": " Rather, we seem to be attending to the experiences themselves. Relatedly, consider afterimages. If you stare at a picture of a green dot for about half a minute and then you shift your attention to a blank piece of white paper, you will visually experience a red dot on the paper similar in size and location to the green dot you had been staring at. Given that we don’t take there to be any red dot actually on the paper, it seems implausible to suppose that we attend to our afterimage experience by attending to the red dot. Another example often mentioned involves blurry experiences (see Pace 2007). Suppose you’re not wearing your glasses and you’re trying to read a text that just came through on your phone. You can see that it says “Home by 6 pm,” but it looks blurry to you. When you put your glasses on, the phenomenal character of your experience changes from blurry to clear (or, at least, clearer). But what’s represented by the ex- perience needn’t seem to change. The same words, “Home by 6 pm,” were represented both before and after you put your glasses on. Before you put your glasses on, you could attend to the blurriness of your experience without taking it to be a blurriness out there in the world. A different way of responding to the transparency thesis notes that it appears to be importantly ambiguous. As Amy Kind (2003) has ar- gued, we can distinguish two different interpretations of what it means to say that experience is transparent. When experience is strongly trans- parent, it is impossible to attend to the experience itself independent of what the experience represents. In contrast, when experience is weakly transparent, it is merely difficult to attend to the experience itself in- dependent of what the experience represents. But the fact that this task is difficult does not mean that it is impossible. With appropriate introspective effort, we can pull it off.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Is it impossible to attend to the experience itself independent of what the experience represents when experience is strongly transparent?", "answer": "Yes, when experience is strongly transparent, it is impossible to attend to the experience itself independent of what the experience represents.", "question_group_id": "32c9b781-ab79-49b6-a56d-1aeea54c8a16", "paragraph_idx": 14, "question_idx": 4}
