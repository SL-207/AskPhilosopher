{"paragraph": " Much more recently, a negative answer has been suggested by Project Prakash, documented by Held et al. (2011), in which five congenitally blind children had their sight restored. The children were unable to visually identify differently shaped Lego blocks they had previously known by touch. Though these empirical results seem to point to an unequivocal negative answer to Molyneux’s problem, they have been called into question by a number of critics. Those critics ar- gue, for example, that, because the visual systems of the patients aren’t immediately fully functioning, we cannot tell whether the failure is PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 188 due to the difference between visual and tactile representations of space or, more simply, the inadequacy of the patient’s visual system immediately after surgery (Toribio 2021).
