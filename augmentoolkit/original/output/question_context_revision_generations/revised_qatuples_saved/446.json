Dennett in a paper called “Quining Qualia.” The term “quining” is an homage to 20th-century philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine (1908–2000). Starting in 1969 and continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, Dennett published several editions of The Philosophical Lexicon, a humorous compilation of neologisms based on philosophers’ names. “Quining” (used as a verb) was the very first term he coined, and he defined it as follows: “to deny resolutely the existence or importance of something real or significant.” Indeed, the activity of quining was central to Quine’s philosophy.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the term \"quining\" based on?", "answer": "The term \"quining\" is based on the name of the 20th-century philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine.", "question_group_id": "1ace3eaa-c5e9-4703-b987-3612f03a2908", "paragraph_idx": 27, "question_idx": 0}
