{"paragraph": " In addition to extending transparency to non-visual perceptual ex- periences, Michael Tye has extended it even more broadly to all kinds of phenomenal experience whatsoever. Consider bodily sensations and emotions. On Tye’s view, when you have a toothache, if you try to attend to the pain your attention slips right through to the painful tooth itself. Likewise, when you’re scared of a giant rattlesnake coiled on the trail ahead of you, if you try to attend to your fear your attention slips right through to what you’re scared of; in this case, that’s the rattlesnake itself. How does the transparency thesis support representationalism? We might best see the representationalist as offering an argument that takes the form of an inference to the best explanation. Qualia are meant to be intrinsic features of experience. But if there really were such intrinsic features, features that were over and above functional and representational properties, then we should be able to attend to them. According to the representationalists, the fact that we can’t at- tend to any intrinsic properties of experience is best explained by the hypothesis that there are no intrinsic properties of experience. The phenomenal properties of an experience that have been presumed to be intrinsic properties are really just representational properties. In responding to this thought experiment, some philosophers deny that representationalists have described the Eloise case properly. In their view, we can introspectively attend to more than the representationalists think we can (e.g., Block 1996, Robinson 1998). To help defend this claim, they often point to kinds of experiences where there doesn’t really seem to be anything represented by the experience. For example, consider phosphene experiences—the kind of visual experience you have when you push (lightly!) on your eyeball. When you’re having a phosphene experience of a moving, colored expanse, the sensation doesn’t really seem to be suggesting that there are actually moving, Eloise and the Tree 113 colored expanses out there in the world somewhere; and so it seems implausible to say that, in attending to our phosphene experiences, our attention to slips through to the world.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the transparency thesis, and how does it relate to phenomenal experiences?", "answer": "The transparency thesis is the idea that, when you try to attend to a phenomenal experience, your attention slips right through to the external object or aspect of the world that is being experienced.
