{"paragraph": " If we take the test to be definitive, and thereby deny that the coffee is tasting any different to Sanborn from how it tasted in the past, then we would be overriding Sanborn’ own subjec- tive assessment of her qualia. After all, Sanborn insists that the coffee tastes different to her now. If we accept that she could be wrong about that, then it looks like she is no longer directly apprehending those qualia; if she were, says Dennett, then she would know what they are like. On the other hand, to check things with Chase, suppose that we subject him to a bunch of tests where he is asked to re-identify sam- ples of coffee, tea, and other beverages. If he does poorly at these tests, we might doubt his claim that the company’s coffee still tastes the same to him. Insofar as we’d be willing to override an individual’s own subjective assessments of their qualia, it again looks like we’re denying that qualitative experience is directly or immediately apprehensible to consciousness. Either way, it looks like we’re departing from our initial notion of qualia. As Dennett says (1988, p. 60), if we accept that individuals have to do tests or consult experts in order to confirm what qualia they’re having, then we’ve “surely” moved “far away from our original idea of qualia as properties with which we have a particularly intimate acquaintance.” Now let’s take this one step further. Suppose we try to explain why Chase’s qualia might be different from how they were before. A natural explanation would be to say that his shifting preferences have affected the way the coffee tastes to him—that is, that it’s precisely because his CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 52 preferences have changed that the taste has changed. Wine, for exam- ple, is often said to be an acquired taste. But what happens when you acquire that taste? One natural way to describe things would be to say that, as you come to appreciate certain aspects of the wine’s flavor, your qualitative experience changes.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "If an individual like Sanborn asserts that their qualia (i.e., the subjective experience of tasting coffee) have changed, but you were to override their subjective assessment by relying on a definitive test, would you be denying that they directly apprehend those qualia?", "answer": "Yes, by overriding their subjective assessment, I would be denying that they directly apprehend those qualia, because if they directly apprehended them, they would know what they are like.", "question_group_id": "3e9310c2-849c-4148-b4f0-0d4e2fe01439", "paragraph_idx": 46, "question_idx": 0}
