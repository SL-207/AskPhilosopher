{"paragraph": "” In the empirical literature, phenomena such as these are often treated as cases of “sympathetic magic” (Rozin et al. 1986). Let’s flesh out the details of the last example. Study participants saw an experimenter open a commercially labe- led box of sugar and pour some of it into two clean, empty bottles. They were then given two labels—one that said “sucrose” and one that said “sodium cyanide, poison”—and instructed to stick one to each bottle. The participants watched while water from the same source was poured into two glasses, and they also saw some powder from the bottle marked “poison” mixed into one glass and some powder from the bottle marked “sucrose” mixed into the other glass. Following all of this, participants were asked to rate how willing they were to take a sip from each glass, and the results showed a significant preference for the bottle that was labeled “sucrose”—even though participants acknowledged that they knew there was no poison in either glass, and that both glasses contained the same sugar water (Rozin et al. 1986). How do we account for these cases? It doesn’t look like an instance of contradictory beliefs. People at Skywalk don’t seem to have the The Skywalk 209 belief “It’s not safe” alongside their belief “It’s safe.” And it’s hard to see how people in the sugar water experiment would believe “There’s poison in this glass.” Do they merely imagine that Skywalk is unsafe or that there’s poison in the glass? The problem with this suggestion is that imaginings tend to be quarantined off from real-life belief and ac- tion. As Gendler puts it, imagination is like Las Vegas—what happens in imagination stays in imagination (2008b, p. 568). DISCUSSION In Gendler’s view, the best way to resolve the puzzle is to postulate the existence of a novel mental state—what she calls alief. Alief is a state that is associative, automatic, and arational. It is not reducible to belief or other mental states/attitudes.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What does the existence of alief imply?", "answer": "The existence of alief implies that there is a mental state that is separate from belief and other mental states/attitudes, and that is capable of influencing behavior and decision-making.", "question_group_id": "2b5229dd-dc8e-4768-b67a-60bfe4874baf", "paragraph_idx": 229, "question_idx": 4}
