{"paragraph": " (This is suggested but not exactly endorsed by Searle 1983, pp. 7–8. See also Platts 1979, pp. 256–7, Zangwill 1998.) Put in this crude way, something is clearly wrong: just because S desires p doesn’t always mean S should bring p about. Mark could want to murder his sister; but the existence of that desire doesn’t mean he should (Frost 2014)! Furthermore, does p’s simply being the case mean S should believe p? What if S has no evidence p is the case, or even has evidence against it? There are, of course, refinements of these views in light of such objections. But it is worth asking, what hangs on the issue? Aside from the hope of a theoretically satisfying distinction between beliefs and desires, some philosophers such as Smith think that the direction of fit analysis vindicates a Humean picture of motivation that sees the moti- vation to act as provided only by desires—you can believe giving your son a gift will make him happy; but, unless you have the desire to make him happy, you won’t be motivated to give him a gift. The direction of fit intuition potentially explains why beliefs are motivationally inert. If beliefs are only characterized by their ­disposition to reflect the world, getting information about the world will lead to a change of beliefs but never a motivation to change what they are about. It is desires, with their particular direction of fit, that lead ­subjects to change the world (Smith 1994, p. 116). However, that argument seems to assume that there are no states that are both belief-like, in that they are meant to represent the way the world is, and that have a motivational direc- tion of fit, in that they lead the subject to change the world to fit the belief. That assumption could be questioned. The belief that it is good to make children happy might be something that reflects a fact about the world but that also leads one to give gifts to children.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Can a belief be both about representing the world and motivating someone to change the world?", "answer": "Yes, it seems possible that a belief-like state could both reflect a fact about the world and lead someone to change the world.
