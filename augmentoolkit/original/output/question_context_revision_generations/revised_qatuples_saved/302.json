{"paragraph": " It can occur in the complete absence of any brain states, and, indeed, of any physical states altogether. If this is possible, then the particular pain under consideration cannot itself be a physical state. Contrary to what the physicalist claims, the pain is an irreducibly mental state. In saying that it is irreducible, Gertler means that it does not reduce to physical states. For comparison, consider a glass of water. Arguably, the water in that glass is nothing more than a collection of H2O molecules. In other words, the water reduces to H2O, and H2O itself reduces to bonded hydrogen and oxygen atoms. By contrast, ac- cording to Gertler, pain does not reduce to any physical state. DISCUSSION A related scenario has also been posed by W. D. Hart (1988); though, un- like Gertler, he does not focus on pain. Rather, he focuses on visualizing The Disembodied Pain 15 oneself disembodied (see also Chapter 1). Hart moves us slowly in im- agination from embodiment to disembodiment. You’re asked to im- agine waking up in your usual embodied state. Before you open your eyes, you carefully walk over to the mirror. In front of the mirror, when you raise your eyelids, you see empty eye sockets. You then peel back the top of your skull, and you can see that your entire skull is empty. There is no brain inside. As you stare into the mirror, the rest of your body slowly seems to melt away. By visualizing what you would see in the mirror once the entirety of your body has ­disappeared, you are able to conceive of yourself in a completely disembodied state. Again, on the assumption that whatever is conceivable is possible, we get to the conclusion that physicalism must be false and that dualism must be true. Arguments that rely on this assumption—that whatever is ­conceivable is possible—are often referred to as conceivability ­arguments. Many arguments concerning the mind–body problem and the ­nature of consciousness take this basic form: that is, they begin with a claim about what is conceivable and move to a claim about what is ­possible.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Can pain occur in the complete absence of any physical states, and if so, what does this imply about the nature of pain?", "answer": "Yes, pain can occur in the complete absence of any physical states.
