{"paragraph": " The inversion issue could be raised for any sense modality, at least in principle. For example, one might ­wonder whether inverted gustatory qualia are possible. But inverted visual qualia are the most commonly discussed kind. Inverted qualia cases raise epistemological questions. For ­example, how do you know your own qualia are not inverted? Such cases have also been used to challenge functionalism, physicalism, and ­representationalism. To see why such cases threaten functionalism, let us add an additional claim to the above description of Invert: ­suppose Invert is not functionally atypical. That does not seem especially ­difficult to imagine. Suppose her red/green experiences have always been inverted. If so, then she might well behave similarly to people Inverted Qualia 117 whose color experiences are not inverted. Indeed, it seems she might be similar to those people in all relevant functional respects. The anomaly might never be detected, either by her or by others. For example, because we learn words for colors by example, Invert describes blood as being red and grass as being green, just as Non-vert does. But if Invert is not functionally atypical, then it is hard to see how color qualia could be just functional properties. Your “red” experiences are phenomenally different from those of others; the qualia differ. And yet, functionally, your “red” experiences are the same as those of others, or so we are imagining. Inverted qualia cases have also been used to challenge physical- ism. This time, suppose Invert is not physically atypical. For example, suppose that, in humans, phenomenally red experience is correlated 1-to-1 with a certain brain state B1, and phenomenally green experi- ence is correlated 1-to-1 with a different brain state B2. Now imagine that, just like Non-vert, when Invert sees blood, her brain goes into B1. Imagine also that, just like Non-vert, when Invert sees grass, her brain goes into state B2.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What type of qualia are commonly discussed in relation to the inversion issue?", "answer": "Inverted visual qualia are the most commonly discussed type.", "question_group_id": "e1027777-a1ed-492a-9792-441c8adbe86a", "paragraph_idx": 41, "question_idx": 0}
