{"paragraph": " To understand how such a challenge arises, it will be useful to consider how philosophers differentiate mental states and attitudes from one another. Take a claim like “There are some brownies in the kitchen.” It’s possible for us to take many different mental at- titudes towards that same content. We might believe that there are 34 The Skywalk 207 some brownies in the kitchen, hope that there are some brownies in the kitchen, fear that there are some brownies in the kitchen, and so on. When trying to explain the difference between these various attitudes, philosophers of mind tend to rely heavily on their different functional profiles. Believing that there are brownies in the kitchen will bring about different behavior from that brought about by fear- ing that there are brownies in the kitchen; and it also has different connections to other mental states. Occasionally, cases arise in which we see a person behaving in ways that don’t match the expected func- tional profile of the mental states that we would typically see them as having. How should such cases be accounted for? Though sometimes we might be able to account for the behavior by reassessing which beliefs and desires (and other traditionally recognized mental states) the person has, sometimes this does not seem adequate. Faced with that inadequacy, another option would be to explore the addition of a new mental state category to our traditional taxonomy. THE CASE At the west rim of the Grand Canyon, on the Hualapai Reservation in Peach Springs, Arizona, is a remarkable glass bridge that was erected in 2007. This bridge, the Grand Canyon Skywalk, consists of more than 1 million pounds of steel and 83,000 points of glass, and in total it weighs 1.2 million pounds. Its foundation is strong enough to support approximately 71 million pounds. At 4000 feet high, Skywalk is more than twice as tall as New York’s One World Trade Center and Taipei 101 in Taiwan, and considerably taller than the 2717-foot Burj Khalifa in Dubai, currently the world’s tallest building.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Can you think of a scenario in which a person's behavior doesn't match the expected functional profile of their mental states? How might this scenario be explained?", "answer": "Yes, I can think of a scenario in which a person's behavior doesn't match the expected functional profile of their mental states. For example, imagine a person who claims to believe that a certain action is necessary, but consistently fails to take the action. This behavior might not match the expected functional profile of their mental state, and could be explained by reassessing which beliefs and desires they actually have, or by exploring the addition of a new mental state category to our traditional taxonomy.", "question_group_id": "ae3ce6ee-05ff-4f9e-9074-249df2e5e256", "paragraph_idx": 213, "question_idx": 4}
