There are many unsolved prob- lems associated with consciousness—such as explaining why humans dream or determining exactly how anesthesia works. But as hard as these problems might be, they seem comparatively easy when com- pared with the problem of explaining why a given neural process has or gives rise to the particular experiential quality that it does.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the relationship between the hard problem of consciousness and the concept of qualia?", "answer": "The hard problem of consciousness is closely related to the concept of qualia, as it is concerned with explaining why a given neural process has or gives rise to the particular experiential quality that it does. In other words, the hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining the nature of qualia.", "question_group_id": "8836fa4c-4f38-4158-9b93-008651b21d75", "paragraph_idx": 66, "question_idx": 3}
