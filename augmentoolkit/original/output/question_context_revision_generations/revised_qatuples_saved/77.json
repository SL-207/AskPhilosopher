{"paragraph": " That, in a nutshell, is the hard problem of consciousness. Standard methods in cognitive science can explain many features associated with consciousness. For example, consider reportability—the ability to produce verbal reports about one’s inner states. Here the feature we want to explain is a cognitive ability, or the performance of a cognitive function. That is something the standard methods of cog- nitive science are especially good at: working out the ­computational and/or neural mechanisms that underlie the performance of cognitive functions (or the exercise of an ability). Once such mechanisms have been sufficiently detailed, there is nothing left to explain. When that is the case, we could describe a feature as being functionally ­definable. And the problem of explaining functionally definable features is what Chalmers calls an “easy” problem. The same explanatory model ­applies to almost all other features associated with the term “con- sciousness”—such as being awake rather than asleep and being able to focus one’s attention on one’s holey socks. CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 20 But there is a glaring exception: experience itself—that is, the ­what-it’s-like aspect of consciousness. Here, the problem isn’t about explaining the performance of a cognitive function. It’s about why there’s any experience there all. Suppose we have explained the per- formance of any cognitive function associated with consciousness. The question remains: why is the performance of that function ac- companied by experience? And why the particular sort of experience that accompanies that performance, rather than one with a distinct experiential character? There would seem to be what Joseph Levine (1983) calls an explanatory gap between the performance of functions and experience. To bridge that gap, we will need more materials than the standard methods of cognitive science supply.
