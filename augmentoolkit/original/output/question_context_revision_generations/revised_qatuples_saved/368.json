DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-18 MAD PAIN AND MARTIAN PAIN BACKGROUND Two popular versions of physicalism are known as the identity theory and functionalism. According to the identity theory, mental phenomena are identical to physical phenomena. For example, pain is identical to certain brain processes, such as c-fiber stimulation, in much the same way that lightning is identical to electrical discharge and wa- ter is identical to H2O.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is an analogy provided to illustrate the identity theory?", "answer": "The text provides an analogy to illustrate the identity theory, comparing pain to c-fiber stimulation, just as lightning is compared to electrical discharge and water is compared to H2O.", "question_group_id": "44d12b7f-f7dd-4007-b458-375dda0c5b65", "paragraph_idx": 56, "question_idx": 2}
