{"paragraph": " A twist on this strategy holds that there is more than one dimension of content, and so, in effect, Pierre’s belief can’t be fully captured by a single proposition. Pierre does believe two incompatible proposi- tions: London is pretty and London is not pretty. There is, however, another layer of content that captures the significance of the belief for Pierre, just as it was suggested above. This is ultimately a version of the Fregean strategy in that it provides a level of content that includes something like a term’s sense and another that includes its referent. Which of the two dimensions of content we employ when we ascribe beliefs—that is, when we say such things as “Pierre believes London is pretty,” or “Pierre believes London is not pretty,” or “Pierre believes London is pretty and he believes that it’s not pretty”—will depend in part on context. If we want to highlight the city he is thinking about, we will be inclined to ascribe the referential content; but when we want to highlight the way in which he is thinking about these cities, we will ascribe the content more closely aligned with a “sense” (Stal- naker 1987, Crimmins and Perry 1989, Chalmers 2002).
