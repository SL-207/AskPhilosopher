{"paragraph": " The value of the special sciences is epistemological, in the sense that they help us comprehend events that would be hard to understand in the language of physics. But for many, such as Jerry Fodor in “Special Sciences” (1974), this concessive reaction is incorrect. According to Fodor, it underestimates the sense in which sciences such as psychology really do discover new laws—interesting, predictively important, and coun- terfactually robust generalizations—that are not present in the laws of physics. Just as important, the special sciences discover unified types of phenomena that relate to each other in a lawlike manner. Though Fodor’s main concern is psychology, a consideration of economics makes things particularly plain. Consider the law that, other things being equal, prices are higher if there is more money in the economy. If this is true, it’s not because of the physical stuff money is made of. Bits of currency can be made of paper, coins, or entries in electronic ledgers, all of which have dramatically different physical properties. The law of economics holds despite the diversity of these physical properties. While no law of physics is ever broken in economic transactions, the laws of economics are independent of physical laws. Someone who could see only physical properties and ­interactions probably wouldn’t even know there was an economy, much less understand why prices were suddenly high! The same thing is true of the laws of psychology. Beliefs and ­desires can be made of different physical things. In extreme cases, perhaps between androids and humans, some beliefs could be ­carbon based and others silicon based. But even among animals there is certainly no guarantee—or need for a guarantee—that the same neural or ­subatomic activity is going on in two creatures with the same ­beliefs. Nevertheless, it is all-things-considered true that if an organism ­believes it is in danger and desires to get out of danger, it will try to do so.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "How do the special sciences, such as psychology, contribute to our understanding of the world?", "answer": "The special sciences help us comprehend events that would be hard to understand in the language of physics.
