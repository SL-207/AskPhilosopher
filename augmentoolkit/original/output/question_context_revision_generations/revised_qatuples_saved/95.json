{"paragraph": " Such 28 CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 174 senses can be expressed using definite descriptions. Perhaps Hesperus has the sense “the heavenly body that appears in the evening” and Phosphorous has the sense “the heavenly body that appears first in the morning.” Millians deny this, and therefore need a response to Frege’s anti-Millian argument. Kripke (1979) provides one, based on his puzzle about belief. THE CASE Consider a Frenchman named Pierre who, growing up in rural France, knows no English. He has seen nice postcards of the capital of England, and so readily and sincerely assents to the sentence “Londres est jolie.” Whatever we might think of his evidence, it seems clear that Pierre believes London is pretty. That’s just what the French sentence means: he speaks French fluently, and he assents to it. A little later in life, Pierre moves to an unattractive part of London. While there, he picks up English from those around him (rather than by transla- tion) and, naturally enough, comes to know that the English call this city “London.” Because he never leaves his bad neighborhood, Pierre comes to sincerely assent to the sentence “London is not pretty.” It seems clear that Pierre believes London is not pretty. That’s just what the sentence means: he speaks English fluently, and he assents to it. Nevertheless, and here’s the twist, Pierre never realizes the city in the postcard was the city he lives in now. He still unhesitatingly assents to the sentence “Londres est jolie.” The belief expressed by that sentence didn’t change. But now we have a puzzle. Pierre, who is perfectly ra- tional, seems to believe at one and the same time that London is pretty and that London is not pretty. Pierre seems to be in the same position as Caroline: we seem forced to describe him as having contradictory beliefs, even though he is not irrational. But this time rejecting the Millian principle doesn’t help, since the puzzle doesn’t depend on the claim that co-referential names can be substituted for one another.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Can a person have conflicting senses or meanings for a word, even if they use the word consistently?", "answer": "Yes, a person can have conflicting senses or meanings for a word, even if they use the word consistently.
