{"paragraph": " For example, consider Jones’s belief that grass is green. Her belief is about grass and about being green. It also represents a proposition: the prop- osition that grass is green. That proposition is the representational content of her belief, in that her belief is true if and only if grass is, in fact, green. Why do mental states have the representational content they have? Why do they have representational content at all? This can seem mysterious, especially from a naturalistic perspective on which mental states are parts of the natural, physical world. For example, considered as a physical object, a photograph is nothing more than an arrangement of molecules, and molecules do not appear to be about anything. And, from a naturalistic perspective, the same would seem to be true of mental states. Teleological theories of content aim to ­dispel that mystery by showing how mental content derives from non-­ mental aspects of nature. According to such theories, mental content depends at least partly on functions of the things (or systems) that use or produce those contents. And such functions are usually understood in terms of natural selection (or a related process), roughly as what 24 Swampman 147 the thing in question was selected for. A classic source for this sort of view is Ruth Millikan’s Language, Thought and Other Biological Cate- gories (1984). One consequence of Millikan’s view is that a subject’s mental content depends on their evolutionary history. But what if a creature has no evolutionary history? Could it have mental contents? If so, how? And what would determine which contents they have? THE CASE Donald is an ordinary human being. Or rather, he was until one fate- ful day, when he was visiting a swamp that was struck by lightning. The lightning simultaneously caused two things to happen. It vapor- ized Donald’s body and it transformed a nearby dead tree into an ex- act replica of him, known as Swampman.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is one way that mental content can be explained?", "answer": "One way to explain mental content is through teleological theories, which show how mental content derives from non-mental aspects of nature.
