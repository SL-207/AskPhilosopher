{"paragraph": " Or at least the difference would not be even partly based, as it plainly is, on psychological facts about the person you observed saying “Gav- agai!” and other native speakers of the language you’re studying. Quine (1969) recognizes that such consequences of his doctrine can seem absurd, especially when one applies it to one’s own words. In response to that sort of worry, he appeals to another doctrine: the rela- tivity of meaning and reference. In physics, a particle has a position and a velocity not in any absolute sense but only relative to a coordinate system. In Quine’s view, the same is true of meaning and reference. As he puts it, “Reference is nonsense except relative to a coordinate system” (1969, p. 47), where a “coordinate system” is provided by a specific language, such as English. But does that analogy address the worry? In physics, the position and velocity of a particle consists en- tirely in its relations to a coordinate system. By contrast, there seems to be more to meaning than just the relations a term has to the language of which it is a part. Of course, which particular meaning a word has is relative to a language. For example, the word “gift” means present relative to English, but it means poison relative to German. Likewise, “rabbit” means rabbit only relative to English. But meaning itself does not seem to be language-dependent. When we ask whether there is a translation of “rabbit” into some other language, we are asking pre- cisely whether there is a term in that other language with the same (language-independent) meaning. Is rejecting behaviorism enough to undermine the case for Quine’s indeterminacy doctrine? Many philosophers who reject behaviorism accept that doctrine, or something close to it. A prominent example is Donald Davidson. Although Davidson rejects behaviorism about men- tal states, he maintains a related view about semantics—that is, linguistic meaning.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "How does Quine's doctrine lead to seemingly absurd consequences, and what is his response to these worries?", "answer": "Quine's doctrine leads to seemingly absurd consequences when one applies it to one's own words, suggesting that the meaning of those words is relative to a specific language and cannot be understood in an absolute sense.
