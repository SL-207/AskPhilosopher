DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-22 ELOISE AND THE TREE BACKGROUND Many of our mental states have intentional content. Intentionality in the relevant sense doesn’t have to do with having an intention or doing something intentionally, but rather with representational content. The notion is often characterized in terms of “aboutness” or “directedness.” For example, my belief that Mike Trout plays for the Los Angeles Angels is about a particular person, Mike Trout, and a certain state of affairs—his playing for that particular baseball team. My belief represents, or is directed at, those things.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the main difference between having an intention and having intentional content?", "answer": "According to the text, having an intention and having intentional content are not the same thing.
