{"paragraph": " Chapter 29 attempts to get at this contrast by considering two sorts of list. On the one hand, there is a shopping list where the purpose of the list is to get the world—or rather the shopping basket—to reflect what is on the list. On the other hand, there is a receipt, which should be a list that matches what is in the basket. DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-27 RABBITS AND RABBIT STAGES BACKGROUND Sometimes what we say is ambiguous. When I tell you that I’ve gone to the bank, you might wonder whether I went to a financial insti- tution or to a river. Also, some ordinary terms are vague, e.g., “tall” and “bald.” Even so, often what we say would seem to have deter- minate meaning. For example, suppose I say of my friend Smith, “Smith is tall.” Here “Smith” refers to my friend, even though there are many others who go by the name “Smith.” Also, here “is tall” refers to the property of being tall, even if there is no precise mini- mal height required for being tall. Such claims might seem obviously true—perhaps too obvious to bother stating. Not according to Wil- lard Van Orman Quine. According to Quine, such claims are actually false. In his view, understanding linguistic meaning requires analyzing language from an objective, scientific viewpoint. And that, he holds, involves setting aside our pre-theoretical intuitions about meaning and instead focusing only on objective facts. For example, in the case of translating unknown languages into one’s own language, those ob- jective facts include only dispositions to exhibit verbal behavior in response to external stimuli. As Quine (1987, p. 5) writes: “There is nothing in linguistic meaning … beyond what is to be gleaned from 23 CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 140 overt behavior in observable circumstances.” The results of Quine’s influential analysis are startling. Contrary to what might have seemed obvious, what we say generally lacks determinate meaning.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What does Quine say about the meaning of language?", "answer": "According to Quine, the meaning of language is not determined by our subjective intuitions or pre-theoretical understanding, but rather by objective facts that can be observed and studied from a scientific viewpoint.", "question_group_id": "f674dfe6-948e-4400-a1c3-7b66f2f7737b", "paragraph_idx": 197, "question_idx": 2}
