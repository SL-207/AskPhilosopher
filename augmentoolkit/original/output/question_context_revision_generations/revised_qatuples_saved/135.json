{"paragraph": " Someone studying only physics would predict all of the movements of the subatomic activity that underlies the organism’s behavior—its attempt to get out of danger. But they would miss what causes that behavior, and would probably fail to understand that there was behavior—as opposed to mere physical motions—in the first place. The Puzzle of the Special Sciences 79 Although psychology neither talks about anything non-physical nor contravenes the laws of physics, it is an autonomous science all the same. Some (such as Fodor himself, and many of the non-reductive materialists mentioned in the previous chapter) draw a moral for the philosophy of mind: mental states are physical states, but they are not identical to those states (and cannot be reduced to them) because they are governed by distinct laws. DISCUSSION Probably the most influential counterpoint to Fodor’s picture of the special sciences comes from Jaegwon Kim (1992). Kim finds some- thing suspicious about Fodor’s story in “Special Sciences.” The story, in Kim’s view, depends on claiming that there is a law in the ­special sciences but no corresponding law in the physical sciences. Kim ­questions this assumption: Why not take the special-sciences law to be a law in physical science? Staying with the economics analogy, Fodor’s answer might seem obvious: units of currency are not physical kinds like quarks, charge, mass, etc. But that seemingly obvious answer itself raises questions. Granted, any particular instance of currency is realized by something physical (paper, copper, electrons, etc.), but the kind itself is not physical. One might wonder, though, why there can’t be a disjunctive kind: “P1 or P2 or P3 or P4”—where P1 is the physical basis of paper money, P2 of copper money, P3 of digital currency, and so on? Though it’s a disjunctive kind, it involves only physical terms. So, why isn’t it a physical kind that can be included in physical laws?", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the problem with considering the special-sciences law to be a law in physical science?", "answer": "The problem is that this would imply that the special-sciences law is a physical kind that can be included in physical laws, which would undermine the idea that the special sciences are autonomous and operate independently of the physical sciences.", "question_group_id": "2fbd40a5-ea75-489e-bbca-518d43c1a5d2", "paragraph_idx": 3, "question_idx": 4}
