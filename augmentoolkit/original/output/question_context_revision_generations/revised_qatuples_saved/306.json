{"paragraph": " In those imagined communities, pain is less closely related to the behavioral responses that we associate with pain. Now imagine creatures that feel pain but whose pain is not caused in the way ours typically is—for example, when our bodies are damaged. Instead, they feel pain only when a certain sort of magnetic field is present—a field that does not damage their bodies. Such creatures might also be super-spartans, in which case their pain experiences are accompanied by neither the causes nor the effects that normally accompany human pain. Perhaps those super-spartans nonetheless report having pain when they have it. That is potentially significant because some behavio- rists accord a central role to verbal expressions of mental states. That ­inspired Putnam’s final variation on his thought experiment: the ­super-super-spartans (he also calls them “X-worlders”), who do not even report having pain when they have pain. Individual members of that community might have their own private way of thinking about pain, and they might well dislike pain just as we do. But, publicly, they are silent about it. The super-super-spartans feel pain but have none of the dispositions we normally associate with pain. Putnam concludes that behaviorism is false. His argument could be summarized as follows. If behaviorism is true, then experiencing PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 84 pain consists in having the dispositional states normally associated with pain (wincing, etc.). If experiencing pain consists in having those ­dispositional states, then it’s impossible that any creatures experience pain unless their pain is accompanied by those dispositional states. The super-super-spartans case demonstrates that such creatures are ­possible. Therefore, behaviorism is false. DISCUSSION Putnam’s super-spartans case premiered in his 1963 article “Brains and Behavior.” By that time, methodological behaviorism was ­being supplanted by cognitivist approaches in psychology, which focuses as much on inner, mental representational states as on their ­behavioral causes and effects.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the conclusion that Putnam draws from the super-super-spartans case, and what is his argument against behaviorism?", "answer": "Putnam concludes that behaviorism is false.
