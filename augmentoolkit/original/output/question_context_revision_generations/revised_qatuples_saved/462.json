{"paragraph": " The introductory geom- etry student who learns that a right triangle is a three-sided closed figure with one 90-degree angle needs to learn more before their concept of right triangle will be of use in conceivability arguments, as they don’t yet understand what other properties go along with a fig- ure’s having a right angle. Their concept is still incomplete. But now consider a simple and straightforward concept like bachelor. Once you know that the definition of “bachelor” is “unmarried man of eligible ­marrying age,” that’s all you need to know for your concept to be clear and complete—that is, to be sufficiently comprehensive for use in ­conceivability arguments. Given that Gertler requires that a concept must be sufficiently comprehensive for it to be of use in conceivability arguments, her thought experiment will succeed in supporting dualism only if our concept of pain is sufficiently comprehensive. To defend this assertion about our concept of pain, Gertler contrasts the concept of pain with the concept of water. Someone might know how water feels and tastes, while being ignorant of its chemical composition. They might not know that water is H2O. As Gertler puts the point, water has a hidden essence. This essence can be discovered only by way of scientific investigation. On her view, pain is unlike water in this respect: “Pain wears its essential nature on its sleeve, as it were” (Gertler 2007: 40). Because we conceptualize pain in terms of the way it feels—or, as it’s often put, in terms of its phenomenology—it lacks a hidden essence. Though we do not come to know the essence of water in virtue of feeling it, we do come to know the essence of pain in virtue of feeling it. Thus, in Gertler’s view, our concept of pain is sufficiently comprehensive to be used in an argument that moves from conceiv- ability to possibility.
