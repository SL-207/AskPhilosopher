{"paragraph": " Sally could desire that her mother send money. What makes one state a belief and the other a desire? Can anything general be said about the difference, beyond simply repeat- ing that one is a belief and the other is a desire? Elizabeth Anscombe (1957) suggests (or at least has been taken to suggest) that a key dif- ference is what she calls “direction of fit.” Her famous case of the shopping list illustrates this concept. THE CASE Imagine a man walking through a grocery store with a shopping list. The list says: cheese, bread, chocolate, grapes …. Following him is a detective who writes her own list, based on what the man bought. Her list says: cheese, bread, chocolate, grapes …. These lists are in some sense exactly the same—they name the same items. But they also 29 The Shopping List 179 differ. The shopper’s list guides the shopper’s actions—to make the list accurate, he must fill his cart with the listed items. The items should match the list. The detective’s list, on the other hand, is meant to re- flect what the shopper bought. The list should match the items. So, suppose that the man gets home and finds that instead of grapes he bought grappa. The shopper can’t fix his mistake by crossing “grapes” off the list and replacing it with “grappa.” This would miss the point of the list—to fix the mistake he needs to go back and trade the grappa for the grapes. If the detective, on the other hand, has “grapes” on her list when the man bought grappa, she can fix the mistake by correcting her list. The point can be glossed by the idea that the lists have different directions of fit. The detective’s list has to fit the way the world turns out to be. The shopper has to make the world fit the list. ­Anscombe’s suggestion, then, is that mental states differ in the same way as the lists. Beliefs are like the detective’s list: they aim at match- ing the way the world is. Desires are like the shopper’s list: they aim at making the world match the agent’s representation of it.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "According to Anscombe, what happens when you try to correct a desire by changing the world to match the list, rather than changing the list to match the world?", "answer": "If you tried to correct a desire by changing the world to match the list, rather than changing the list to match the world, you would be acting in a way that is not consistent with the nature of desires. In the example of the shopping list, if the shopper tried to correct their desire by crossing \"grapes\" off the list and replacing it with \"grappa\", they would be missing the point of the list, which is to make the world match the list. Instead, they should go back and trade the grappa for the grapes to make the world match the list.", "question_group_id": "69addeb6-48de-4cd5-8adb-6374fab5950e", "paragraph_idx": 12, "question_idx": 3}
