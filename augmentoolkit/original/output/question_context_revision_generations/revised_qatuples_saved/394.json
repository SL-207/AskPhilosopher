{"paragraph": " And on and on this goes. After you’ve been in the room a while, you find yourself becoming more and skilled in using the rulebook. You still have no idea what any of the characters mean, or what the point of this whole enterprise is, but you get extremely fast at your task. You can almost instantly locate the relevant rule and pass out the relevant piece of paper. But now suppose that it turns out that the characters inscribed on the pieces of paper and in the rulebook are all actually characters in Mandarin. (If you are a Mandarin-speaker, or can recognize Mandarin characters, then substitute a different language with characters that you wouldn’t recognize—perhaps Arabic or Greek or Sanskrit.) From the perspective of the person outside the room who has been slipping in the pieces of paper, it seems that they have been having a conver- sation with someone who is fluent in Mandarin—a conversation that has ranged across a great variety of subjects. This scenario presents a thought experiment proposed by John Searle and commonly referred to as the Chinese Room. According to Searle, while in the room you are equivalent to a computer running a program—and, indeed, the best possible program for understand- ing Mandarin there could be. Your program is so good that you have fooled someone into thinking you speak Mandarin. You have passed the Turing Test for Mandarin (see Chapter 17). But you don’t speak Mandarin. You don’t understand what the characters mean, and you PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 106 can’t come to understand them in virtue of the program that you are running. In Searle’s view, this shows that no computer can come to achieve understanding in virtue of running a symbolic program con- sisting of syntactically specified rules. As he often puts the point, syntax is not sufficient for semantics. His argument runs roughly as follows: 1.
