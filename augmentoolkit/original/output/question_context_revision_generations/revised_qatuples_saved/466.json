{"paragraph": " Instead, this puzzle seems to depend on independently plausible and less contentious claims. One is a simple fact about translation: “London is pretty” is a translation of “Londres est jolie,” and so those sentences express the same propo- sition. The other is an unobjectionable view about belief ascription: when a subject assents to a sentence “S” and understands what “S” Puzzling Pierre 175 means—namely S—then the subject believes S. It seems we often use these principles implicitly. Suppose John, an English-speaker, sincerely assents to the sentence “London is pretty.” It looks like we should say John believes London is pretty. Suppose Jacques, a French-speaker, sincerely asserts to the sentence “Londres est jolie.” It seems we should say Jacques also believes London is pretty. Following the same sorts of principles in the Pierre case leads to the puzzling fact that Pierre be- lieves both that London is pretty and that London is not pretty. There are at least two lessons we can take from Kripke’s example. First, it’s a puzzle: what exactly does Pierre believe? Something seems to have gone wrong here; but what? Second, since it seems puzzles of this sort can be generated without the Millian principle; we might think again about our inclination to reject that principle because of Hespe- rus/Phosphorus cases: they appear to be very similar to the Londres/ London cases, after all, which don’t depend on the Millian principle. If the puzzle raises a general problem for belief ascription, it’s not clear the Millian principle is to blame in Hesperus/Phosphorus cases after all. DISCUSSION Although the literature on Kripke’s puzzle is voluminous and the solu- tions often technical, responses to his puzzle fall into two general camps. In the first camp are those who tend to accept that Pierre, while ra- tional, has contradictory beliefs: he believes London is pretty and he believes London is not pretty.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is a principle about translation that is used in the example of Pierre?", "answer": "The principle states that when a subject assents to a sentence \"S\" and understands what \"S\" means, then the subject believes S.", "question_group_id": "36460f2a-ccc5-4b28-9f4c-bee1f2187caf", "paragraph_idx": 220, "question_idx": 1}
