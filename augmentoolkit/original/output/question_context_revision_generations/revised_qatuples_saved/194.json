{"paragraph": ") Some argue that the same is true of the zombie scenario: enough reflection would reveal that the zombie scenario is incoherent (see Chapter 32). On one version of that objection, the reason zombies seem con- ceivable is that we don’t yet know enough about what a zombie world would be like (Stoljar 2006). Such a world would be exactly like the actual world in all physical respects. But how can we claim to know what that entails? The physical sciences aren’t completed. There is much about the physical world we don’t know. Perhaps future discoveries in physics will reveal some inconsistency in the idea of a physical/functional duplicate of the actual world without Zombies 41 consciousness—discoveries that would prove that any such physi- cal/functional duplicate would have to contain consciousness. If we can’t see that inconsistency today, that might be because current physics is incomplete. In response, proponents of the zombie argu- ment argue that any future discovery in physics could only reveal information of the same kind that current physics reveals—namely, information about causal, spacetime structure. In their view, no rev- elation of that sort would undermine, or even weaken, the intuition that a zombie world is conceivable (see Chapter 4; Chalmers 2003, Alter 2023). Another physicalist response to the zombie argument is to deny its second premise: the claim that the ideal conceivability of a zombie world entails that it is metaphysically possible. Here, one might in- voke an analogy to hydrogen-free water. Many philosophers regard such a thing as metaphysically impossible, on the grounds that water is H2O. But suppose you don’t know anything about the chemical composition of water. You might nevertheless well understand the concept of water. Plausibly, many people had that concept well before the chemical composition of water was discovered. So, suppose you are in that sort of position: you know what water is in an everyday sense, but you don’t know that it’s really H2O.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What does it mean for a concept to be \"metaphysically possible\", and how does this relate to the zombie argument?", "answer": "For a concept to be \"metaphysically possible\" means that it is possible for it to exist in reality, regardless of whether we can imagine it or not.
