{"paragraph": " We see things in our visual field only when we attend to them. Otherwise, they’re only potentially seen. DISCUSSION Does change blindness (or inattentional blindness) really show that perceptual experience is sparse? Some think so (Blackmore et al. 1995, Rensink et al. 1997, Simons 1997, O’Regan and Noë 2001, Tye 2009). But others do not (Dretske 2007, Block 2007, 2012). How can we decide? Some issues can be resolved empirically. For example, consider experimental results such as the following (Fernandez-Duque and Thornton 2000). Subjects are first shown pairs of pictures that look identical to them (in the way drawings A and B look to you at first). Then they do a forced-choice task of selecting those pairs where there is a change. In other words, they are told to choose which pairs aren’t identical, even though they say all pairs look identical. They success- fully identify the non-identical pairs at above-chance levels. This indi- cates that it’s probably incorrect to say that your visual system doesn’t register or represent the things in the visual that you don’t notice. And Change Blindness 227 so it’s probably misleading to say, without qualification, that you’re literally blind to those things—that, for example, Sarah doesn’t visually perceive Sam in any sense. But that doesn’t settle the issue of whether Sarah consciously perceives Sam. It’s consistent with the results of the forced-choice experiments that Sarah perceives Sam unconsciously, and that to see him consciously would require her focusing attention on him—at least enough for her to ask “Who (or what) is that?” Michael Tye defends that position. In his view, consciously seeing is less like taking a photograph than like draw- ing a picture. He writes: “At a conscious level, a constructive process operates that is something like drawing a picture. … It is not like taking a clear, color photograph. It leaves things out” (2009, p.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the difference between visually perceiving something and consciously perceiving it?", "answer": "Visually perceiving something may not necessarily mean that you consciously perceive it.
