{"paragraph": " To support that conclusion, David Chalmers considers some ­theories of consciousness that scientists have developed. One is ­Bernard Baars’ (1988) global workspace theory of consciousness. In this theory, the cognitive system that our brains realize includes a sort of central ­processor—a global workspace that mediates commu- nication between more specialized processors. Baars uses the model to explain contrasts between conscious and unconscious cognitive functions: information in the global workspace is conscious, while other information is not. Baars’ theory is controversial. But, even if his theory is true, the hard problem isn’t solved. The hard prob- lem isn’t about explaining cognitive functions. One might suppose that all and only conscious experiences (in the relevant what-it’s- like sense) are contents of the global workspace. But the question remains: why are those contents experienced at all? Similar things can be said about other scientific theories of consciousness, such as the theory that certain 35–75 hertz neural oscillations in the cerebral cortex are the basis of consciousness (Crick and Koch 1990). Indeed, some such theories aim only to account for the neural correlates of consciousness—the neural processes that accompany all and only conscious experiences. And correlation is not explanation. (Perhaps red cars are more likely to be involved in accidents than non-red cars; that is, perhaps there is a correlation between being a red car and be- ing especially likely to get in an accident. The question remains: why is there that correlation?) The Hard Problem of Consciousness 21 The hard problem concerns scientific explanation. But it gives rise to a challenge to physicalism—the philosophical theory on which no aspect of the mind is over and above the physical. The challenge could be stated roughly as follows. The explanatory gap indicates that con- sciousness is independent of physical phenomena.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the main difference between the global workspace theory of consciousness and unconscious cognitive functions, according to Bernard Baars' theory?", "answer": "According to Bernard Baars' theory, the main difference between the global workspace theory of consciousness and unconscious cognitive functions is that information in the global workspace is conscious, while other information is not.", "question_group_id": "b273a874-9b48-4846-9e13-d90ae90821b8", "paragraph_idx": 55, "question_idx": 0}
