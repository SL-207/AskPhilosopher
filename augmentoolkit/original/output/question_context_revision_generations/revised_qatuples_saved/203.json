{"paragraph": " The Matrix can therefore be seen as a skeptical scenario which threatens our knowledge of even the most mundane facts. If I’m in the Matrix, I’m not wearing shoes. So, since I can’t know I’m not in the Matrix, I can’t know I’m wearing shoes, etc. But is the world in the Matrix an illusion? When Neo is in the Matrix and sits at his virtual desk in front of a virtual computer, is his belief that he is sitting at his desk false? David J. Chalmers (2005, 2022) thinks not. Tables and chairs exist in the Matrix. It’s just that the underlying metaphysics is not exactly how we suppose it is. As a mat- ter of fact, the underlying physics of the actual world is far from what we might suppose it is—it involves quantum particles, and perhaps even vibrations of multi-dimensional strings. This is very different than the idea that tables and chairs are made up of solid little pieces of tables and chairs. If the “bottom-level” story about tables and chairs is weirder than we realize, involving vibrating strings, are there no tables and chairs? Have we been wrong all along that there are such things? No, there are tables and chairs; they are just made of different stuff than we probably thought they were. The same is true, says Chalmers, of the Matrix. Under that scenario, everything we see, even the nature of spacetime, is a matter of computational processes. Desks are still desks—they are solid, are in spacetime, and are made of wood. It’s only that the underlying basis of their solidity—the nature of the spacetime they occupy and the nature of wood itself—is ultimately different than it seems to be in the non-Matrix world. Chalmers’ argument is unlike Putnam’s in that it doesn’t use the causal theory of reference to argue that a skeptical scenario is self-­ defeating. Nevertheless, Chalmers’ argument suggests important lessons about reference, mental content, and perception. To see this, suppose that the robotic overlords of the Matrix allow a couple of ­humans, Dave and Dan, to be raised outside the machine as pod-­ custodians, cleaning up leaky goo and fixing loose wires.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "How does Chalmers respond to the idea that the world in the Matrix is an illusion?", "answer": "Chalmers argues that the world in the Matrix is not an illusion, but rather a reality that exists in a different form. According to Chalmers, tables and chairs still exist, but their underlying nature is different from what we assume. For example, the desk may still be a desk, but it is made of computational processes rather than solid wood.", "question_group_id": "4c694959-ce1f-44f7-bdf3-3372900cc006", "paragraph_idx": 190, "question_idx": 2}
