{"paragraph": " That stimulus, you recognize, is equally compatible with translating “Gavagai!” as “There goes a rabbit!”, “There goes an unde- tached part of a rabbit!”, or “There goes a temporal stage in a rabbit’s life history!” (among many other candidates). And, from an objective, Rabbits and Rabbit Stages 141 scientific viewpoint, the translation-relevant evidence includes only patterns of stimuli and verbal response. Thus, you conclude, there is no fact of the matter about which is the correct translation. All of the candidates are equally correct. Can you pin down the meaning by making more empirical obser- vations of the tribe-members’ linguistic behavior? Initially, that might seem promising. Suppose you surmise that their expression “Bleeg” corresponds to the English expression “is the same as.” You get the rabbit to scurry by a few more times, and you notice that they say “Bleeg Gavagai!” when it does. Could you then rule out that they mean “There goes a rabbit stage” by “Gavagai!”? Perhaps. After all, the rabbit stage you see this time is not the same rabbit stage that you saw before. But, on reflection, the very problem you tried to avoid now arises for “Bleeg.” If you use only the objective evidence regarding stimulus and response as your guide, then you could equally translate “Bleeg” as “belongs with,” for example. On reflection, you conclude, no further observations will solve the problem. Quine uses considerations of that sort to conclude that meaning is indeterminate. That Quinean doctrine often goes under the heading of the indeterminacy of translation. But it is not just about translation or about unknown languages. It applies to all languages, including Eng- lish. If the native speakers whose language you were studying tried to make a translation manual running from English to their language, they’d be led to exactly the same indeterminacy conclusions about English that you drew about their language.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "Can making more empirical observations of a language's speakers help to pin down the meaning of a word or phrase?", "answer": "No, making more observations will not solve the problem. The same problem will arise for any new words or phrases introduced, such as the word \"Bleeg\", which could be translated in multiple ways based on the observed evidence.", "question_group_id": "c7f09338-46a3-4bc6-9556-46dc3edf6a04", "paragraph_idx": 211, "question_idx": 1}
