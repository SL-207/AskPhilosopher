{"paragraph": " THE CASE Consider a typical synesthete whom we’ll call Cyndi. Cyndi has chromesthesia. For her, making breakfast is a very colorful experience. When she puts the bacon into the pan and hears the sizzle, she has a sensation of red. When she cracks an egg, she has a sensation of blue. And when she pours orange juice into a glass, she has a sensation of green. How are we to characterize these color experiences? Are they per- ceptual in nature? If so, should we say that Cyndi is seeing green or hearing green? Neither of these options seems satisfactory. On the one hand, given that colors are typically discriminated vis- ually, it may seem tempting to say that Cyndi is seeing green as she’s pouring the orange juice. But there is nothing green in her visual field. Her eyes may even be closed while she is having the relevant experience. Moreover, given that her color experience is caused by Synesthesia 219 an auditory stimulus, it may seem odd to characterize her perceptual experience as something that’s visual in nature. One way that we dis- tinguish auditory experiences from visual experiences is in terms of the kinds of inputs that generate the relevant experience. In Cyndi’s case, there is not the kind of input typical of visual experiences. In this case, the input is auditory in nature. That suggests that we should say she is hearing the color. And in fact, this is how synesthesia is often described, as in neurologist Rich- ard Cytowic’s 1998 book titled, The Man Who Tasted Shapes (see also Brang and Ramachandran 2011). But it’s not clear how we are to make sense of the claim that colors can be heard. Given the nature of colors, they are not the kinds of experiences that can be discrim- inated from one another by way of auditory perception. All of their properties are visual in nature (hue, brightness, etc.). They do not have auditory properties (volume, tone, etc.). So, it’s hard to know how to classify Cyndi’s perceptual experience.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "If Cyndi is not seeing the color, should we say that she is hearing the color?", "answer": "Yes, it seems that we should say that Cyndi is hearing the color, as the input that generates her experience is auditory in nature.
