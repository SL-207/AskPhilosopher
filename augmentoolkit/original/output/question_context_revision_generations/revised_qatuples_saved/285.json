According to exter- nalism, which mental contents we have depends constitutively on what physical and social environment we are in—for example, whether the stuff that makes up our lakes and oceans is composed chemi- cally of H2O or some other chemical substance, such as XYZ. In the late 20th century, some philosophers began to embrace a more radical form of externalism on which the mental “extends” out into the world in a much stronger sense.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the name of the philosopher who wrote the paper \"Social Externalism and Conceptual Errors\" in 2001?", "answer": "The philosopher who wrote the paper \"Social Externalism and Conceptual Errors\" in 2001 is Asa M.
