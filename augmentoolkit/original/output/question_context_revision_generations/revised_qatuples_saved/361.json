{"paragraph": " Locke falls into the second camp, and the particular psy- chological facts on which he focuses are facts about memory. Suppose we have a person we’ll call A existing at a certain time t1, and a person we’ll call B existing at some later time t2. On Locke’s view, B is the same person as A if and only if B remembers an experience had by A. 39 The Prince and the Cobbler 241 The thought experiment we’ll consider in this chapter is put forth to support this view. THE CASE Consider two men living very different lives in the same town. The first is a wealthy prince. He resides in a grand palace with the rest of the royal family, and his every need is catered to by a coterie of servants. He spends his days eating lavish meals, engaging in various leisure activities, and making occasional public appearances where he is applauded by his loyal subjects. The second is a poor cobbler. He resides in a ramshackle cottage and, together with his wife, he is raising several children. He spends his days working hard to repair shoes, and has almost no time for leisure activities. Money is tight, and the family typically has barely enough to eat. One night, in a mysterious twist, the prince’s consciousness somehow comes to in- habit the body of the cobbler. The individual who wakes up in the cobbler’s bed has no idea where he is. His surroundings are com- pletely unfamiliar to him. He doesn’t recognize the woman sleeping beside him, or the young children sleeping in a cramped second room. The threadbare and uncomfortable sleeping garment he finds himself wearing is completely different from the luscious dressing gown that he had been wearing when he went to bed. He can re- member being brought up in the palace, eating delicacies at every meal, and being waited on hand and foot. He’s still having the same kinds of princely thoughts he’s always had, but everyone around him takes him to be the cobbler.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What are the two men in the thought experiment, and what are their lives like?", "answer": "The two men are a wealthy prince and a poor cobbler.
