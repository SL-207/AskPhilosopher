{"paragraph": " As he puts it, “The semantic features of language are public features” (1979/1984, p. 235). According to Davidson, no element of meaning can be a private matter, to which an individual speaker has privileged access—even when it comes to the words that she herself CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 144 uses on a particular occasion. Instead, meaning (semantics) is a function of only publicly observable facts. And, plausibly enough, the publicly observable facts might not determine that when I say “rabbit” I mean rabbit rather than rabbit stage. But once again, that leaves us with a choice. We could accept that meaning and reference are indeterminate, and concede that this is true even of one’s own words. Or we could take Davidson’s reasoning to show that his starting assumption, that meaning is a function of only publicly observable facts, is false. The choice has consequences. If we make the latter choice, reject- ing the bases for Quinean indeterminacy doctrines, then we take the first-person perspective of individual speakers to play some vital role in determining meaning (Kripke 1977, Searle 1983). And it is not entirely clear what that role is. If we make the former choice, siding with Quine and Davidson, then different questions arise. Quine and Davidson do not simply accept indeterminacy and leave it at that. Their approach leads to positive projects. In light of indeterminacy, how can we attribute meaning to the words we and others use? Many who take a Quinean approach, including Quine himself, propose constraints on translation and interpretation, such as the principle of charity. Roughly, good translations should maximize agreement be- tween us and the people whose language we are translating. David Lewis (1974) adds several other constraints, such as a rationalization principle: speakers should be interpreted as rational agents. And those are just a few of the consequences.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What does it mean that the semantic features of language are public features?", "answer": "The semantic features of language are public features, meaning that no element of meaning can be a private matter, and that meaning (semantics) is a function of only publicly observable facts.", "question_group_id": "642df6d5-f048-4dea-b85d-890e32569a6c", "paragraph_idx": 4, "question_idx": 0}
