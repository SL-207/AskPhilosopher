{"paragraph": "” beyond the observable, objective facts con- cerning physical dispositions to respond to verbal stimuli. But some question the basis for Quine’s rejection of that assumption. A commonsense response to Quine’s argument is to say, “Hey, I know what my words mean, at least sometimes.” That response won’t convince Quineans. They will complain that it assumes that meaning is at least partly a psychological matter, known by the speaker—and again, for Quine, meaning is not at all a psychological matter. Mean- ing is a matter of patterns of stimuli and response and is best under- stood from an objective, scientific viewpoint. You might well associate the words you use with psychological states you have. But those states do not figure directly in linguistic meaning. Instead, their linguistic role is only to produce responses to relevant stimuli. Nevertheless, some (Searle 1983, Blackburn 1984, Glock 2003) de- fend versions of that commonsense response. For example, according to John Searle, Quine’s argument is best regarded as a reductio ad ab- surdum (that is, a reduction to absurdity) of the assumptions on which it is based. As noted above (in the background section), Quine’s argu- ment begins with the behaviorist assumption that linguistic meaning is entirely a non-psychological matter, and instead concerns objective facts about physical dispositions to respond to external stimuli. Given that assumption, Quine’s indeterminacy doctrine does indeed follow. Rabbits and Rabbit Stages 143 But that just shows that we should reject the assumption. If we ac- cepted the indeterminacy doctrine, then distinctions that we know independently to be perfectly legitimate would be undermined. For example, we know independently that there is a difference between the tribe-member’s meaning rabbit and her meaning rabbit stage. Yet, under Quine’s behaviorist assumption, that difference disappears.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is one potential consequence of accepting Quine's indeterminacy doctrine?", "answer": "One potential consequence of accepting Quine's indeterminacy doctrine is that distinctions that we know independently to be perfectly legitimate would be undermined.
