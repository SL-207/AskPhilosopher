Contemporary philosophers often character- ize the physical by deferring to physics: physical phenomena are the entities described by fundamental physics, or those plus entities that are constructed from them (Loewer 2001; see Chapter 21). In other words, to be physical is to be, or to be made of, entities that exist at the fundamental level of physical reality. For example, if quarks and lep- tons are posited by fundamental physics, then they and the things they compose are physical. But what if there is no fundamental level? For example, what if quarks and leptons are composed of more basic enti- ties? And what if those more basic entities are composed of still more basic entities, and so on forever (ad infinitum)? Physicalism shouldn’t rule that possibility out. But how can that be avoided? Barbara Gail Montero (2006) develops an elegant solution to the problem described above—of how to reconcile physicalism with the possibility that there are no fundamental physical phenomena.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "How do contemporary philosophers typically define what it means to be physical?", "answer": "Contemporary philosophers often define the physical by deferring to physics, meaning that physical phenomena are the entities described by fundamental physics, or those entities that are constructed from them.", "question_group_id": "cd2f1f74-cc8d-4b73-a81e-0f1aece0ef4d", "paragraph_idx": 124, "question_idx": 1}
