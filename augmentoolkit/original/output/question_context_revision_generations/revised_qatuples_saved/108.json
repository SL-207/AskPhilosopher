{"paragraph": " Consideration of any inner mechanisms underlying ­behavioral ­dispositions fell outside the scope of the behaviorist par- adigm. ­During that same period, a corresponding view was widely discussed in ­philosophy (Carnap 1932, Hempel 1935, Ryle 1949). Philosophical ­behaviorism does not concern methodology. Instead, its central thesis is that ­mental states consist in behavioral ­dispositions. The relevant ­behavioral ­dispositions might be highly complex, but the ­implication is that the mental is nothing over and above the ­dispositional. Prior to Putnam’s (1963) super-spartans argument, the debate about ­philosophical ­behaviorism focused largely on whether the meaning of statements containing mentalistic terms—such as “belief” and “pain”—can be adequately characterized in terms of statements ­describing behavioral dispositions (Chisholm 1957, Geach 1957). Putnam regarded such issues, which are linguistic and con- ceptual, as peripheral to behaviorism’s central thesis, which is about 14 The Super-Spartans 83 mental states themselves: about pain rather than the concept of pain, for example. Often when people feel pain they exhibit characteristic pain behavior, such as wincing, screaming, gritting their teeth, etc. Sometimes people feel pain but suppress such behavior. But even then they are disposed to exhibit such behavior, at least normally. That much is not controversial; but, according to philosophical behaviorism, to experience pain is to have the associated sorts of dispositional states. According to Putnam, that thesis is false. He devises a series of thought experiments designed to demonstrate its falsity. THE CASE Imagine a community of super-spartans in which the adults can ­suppress all involuntary pain behavior. They feel pain; but when they do, they don’t wince, scream, etc. Then, after millions of years, the super-spartans begin to have children who are born with the capacity to suppress pain behavior and the spartan belief that one should always do so.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What is the primary thesis of philosophical behaviorism, and what does it imply about the nature of mental states?", "answer": "The primary thesis of philosophical behaviorism is that mental states consist in behavioral dispositions.
