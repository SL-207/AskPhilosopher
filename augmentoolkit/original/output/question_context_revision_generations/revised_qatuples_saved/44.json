{"paragraph": " But defenders of the solution argue that this criticism equivocates on two different notions of “seems” (Jackson 1977, Fantl and Howell 2003). We might say that there is a phenomenal sense of “seems,” which captures the qualitative nature of our conscious states, and a cogni- tive sense of “seems,” which reflects the judgments we are inclined to make. We can have seemings in the sense that there is something that it is like to see a 39-speckled hen, and this is qualitatively different from what it is like to see a 40-speckled hen; but we cannot form a reliable judgment about that phenomenology. It thus seems a certain way in that we have a certain determinate conscious state; but, be- cause our judgments about that phenomenology are distinct from the phenomenology itself, we can be wrong about how things seem phe- nomenally (see Chapter 32.) As introduced above in the background section, the theory of seemings had two parts, one epistemic and the other metaphysical. This argument suggests they might stem from an ambiguity in the use of “seems” and that they can be, and perhaps should be, divorced from one another.
