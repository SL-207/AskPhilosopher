{"paragraph": " But of course, electromagnetic forces are sufficient to produce light, as was shown by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century. So, something must be wrong with the structure of this rea- soning and, correspondingly, with the structure of the Chinese Room example. As the Churchlands diagnose it, the problem is that waving a magnet around will not generate enough force to produce light that is detectable to the human eye. But there is luminance there. Likewise, the fact that the person in the Chinese Room cannot detect PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 108 understanding does not mean that there isn’t understanding there. It just might be at too low a level to be detectable. In criticizing the Chinese Room, the Churchlands also suggest that Searle’s Chinese Room, with only a single individual and rulebook, is based on a problematic model of what kind of computation is done by the brain. Brain processes operate via parallel processing. In the Churchlands’ view, connectionist networks are a much more prom- ising computational model than the kind of symbol processing on which Searle focuses. Responding to this kind of case, Searle suggests that we could con- sider a whole Chinese gym with numerous individuals working to- gether instead of just the original case of a single individual inside a single room. Still, he says, there won’t be understanding. Note, how- ever, that in moving from a single individual to a group of individuals, some of the force of the original thought experiment is blunted. In the initial version of the case, an individual can imagine being in the Chinese Room and assessing from a first-person perspective that they would lack understanding. If many individuals are involved, the rele- vant assessment can no longer be made from this perspective.
