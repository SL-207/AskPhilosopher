{"paragraph": " On this strategy, dualism is built into our concepts; but that is perfectly consistent with a ­physicalist view about what our concepts pick out. Non-­physicalists counter that this strategy doesn’t succeed. It merely relocates the ­problem the ­zombie case brings out. If phenomenal concepts are ­really so ­distinctive—if their features can explain the ideal ­conceivability of a zombie world—then those concepts will themselves be ­non-­physical, and so the anti-physicalist argument can be reinstated (Chalmers 2007; for further discussion, see Balog 2012, Alter 2023).
