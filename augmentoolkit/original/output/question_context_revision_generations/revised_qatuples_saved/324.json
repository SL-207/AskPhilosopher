{"paragraph": " Consider the sports fan or the sugar water study participant. When watching the match replay, the fan might be vividly imagining that they are present at the match. When faced with the option of drinking from a glass labeled “poison,” the study participant might be vividly imag- ining that the glass contains poison. Moreover, though imagination is often quarantined off from belief, it is not always so—as Gendler herself has argued in other work (2006). In many cases when we engage with fiction or games of pretend, our imaginings are not cor- doned off from what we believe, but are integrated in various ways with that content. In reality, what happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay there either. A different kind of criticism arises from Gendler’s ­characterization of alief as having a novel kind of content that combines representa- tional, affective, and behavioral elements all in one. Some have charged that alief seems best understood as an amalgam of different kinds of mental state types rather than as single, unified mental-state type of its own (Doggett 2012). Though the different components of alief may tend to be co-activated, that doesn’t entail that there is any greater unity to the phenomenon, and certainly not the kind of unity that generates the postulation of a sui generis mental-state type.
