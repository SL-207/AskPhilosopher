{"paragraph": " Other dualists have taken the second option (Mills 1996, Lowe 2003): they claim that mental properties do, as a matter of fact, over- determine their effects; while the physical cause is there, so too is an additional mental cause. This would be a curious state of affairs, but it seems possible. Even though it gives us an inelegant world, and one The Exclusion Problem 75 where it doesn’t seem mentality is causally needed, perhaps there is room here to save our intuitions about mental causation. In recent years, a number of philosophers who reject the ­traditional physicalist picture of mental phenomena have sought to avoid the ex- clusion argument by turning away from traditional property dualism to something like Russellian monism (see Chapter 4.) On that view, mental properties—or proto-mental properties that are not ­themselves mental but contain the seeds of mentality—actually ground all of the physical properties in the world. In contrast to the traditional ­picture, on which mental properties do not emerge until you get to the level of brains, Russellian monists see the world as having a mental or ­proto-mental base which ultimately explains the physical phenomena. Though this requires the denial of completeness, the Russellian mon- ist will argue that they can do so in an empirically ­unobjectionable way. For a critical discussion of the Russellian strategy as a solution to the exclusion problem see Howell (2015), and for a response see Alter and Coleman (2021).

If mental properties cannot cause physical effects without being excluded by the physical cause, then it appears that they play no causal role at all. This is a problem for dualism, which posits that mental properties are real and have a causal role.", "question_group_id": "ff1d1ffd-c52d-42d5-87d6-38f736b537be", "paragraph_idx": 208, "question_idx": 4}
