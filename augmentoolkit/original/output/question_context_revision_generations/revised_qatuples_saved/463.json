{"paragraph": " Try to turn inwards away from the black text itself and focus on the blackness of your experience. What happens when you do? Does your attention slip through to the blackness of the text before you? Can you keep it from doing so and focus on the blackness of your experience itself, rather than the blackness of the text? DISCUSSION The example of Eloise comes from Gilbert Harman (1990), but other representationalists use similar examples to make the same point (see, e.g., Tye 1995, p. 30). This point about attention seems to have been first noticed by G. E. Moore, who claimed that, when we’re having a blue experience and we “try to introspect the sensation of blue, all we can see is the blue: the other element is as if it were diaphanous” (1903, p. 25). In line with this notion of diaphanousness, contempo- rary philosophers talk of the transparency of experience, and they tend to take examples like Eloise to establish what’s often referred to as the transparency thesis. According to this thesis, experience is transparent in the way that a pane of glass is transparent. Just as we see right through a pane of glass to whatever is on the other side of it, we “see” right through our experience to whatever it is representing. PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 112 Though transparency has been most commonly discussed with respect to visual experience, many philosophers take it to be true for perceptual experiences generally (Tye 1995). For example, Clare Batty (2010) has argued that olfactory experience is transparent. On her view, when we’re having an olfactory experience, the properties we’re smelling are presented to us as out in the world or as around us. Granted, we might not always know what object in particular has produced the relevant odor. But, she argues, when we try to attend to an olfactory experience, we “smell” through that experience directly to the world, even if not to particular external objects in the world.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What does the transparency of experience suggest about the relationship between experience and the external world?", "answer": "The transparency of experience suggests that experience is not a veil or barrier between us and the external world, but rather a transparent window through which we can see and perceive the world directly.", "question_group_id": "7a824785-8427-4432-b35a-a8ce7948ce7a", "paragraph_idx": 1, "question_idx": 4}
