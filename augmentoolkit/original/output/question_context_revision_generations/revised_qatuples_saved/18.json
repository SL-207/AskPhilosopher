{"paragraph": " A zombie world is ideally conceivable (that is, conceivable on ideal reflection). 2. If a zombie world is ideally conceivable, then it is metaphysi- cally possible (that is, possible in the broadest sense, rather than, say, relative to natural laws). 3. If a zombie world is metaphysically possible, then physicalism is false. CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 40 Conclusion: physicalism is false. The features of consciousness that distinguish you and your zom- bie twin are sometimes called “phenomenal properties” or “qualia”. Zombies lack qualia. For that reason, zombie cases are sometimes de- scribed as “absent qualia” cases (see Chapter 16). DISCUSSION Some respond to the zombie argument by rejecting physicalism and exploring non-physicalist alternatives, such as dualism (Chalmers 1996; see Chapter 4). Others respond by rejecting one or more of the zombie argument’s three main premises. Though all three premises have been challenged, most accept the third and reject either the first or the second (though for a challenge to the third, see Montero 2013, and for a reply see Alter 2023). The discussion tends to get pretty technical. But the basic ideas are fairly intuitive. To reject the first premise is to deny that a zombie world is ideally conceivable. Sometimes something seems conceivable at first, but on reflection we realize we are just confused. Recall an example from Chapter 3. In objecting to Descartes’ conceivability argument, Ar- nauld (1641) suggests that someone might be able to conceive of a right triangle that doesn’t conform to the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of its sides is slightly greater than its hypotenuse squared. But such a triangle isn’t ideally conceivable. Enough reflection would reveal that it makes no sense. (To put the point in the language that we used in Chapter 3, their idea of the right triangle is not clear and distinct; they are not using concepts that are sufficiently compre- hensive.", "metadata": "Philosophy of Mind_ 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments by Torin Alter & Robert J", "question": "What does it mean for a physicalist to say that a zombie world is metaphysically possible?", "answer": "If a physicalist says that a zombie world is metaphysically possible, then it means that physicalism is false, since a zombie world by definition lacks consciousness and qualia.", "question_group_id": "60527424-1361-41df-8b39-ca9d77cf4c2f", "paragraph_idx": 203, "question_idx": 2}
