    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ something must be wrong with the structure of this rea- soning and, correspondingly,\
    \ with the structure of the Chinese Room example. As the Churchlands diagnose\
    \ it, the problem is that waving a magnet around will not generate enough force\
    \ to produce light that is detectable to the human eye. But there is luminance\

    \ PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 108 understanding does not\

    \ that Searle’s Chinese Room, with only a single individual and rulebook, is based\
    \ on a problematic model of what kind of computation is done by the brain. Brain\
    \ processes operate via parallel processing. In the Churchlands’ view, connectionist\
    \ networks are a much more prom- ising computational model than the kind of symbol\
    \ processing on which Searle focuses. Responding to this kind of case, Searle\
    \ suggests that we could con- sider a whole Chinese gym with numerous individuals\

    \ inside a single room. Still, he says, there won’t be understanding. Note, how-\

    \ of the force of the original thought experiment is blunted. In the initial version\
    \ of the case, an individual can imagine being in the Chinese Room and assessing\
