    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ one concerns the nature of sense perception and the individuation of the senses.\
    \ How can we make sense of an experience’s being visual in nature rather than\
    \ auditory or rather than tactile? Some philosophers try to dis- tinguish the\
    \ senses by way of the sensory organ used; some try to distinguish them in terms\
    \ of typical (and often proprietary) stimuli. But both of these ways of doing\
    \ so are challenged by the case of synesthesia. Cyndi need not be using her eyes\
    \ to “see” red when the bacon sizzles. Moreover, the stimulus she actually senses\
    \ (the sound of sizzling bacon) is proprietary to audition, while color is proprietary\
    \ to vision. In response to this puzzle, some researchers have suggested that\
    \ we need to rethink the way we differentiate the senses from one an- other. Generally\
    \ speaking, for example, discussions of the senses treat them as relatively discrete\
    \ systems. As noted by Brian Keeley, “it is common to assume that the different\
    \ senses are significantly separate and independent of one another” (2002, p.\
    \ 25). Synesthesia calls this assumption into question. If we were to drop this\
    \ assumption, then synesthesia would no longer be as puzzling. Dropping this assumption\
    \ would also enable us to provide a better account of other puzzling phenomena,\
    \ such as the McGurk effect—a phenomenon in which the same syllable is heard differently\
    \ depending on the visual input one is having. For example, when one looks at\
    \ a face making the typ- ical mouth movements associated with “Fa,” one will hear\
    \ the syllable “Ba” as “Fa”. On this kind of response to the puzzle of synesthesia,\
    \ rather than thinking of synesthesia as a case where the senses have gotten “cross-wired,”\
    \ perhaps we should conceive of the senses as not being separately wired in the\
    \ first place. Synesthesia 221 In addition to presenting a puzzle about the individuation\
    \ of the senses, synesthesia has also been thought to raise challenges for func-\
    \ tionalist theories of mind (Gray, 2004).\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text):\
    \ \"\"\"How can we make sense of an experience's being visual in nature rather\
    \ than auditory or tactile, given the challenges posed by synesthesia?\"\"\"\n\
    \nIf the question clearly goes off the rails and is incoherent, then it is irrelevant.\
