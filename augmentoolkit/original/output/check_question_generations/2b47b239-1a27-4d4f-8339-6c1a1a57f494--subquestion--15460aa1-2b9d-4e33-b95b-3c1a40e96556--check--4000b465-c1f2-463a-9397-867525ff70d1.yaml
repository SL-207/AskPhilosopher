    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ that took place on Earth, such as your perceiving green things and interacting\
    \ with others. But, according to Ned Block (1990), this will gradually change.\
    \ For example, after enough time has passed, the typical cause of your phenomenally\
    \ green experiences will be interaction with red things. And Block takes this\
    \ to show that qualia can’t be identified with representational properties, at\
    \ least as representational properties are typically characterized. He also takes\
    \ Inverted Earth to vindicate qualia realism, on which there are intrinsic mental\
    \ features of our experience: features that are not grounded in relations—environmental\
    \ relations, functional relations, or any other PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS\
    \ OF MIND 120 relations. In Block’s view, if there were no such intrinsic features,\
    \ then your qualia would gradually change as their representational features do.\
    \ But your qualia don’t gradually change in that way. Block’s argument depends\
    \ on controversial premises. For example, some challenge the premise that the\
    \ phenomenal (qualitative) character of your mental states remains constant as\
    \ their representational charac- ter shifts (Lycan 1996, Tye 2000). And some detach\
    \ representationalism from the causal co-variation account of representational\
    \ properties. For example, on one view, the phenomenal character of color experiences\
    \ is intrinsically representational; what it represents depends only par- tially\
    \ on the environment (Chalmers 2004). But it is interesting to note that the Inverted\
    \ Earth case involves an inversion that is the con- verse of the more traditional\
    \ inverted qualia cases. Instead of inverting the qualia and keeping the representational\
    \ (or functional or physical) properties constant, in this case it is the ­representational\
    \ properties that are inverted while the qualia are kept constant.\n\"\"\"\n\n\
