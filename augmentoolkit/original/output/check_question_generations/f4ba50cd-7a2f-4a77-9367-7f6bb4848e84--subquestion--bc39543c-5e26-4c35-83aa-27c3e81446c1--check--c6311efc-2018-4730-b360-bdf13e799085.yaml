    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ the concept of belief is characterized in terms of the typical causal role belief\
    \ plays; and belief itself is identified with whatever state typically plays that\
    \ role. On analytic functionalism, the explanation of how Martian pain is possible\
    \ is straightforward. What it means to feel pain, on this view, is to have a state\
    \ (any state) that plays painâ€™s characteristic causal role. That causal role is\
    \ explained in a way that makes no essential refer- ence to human (or non-human)\
    \ physiology. Martyâ€™s pain is possible because he has states that play that role.\
    \ Analytic functionalism also delivers an explanation of the possibility of mad\
    \ pain. The theory identifies pain itself with the state that typically plays\
    \ painâ€™s character- istic causal role, relative to some population. Maddy is human,\
    \ and in humans c-fiber stimulation typically plays that role. Maddy feels pain\
    \ because she has that neural state, even though in her that neural state does\
    \ not play its typical causal role. Further, as Lewis explains, analytic functionalism\
    \ can explain not only mad pain and Martian pain but also mad Martian pain. Mad\
    \ Martian pain is the Martian version of mad pain, and can be explained in the\
    \ same way. The mad Martian is a member of the Martian species despite their madness.\
    \ They feel pain because they have the state that typically plays the relevant\
    \ causal role in Martians, even though in them that state does not play that role.\
    \ Key to Lewisâ€™s solution is species (or population) relativity. The states that\
    \ play the relevant causal role can differ from one species (or population) to\
    \ the next, as the cases of human pain and Martian pain illustrate. Significantly,\
    \ although Maddy feels pain, she does so partly in virtue of her membership in\
    \ the human species. But that aspect of Lewisâ€™s solution can seem implausible.\
    \ Whether an individual human PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND\
