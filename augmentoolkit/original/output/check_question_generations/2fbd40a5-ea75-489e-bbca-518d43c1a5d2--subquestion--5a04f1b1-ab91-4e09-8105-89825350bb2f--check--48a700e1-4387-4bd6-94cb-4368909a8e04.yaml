    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ movements of the subatomic activity that underlies the organism’s behavior—its\
    \ attempt to get out of danger. But they would miss what causes that behavior,\
    \ and would probably fail to understand that there was behavior—as opposed to\
    \ mere physical motions—in the first place. The Puzzle of the Special Sciences\
    \ 79 Although psychology neither talks about anything non-physical nor contravenes\
    \ the laws of physics, it is an autonomous science all the same. Some (such as\
    \ Fodor himself, and many of the non-reductive materialists mentioned in the previous\
    \ chapter) draw a moral for the philosophy of mind: mental states are physical\
    \ states, but they are not identical to those states (and cannot be reduced to\
    \ them) because they are governed by distinct laws. DISCUSSION Probably the most\
    \ influential counterpoint to Fodor’s picture of the special sciences comes from\
    \ Jaegwon Kim (1992). Kim finds some- thing suspicious about Fodor’s story in\
    \ “Special Sciences.” The story, in Kim’s view, depends on claiming that there\
    \ is a law in the ­special sciences but no corresponding law in the physical sciences.\
    \ Kim ­questions this assumption: Why not take the special-sciences law to be\
    \ a law in physical science? Staying with the economics analogy, Fodor’s answer\
    \ might seem obvious: units of currency are not physical kinds like quarks, charge,\
    \ mass, etc. But that seemingly obvious answer itself raises questions. Granted,\
    \ any particular instance of currency is realized by something physical (paper,\
    \ copper, electrons, etc.), but the kind itself is not physical. One might wonder,\
    \ though, why there can’t be a disjunctive kind: “P1 or P2 or P3 or P4”—where\
    \ P1 is the physical basis of paper money, P2 of copper money, P3 of digital currency,\
    \ and so on? Though it’s a disjunctive kind, it involves only physical terms.\
    \ So, why isn’t it a physical kind that can be included in physical laws?\n\"\"\
