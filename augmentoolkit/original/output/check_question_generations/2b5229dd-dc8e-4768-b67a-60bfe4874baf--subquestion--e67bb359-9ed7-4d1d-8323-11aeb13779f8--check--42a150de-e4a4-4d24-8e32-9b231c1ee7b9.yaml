    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ are often treated as cases of “sympathetic magic” (Rozin et al. 1986). Let’s\
    \ flesh out the details of the last example. Study participants saw an experimenter\
    \ open a commercially labe- led box of sugar and pour some of it into two clean,\
    \ empty bottles. They were then given two labels—one that said “sucrose” and one\
    \ that said “sodium cyanide, poison”—and instructed to stick one to each bottle.\
    \ The participants watched while water from the same source was poured into two\
    \ glasses, and they also saw some powder from the bottle marked “poison” mixed\
    \ into one glass and some powder from the bottle marked “sucrose” mixed into the\
    \ other glass. Following all of this, participants were asked to rate how willing\
    \ they were to take a sip from each glass, and the results showed a significant\
    \ preference for the bottle that was labeled “sucrose”—even though participants\
    \ acknowledged that they knew there was no poison in either glass, and that both\
    \ glasses contained the same sugar water (Rozin et al. 1986). How do we account\
    \ for these cases? It doesn’t look like an instance of contradictory beliefs.\
    \ People at Skywalk don’t seem to have the The Skywalk 209 belief “It’s not safe”\
    \ alongside their belief “It’s safe.” And it’s hard to see how people in the sugar\
    \ water experiment would believe “There’s poison in this glass.” Do they merely\
    \ imagine that Skywalk is unsafe or that there’s poison in the glass? The problem\
    \ with this suggestion is that imaginings tend to be quarantined off from real-life\
    \ belief and ac- tion. As Gendler puts it, imagination is like Las Vegas—what\
    \ happens in imagination stays in imagination (2008b, p. 568). DISCUSSION In Gendler’s\
    \ view, the best way to resolve the puzzle is to postulate the existence of a\
    \ novel mental state—what she calls alief. Alief is a state that is associative,\
    \ automatic, and arational. It is not reducible to belief or other mental states/attitudes.\n\
