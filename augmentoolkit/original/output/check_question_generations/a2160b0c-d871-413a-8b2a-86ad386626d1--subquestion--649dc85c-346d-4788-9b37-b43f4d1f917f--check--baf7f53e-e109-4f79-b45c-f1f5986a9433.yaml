    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ right triangle is a three-sided closed figure with one 90-degree angle needs\
    \ to learn more before their concept of right triangle will be of use in conceivability\
    \ arguments, as they don’t yet understand what other properties go along with\
    \ a fig- ure’s having a right angle. Their concept is still incomplete. But now\
    \ consider a simple and straightforward concept like bachelor. Once you know that\
    \ the definition of “bachelor” is “unmarried man of eligible ­marrying age,” that’s\
    \ all you need to know for your concept to be clear and complete—that is, to be\
    \ sufficiently comprehensive for use in ­conceivability arguments. Given that\
    \ Gertler requires that a concept must be sufficiently comprehensive for it to\
    \ be of use in conceivability arguments, her thought experiment will succeed in\
    \ supporting dualism only if our concept of pain is sufficiently comprehensive.\
    \ To defend this assertion about our concept of pain, Gertler contrasts the concept\
    \ of pain with the concept of water. Someone might know how water feels and tastes,\
    \ while being ignorant of its chemical composition. They might not know that water\
    \ is H2O. As Gertler puts the point, water has a hidden essence. This essence\
    \ can be discovered only by way of scientific investigation. On her view, pain\
    \ is unlike water in this respect: “Pain wears its essential nature on its sleeve,\
    \ as it were” (Gertler 2007: 40). Because we conceptualize pain in terms of the\
    \ way it feels—or, as it’s often put, in terms of its phenomenology—it lacks a\
    \ hidden essence. Though we do not come to know the essence of water in virtue\
    \ of feeling it, we do come to know the essence of pain in virtue of feeling it.\
    \ Thus, in Gertler’s view, our concept of pain is sufficiently comprehensive to\
    \ be used in an argument that moves from conceiv- ability to possibility. The\
