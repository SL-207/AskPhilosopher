    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\

    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ Due to genetics, it’s likely that sometimes (though rarely) G-cones contain\
    \ the photopigment that R-cones usually contain, and vice versa. According to\
    \ Nida-Rümelin, this can result in red/green qualia inversion. Moreover, she suggests\
    \ that the resulting inverts might be behaviorally indistinguishable from non-inverts.\
    \ Others argue that the scientific evidence points in the opposite direction—that\
    \ is, that such behaviorally indistinguishable inverts are empirically impossible\
    \ (e.g., Hardin 1988, Hilbert and Kalderon 2000). For example, for behaviorally\
    \ indistinguishable inverts to exist, experiences of red and green would have\
    \ to be symmetrical, and that is not so. For example, C. L. Hardin (1988) argues\
    \ that, for humans, red is “warm” whereas green is “cool.” Perhaps that particular\
    \ asymmetry could also be inverted (Block 1990), but some argue that others can-\
    \ not (Hilbert and Kalderon 2000). Some of the debate concerns not just red/green\
    \ inversion, but inversion of the entire color spectrum; traditionally, inverted\
    \ qualia cases are called “inverted spectrum” cases. But red/green qualia inversion\
    \ suffices for the central philosophical arguments, such as the argument against\
    \ functionalism. To succeed, the inverted qualia argument against functionalism\
    \ ­requires more than behavioral indistinguishability. Invert would have to be\
    \ functionally indistinguishable from non-inverts. Her phenomenally red experiences\
    \ would have to relate to her other mental states in the way phenomenally green\
    \ experiences do in non-inverts, and vice versa. That is even harder to vindicate\
    \ empirically. However, at least as stated above, the argument against functionalism\
    \ requires only that function- ally indistinguishable inverted qualia are possible,\
    \ in the broadest (meta- physical) sense (Shoemaker 1982, Block 1990, ­Chalmers\
