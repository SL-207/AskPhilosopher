    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ one state a belief and the other a desire? Can anything general be said about\
    \ the difference, beyond simply repeat- ing that one is a belief and the other\
    \ is a desire? Elizabeth Anscombe (1957) suggests (or at least has been taken\
    \ to suggest) that a key dif- ference is what she calls “direction of fit.” Her\
    \ famous case of the shopping list illustrates this concept. THE CASE Imagine\
    \ a man walking through a grocery store with a shopping list. The list says: cheese,\
    \ bread, chocolate, grapes …. Following him is a detective who writes her own\
    \ list, based on what the man bought. Her list says: cheese, bread, chocolate,\
    \ grapes …. These lists are in some sense exactly the same—they name the same\
    \ items. But they also 29 The Shopping List 179 differ. The shopper’s list guides\
    \ the shopper’s actions—to make the list accurate, he must fill his cart with\
    \ the listed items. The items should match the list. The detective’s list, on\
    \ the other hand, is meant to re- flect what the shopper bought. The list should\
    \ match the items. So, suppose that the man gets home and finds that instead of\
    \ grapes he bought grappa. The shopper can’t fix his mistake by crossing “grapes”\
    \ off the list and replacing it with “grappa.” This would miss the point of the\
    \ list—to fix the mistake he needs to go back and trade the grappa for the grapes.\
    \ If the detective, on the other hand, has “grapes” on her list when the man bought\
    \ grappa, she can fix the mistake by correcting her list. The point can be glossed\
    \ by the idea that the lists have different directions of fit. The detective’s\
    \ list has to fit the way the world turns out to be. The shopper has to make the\
    \ world fit the list. ­Anscombe’s suggestion, then, is that mental states differ\
    \ in the same way as the lists. Beliefs are like the detective’s list: they aim\
    \ at match- ing the way the world is. Desires are like the shopper’s list: they\
    \ aim at making the world match the agent’s representation of it.\n\"\"\"\n\n\
    Question (based on text): \"\"\"Can you give an example of how this difference\
