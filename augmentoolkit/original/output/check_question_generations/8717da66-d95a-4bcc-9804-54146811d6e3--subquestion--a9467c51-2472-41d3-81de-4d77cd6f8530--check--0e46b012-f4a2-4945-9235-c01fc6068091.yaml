    \ you will check if the question is answerable, given the information in the paragraphs.\
    \ Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not\
    \ the question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. \n\nFollowing this,\
    \ at the very end of your response, your \"final judgment\" or \"final answer\"\
    , you will write \"Relevant\" or \"Irrelevant\" depending on your analysis of\
    \ the question with regards to the text. \n\nNote a special exception: if a question\
    \ includes information that isn't in the paragraphs, but is clearly (DIRECTLY,\

    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ views of one of the world’s Seven Natural Wonders await you at Grand Canyon\
    \ West on Skywalk. This breathtaking 10-foot wide, horseshoe-shaped glass bridge\
    \ extends 70 feet out over the rim of the Grand Canyon, giving you a clear view\
    \ 4,000 feet to the Canyon floor be- low. There’s simply no thrill like stepping\
    \ out on glass thousands of feet in the air, yet there’s no need to be nervous—Skywalk\
    \ is strong enough to hold seventy fully loaded 747 passenger jets. (https://grandcanyonwest.com/things-to-do/skywalk/)\
    \ PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 208 In the first five years after its\
    \ opening, more than 1.8 million people vis- ited Skywalk, and in January 2020\
    \ attendance hit the 10 million visitor mark. Presumably, visitors to Skywalk\
    \ believe it is safe. They have read the statistics, and they see all the people\
    \ safely walking across it. And it’s hard to believe that anyone would step out\
    \ onto a bridge that high if they really had any doubt that they were in danger.\
    \ Yet it is not at all uncommon for people to hesitate before stepping out. Some\
    \ end up refusing to go through with the experience, despite having paid a hefty\
    \ admission fee. And even those who do manage to make it to the center of the\
    \ bridge are likely to feel a rush of vertigo as they do so. Despite their belief\
    \ that everything is safe, it’s as if there’s some inner voice yell- ing at them\
    \ “Danger! Danger! Really high! Long way down! Get back!” But why are people at\
    \ Skywalk in this kind of state, given their firm belief that everything is safe?\
    \ Why do they hesitate? As Tamar Gendler (2008a) puts it, there is a belief–behavior\
    \ mismatch, and this presents us with a puzzle. And the case of Skywalk is not\
    \ the only sit- uation where this kind of puzzle arises. Empirical studies have\
    \ shown that people are uncomfortable eating fudge that has been formed in the\
    \ shape of dog poop, that they are hesitant to eat soup out of a brand-new bedpan,\
    \ and that they are disinclined to drink sugar water that has been labeled “poison.\n\
