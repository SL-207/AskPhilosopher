    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ could conceive of my glass containing no hydrogen—and you could do so without\
    \ making any mistake in reasoning. There’s nothing about the concept of water\
    \ that prevents you from conceiving of hydrogen-free water. For you, such a thing\
    \ is conceptually possible. But for all that, it might be metaphysically impossi-\
    \ ble. Likewise, one might reason, perhaps a zombie world is impossible despite\
    \ being conceivable. However, the analogy between conceiving of zombies and conceiv-\
    \ ing of hydrogen-free water has been questioned. Hydrogen-free water is ideally\
    \ conceivable only if we fail to consider some of the world’s physical features,\
    \ including water’s chemical composition. By contrast, the zombie-world scenario\
    \ duplicates all of the actual world’s physical features. So, without saying more,\
    \ physicalists can’t explain the ideal conceivability of a zombie world in the\
    \ way they can explain the ideal conceivability of hydrogen-free water. But these\

    \ and McLaughlin 1999, Papineau 2002). Maybe it’s just built into phe- nomenal\
    \ concepts that consciousness is independent of physical and functional features.\
    \ If so, we should blame the ideal conceivability of a zombie world not on the\
    \ nature of phenomenal consciousness but instead on the nature of phenomenal concepts.\
    \ If the phenomenal concept strategy succeeds, then we can have our cake and eat\
