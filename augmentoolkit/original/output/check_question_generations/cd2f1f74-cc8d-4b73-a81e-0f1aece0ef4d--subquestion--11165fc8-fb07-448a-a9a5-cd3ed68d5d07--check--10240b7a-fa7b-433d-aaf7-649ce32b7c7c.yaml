    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ WITHIN BRAINS BACKGROUND According to physicalism, everything is physical. But\
    \ what does it mean to be physical? Contemporary philosophers often character-\
    \ ize the physical by deferring to physics: physical phenomena are the entities\
    \ described by fundamental physics, or those plus entities that are constructed\
    \ from them (Loewer 2001; see Chapter 21). In other words, to be physical is to\
    \ be, or to be made of, entities that exist at the fundamental level of physical\
    \ reality. For example, if quarks and lep- tons are posited by fundamental physics,\
    \ then they and the things they compose are physical. But what if there is no\
    \ fundamental level? For example, what if quarks and leptons are composed of more\
    \ basic enti- ties? And what if those more basic entities are composed of still\
    \ more basic entities, and so on forever (ad infinitum)? Physicalism shouldn’t\
    \ rule that possibility out. But how can that be avoided? Barbara Gail Montero\
    \ (2006) develops an elegant solution to the problem described above—of how to\
    \ reconcile physicalism with the possibility that there are no fundamental physical\
    \ phenomena.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"What is physicalism, and\
    \ what does it claim about the nature of reality?\"\"\"\n\nIf the question clearly\
    \ goes off the rails and is incoherent, then it is irrelevant. Be careful around\
    \ 'how' and 'why' questions."
