    \ Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not\
    \ the question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. \n\nFollowing this,\

    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ table or being a horse? Are those ever represented in visual perception? Some\
    \ think the answer is no: the categories of being a table and being a horse are\
    \ not part of your visual perceptual content, which is limited to represent- ing\
    \ low-level properties such as color and shape (e.g., Dretske 1995, Tye 1995,\
    \ Clark 2000). According to this view, high-level categories are introduced only\
    \ after perceptual processing is completed, by a different part of your cognitive\
    \ system. Susanna Siegel (2006, 2010) 35 Pine Trees and Cyrillic Text 213 disagrees.\
    \ According to what she calls the Rich Content View, high-level properties can,\
    \ and often do, figure into perceptual content. Siegel’s main argument for that\
    \ view appeals to examples of perception, in- cluding one involving pine trees\
    \ and one involving Cyrillic text. THE CASES First example: you’ve been hired\
    \ to cut down all the pine trees in a grove that contains many different sorts\
    \ of trees. You don’t know what pine trees look like. Fortunately for you (though\
    \ not for the pines), someone points out which trees are pines, and your ability\
    \ to recog- nize pine trees improves over the following weeks. Eventually, you\
    \ can spot them almost immediately. Second example: you look at a page filled\
    \ with Cyrillic text, but you can’t read Russian. To you, what’s on the page are\
    \ just meaningless squiggles and squoggles. Then you go about learning to read\
    \ Russian, and eventually you succeed. The same page, with the Cyrillic text unaltered,\
    \ looks notably different to you than it used to. When you started to learn, you\
    \ had to attend to each letter separately, but now it actually takes effort to\
    \ do that. You perceive the symbols as meaningful words and sentences. Both examples\
    \ involve a sort of experiential shift: a marked change in what it’s like for\
    \ you to perceive the same thing (a pine tree or some Cyrillic writing).\n\"\"\
