    \ Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not\
    \ the question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. \n\nFollowing this,\

    \ the question with regards to the text. \n\nNote a special exception: if a question\
    \ includes information that isn't in the paragraphs, but is clearly (DIRECTLY,\

    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ it doesn’t seem that memorization of the rulebook would be sufficient for them\
    \ to understand Mandarin. Another common response (also directed against premise\
    \ 1), often called the Robot Reply, contends that the lack of understanding results\
    \ from the fact that the system lacks any sensory organs and cannot interact with\
    \ the world (see Fodor 1980, Harnad 1991). These de- ficiencies prevent it from\
    \ being able to connect the symbols that it is manipulating to the objects and\
    \ states of affair that those symbols are meant to represent. To try to rebut\
    \ this objection, Searle suggests another modification to the original thought\
    \ experiment. Suppose we put the entire room inside the head of a giant robot.\
    \ This robot has cameras and other sensors that take input from the world, and\
    \ now some of the characters that are slipped into the room come via the cameras\
    \ and sensors. According to Searle, the fact that these sym- bols are coming from\
    \ a different source doesn’t have any effect on your understanding. You are still\
    \ just doing what you have always been ­doing—namely, manipulating symbols without\
    \ understanding what they symbolize. Searle also suggests that, in granting that\
    \ something like sensory perception is needed for understanding, the Robot Reply\
    \ tacitly concedes his conclusion: no computer can come to achieve understanding\
    \ merely in virtue of running a symbolic program con- sisting of syntactically\
    \ specified rules. A different kind of response targets the structure of Searle’s\
    \ example. Paul and Patricia Churchland (1990) propose a parallel ­argument— what\
    \ they call the Luminous Room. You inside the room are given a magnet, and told\
    \ to wave it as fast as you can. No matter how much you wave it, however, you\
    \ don’t produce any visible light. It thus looks like we could conclude that electromagnetic\
    \ forces are not sufficient to produce light.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text):\
