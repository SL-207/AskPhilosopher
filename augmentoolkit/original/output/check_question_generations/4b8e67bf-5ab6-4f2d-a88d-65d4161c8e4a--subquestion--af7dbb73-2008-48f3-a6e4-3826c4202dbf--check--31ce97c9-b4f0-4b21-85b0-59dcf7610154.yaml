    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ Cyndi. Cyndi has chromesthesia. For her, making breakfast is a very colorful\
    \ experience. When she puts the bacon into the pan and hears the sizzle, she has\
    \ a sensation of red. When she cracks an egg, she has a sensation of blue. And\
    \ when she pours orange juice into a glass, she has a sensation of green. How\
    \ are we to characterize these color experiences? Are they per- ceptual in nature?\
    \ If so, should we say that Cyndi is seeing green or hearing green? Neither of\
    \ these options seems satisfactory. On the one hand, given that colors are typically\
    \ discriminated vis- ually, it may seem tempting to say that Cyndi is seeing green\
    \ as she’s pouring the orange juice. But there is nothing green in her visual\
    \ field. Her eyes may even be closed while she is having the relevant experience.\
    \ Moreover, given that her color experience is caused by Synesthesia 219 an auditory\
    \ stimulus, it may seem odd to characterize her perceptual experience as something\
    \ that’s visual in nature. One way that we dis- tinguish auditory experiences\
    \ from visual experiences is in terms of the kinds of inputs that generate the\
    \ relevant experience. In Cyndi’s case, there is not the kind of input typical\
    \ of visual experiences. In this case, the input is auditory in nature. That suggests\
    \ that we should say she is hearing the color. And in fact, this is how synesthesia\
    \ is often described, as in neurologist Rich- ard Cytowic’s 1998 book titled,\
    \ The Man Who Tasted Shapes (see also Brang and Ramachandran 2011). But it’s not\
    \ clear how we are to make sense of the claim that colors can be heard. Given\
    \ the nature of colors, they are not the kinds of experiences that can be discrim-\
    \ inated from one another by way of auditory perception. All of their properties\
    \ are visual in nature (hue, brightness, etc.). They do not have auditory properties\
    \ (volume, tone, etc.). So, it’s hard to know how to classify Cyndi’s perceptual\
