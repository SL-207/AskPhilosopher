    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\

    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\

    \ Many, if not most, philosophers are physicalists. Those philosophers usually\
    \ believe that a complete physics would be a fully general science, leaving nothing\
    \ out. Nevertheless, many also believe that sciences with more limited domains—the\
    \ so called “special sciences” like psychology and biology—are essential to getting\
    \ a full picture of the world. The special sciences discover things physics does\
    \ not. And they help us see nature’s joints, so to speak, even if those joints\
    \ aren’t the fundamental ones. This view about the relationship between the sciences\
    \ is often reflected in beliefs about the nature of the mind. THE CASE Two popular\
    \ beliefs seem to be in tension: (1) physics is complete in the sense that everything\
    \ that happens is covered by physical law, and if you fix everything described\
    \ by physics, you fix the nature of the world as a whole; and (2) sciences such\
    \ as psychology and biology dis- cover important truths about the world that physics\
    \ does not capture. Can these views be reconciled? 13 PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND\
    \ THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 78 One reaction is concessive: the “special sciences”\
    \ are just different ways of talking about the same events, perhaps at different\
    \ levels of descriptions—zoomed out or zoomed in—or restricted to different contexts;\
    \ but physics ultimately doesn’t leave anything out.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based\
    \ on text): \"\"\"What is the relationship between the physical sciences and the\
    \ special sciences, in the view of many philosophers?\"\"\"\n\nIf the question\
