    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\

    \ useful to consider how philosophers differentiate mental states and attitudes\
    \ from one another. Take a claim like “There are some brownies in the kitchen.”\
    \ It’s possible for us to take many different mental at- titudes towards that\
    \ same content. We might believe that there are 34 The Skywalk 207 some brownies\
    \ in the kitchen, hope that there are some brownies in the kitchen, fear that\
    \ there are some brownies in the kitchen, and so on. When trying to explain the\
    \ difference between these various attitudes, philosophers of mind tend to rely\
    \ heavily on their different functional profiles. Believing that there are brownies\
    \ in the kitchen will bring about different behavior from that brought about by\
    \ fear- ing that there are brownies in the kitchen; and it also has different\
    \ connections to other mental states. Occasionally, cases arise in which we see\
    \ a person behaving in ways that don’t match the expected func- tional profile\
    \ of the mental states that we would typically see them as having. How should\
    \ such cases be accounted for? Though sometimes we might be able to account for\
    \ the behavior by reassessing which beliefs and desires (and other traditionally\
    \ recognized mental states) the person has, sometimes this does not seem adequate.\
    \ Faced with that inadequacy, another option would be to explore the addition\
    \ of a new mental state category to our traditional taxonomy. THE CASE At the\
