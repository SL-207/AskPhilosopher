    \ Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not\
    \ the question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. \n\nFollowing this,\

    \ the question with regards to the text. \n\nNote a special exception: if a question\
    \ includes information that isn't in the paragraphs, but is clearly (DIRECTLY,\

    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ and, indeed, of any physical states altogether. If this is possible, then the\
    \ particular pain under consideration cannot itself be a physical state. Contrary\
    \ to what the physicalist claims, the pain is an irreducibly mental state. In\
    \ saying that it is irreducible, Gertler means that it does not reduce to physical\
    \ states. For comparison, consider a glass of water. Arguably, the water in that\
    \ glass is nothing more than a collection of H2O molecules. In other words, the\
    \ water reduces to H2O, and H2O itself reduces to bonded hydrogen and oxygen atoms.\
    \ By contrast, ac- cording to Gertler, pain does not reduce to any physical state.\
    \ DISCUSSION A related scenario has also been posed by W. D. Hart (1988); though,\
    \ un- like Gertler, he does not focus on pain. Rather, he focuses on visualizing\
    \ The Disembodied Pain 15 oneself disembodied (see also Chapter 1). Hart moves\
    \ us slowly in im- agination from embodiment to disembodiment. You’re asked to\
    \ im- agine waking up in your usual embodied state. Before you open your eyes,\
    \ you carefully walk over to the mirror. In front of the mirror, when you raise\
    \ your eyelids, you see empty eye sockets. You then peel back the top of your\
    \ skull, and you can see that your entire skull is empty. There is no brain inside.\
    \ As you stare into the mirror, the rest of your body slowly seems to melt away.\
    \ By visualizing what you would see in the mirror once the entirety of your body\
    \ has ­disappeared, you are able to conceive of yourself in a completely disembodied\
    \ state. Again, on the assumption that whatever is conceivable is possible, we\
    \ get to the conclusion that physicalism must be false and that dualism must be\
    \ true. Arguments that rely on this assumption—that whatever is ­conceivable is\
    \ possible—are often referred to as conceivability ­arguments. Many arguments\
    \ concerning the mind–body problem and the ­nature of consciousness take this\
    \ basic form: that is, they begin with a claim about what is conceivable and move\
    \ to a claim about what is ­possible.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\
    \"Can pain occur in the complete absence of any physical states, and if so, what\
    \ does this imply about the nature of pain?\"\"\"\n\nIf the question clearly goes\
    \ off the rails and is incoherent, then it is irrelevant. Be careful around 'how'\
