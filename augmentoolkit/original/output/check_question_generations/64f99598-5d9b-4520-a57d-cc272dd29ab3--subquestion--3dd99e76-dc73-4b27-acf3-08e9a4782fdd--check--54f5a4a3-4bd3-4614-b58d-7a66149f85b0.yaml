    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\

    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ to the behavioral responses that we associate with pain. Now imagine creatures\
    \ that feel pain but whose pain is not caused in the way ours typically is—for\
    \ example, when our bodies are damaged. Instead, they feel pain only when a certain\
    \ sort of magnetic field is present—a field that does not damage their bodies.\
    \ Such creatures might also be super-spartans, in which case their pain experiences\
    \ are accompanied by neither the causes nor the effects that normally accompany\
    \ human pain. Perhaps those super-spartans nonetheless report having pain when\
    \ they have it. That is potentially significant because some behavio- rists accord\
    \ a central role to verbal expressions of mental states. That ­inspired Putnam’s\
    \ final variation on his thought experiment: the ­super-super-spartans (he also\
    \ calls them “X-worlders”), who do not even report having pain when they have\
    \ pain. Individual members of that community might have their own private way\
    \ of thinking about pain, and they might well dislike pain just as we do. But,\
    \ publicly, they are silent about it. The super-super-spartans feel pain but have\
    \ none of the dispositions we normally associate with pain. Putnam concludes that\
    \ behaviorism is false. His argument could be summarized as follows. If behaviorism\
    \ is true, then experiencing PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND\
    \ 84 pain consists in having the dispositional states normally associated with\
    \ pain (wincing, etc.). If experiencing pain consists in having those ­dispositional\
    \ states, then it’s impossible that any creatures experience pain unless their\
    \ pain is accompanied by those dispositional states. The super-super-spartans\
    \ case demonstrates that such creatures are ­possible. Therefore, behaviorism\
    \ is false. DISCUSSION Putnam’s super-spartans case premiered in his 1963 article\
    \ “Brains and Behavior.” By that time, methodological behaviorism was ­being supplanted\
    \ by cognitivist approaches in psychology, which focuses as much on inner, mental\
