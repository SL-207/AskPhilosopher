    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ Unlike Donald, Swampman has no evolutionary history. No aspect of Swampman’s\
    \ mental life can be correctly described as having co-­ varied with encounters\
    \ with green-colored objects (or with anything else). Factors that play a central\
    \ role on teleological theories are ab- sent. So, it is hard to see how those\
    \ theories could be correct. The Swampman case presents a similar challenge to\
    \ a view about consciousness known as representationalism (also known as intentional-\
    \ ism). Earlier we noted that, at least from a naturalistic perspective, it can\
    \ seem mysterious how mental states can represent (or be about) anything. We also\
    \ noted that teleological theories of content promise to dispel that mystery,\
    \ explaining mental representation in natural- istic (e.g., causal/historical)\
    \ terms. Some suggest that those theories can also dispel another widely discussed\
    \ mystery: how to explain the phenomenal, or “what it is like”, aspect of conscious\
    \ experience (Harman 1990, Dretske 1995, Tye 2000, Jackson 2003; and see Part\
    \ I). These scholars’ suggestion combines two ideas. The first is rep- resentationalism\
    \ about phenomenal character, the view that a mental state’s phenomenal character\
    \ consists entirely in its representational character—that is, in how that state\
    \ represents the world (this can include both representational content and the\
    \ way that content is rep- resented). The second is to apply teleological/co-variational\
    \ theories to the representational character in which, according to representa-\
    \ tionalism, phenomenal character consists. The idea here is to explain this representational\
    \ character in terms of naturalistic considerations about teleology and co-variation.\
    \ That suggestion might seem promising. Phenomenal character might not seem so\
    \ baffling if it can be identified with a ­phenomenon that can be explained naturalistically.\n\
