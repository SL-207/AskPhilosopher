    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\

    \ 2 might appear to be red in color or the letter D might appear to be green in\
    \ color. Though the colors associated with particular letters and numbers vary\
    \ from one synesthete to another—so the number 2 might appear red to one synesthete\
    \ and blue to another—they stay constant for a given synesthete over time. If\
    \ the number 2 appears red to a synesthete, it will always appear red to that\
    \ synesthete. Among the many other varieties of synesthesia, there is also taste-tactile\
    \ as- sociation, taste-color association, olfactory-tactile association, and visual-olfactory\
    \ association. Sometimes cases are classified as forms of 36 PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION,\
    \ AND ATTENTION 218 synesthesia even when the trigger is not sensory in nature,\
    \ as when days of the week are taken to be colored or months are taken to have\
    \ locations in space. In this chapter, we will focus on the sensory cases. Although\
    \ references to the phenomenon of synesthesia can be found as far back as the\
    \ 17th century, and though it was discussed by Francis Galton in the late 19th\
    \ century, it did not generate much sustained attention until the 1980s. Estimates\
    \ vary widely about what percentage of people have synesthesia, from well below\
    \ 1% of the population to as high as 15%, though one especially well-regarded\
    \ study reports the prevalence of synesthesia to be 4.4% (Simner et al. 2006;\
    \ for discussion see Johnson et al. 2013). The condition seems to be more common\
    \ in females than in males, though some recent stud- ies have demonstrated otherwise\
    \ (e.g., Simner et al. 2006). Synesthesia seems to run in families and seems to\
    \ be an inherited condition; but there are also some cases of acquired synesthesia,\
    \ sometimes due to neurological conditions and sometimes due to the use of hallucino-\
    \ genic drugs. Moreover, some cultures, such as the Ancient Mayan and other Mesoamerican\
    \ peoples, seem to have put great emphasis on the cultivation of cross-modal experiences\
    \ like those associated with synesthesia—an emphasis that is revealed throughout\
