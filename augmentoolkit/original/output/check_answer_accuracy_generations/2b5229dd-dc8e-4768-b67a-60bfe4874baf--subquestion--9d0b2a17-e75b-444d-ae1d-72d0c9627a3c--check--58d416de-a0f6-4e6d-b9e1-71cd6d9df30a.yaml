- content: 'Text: """” In the empirical literature, phenomena such as these are often
    treated as cases of “sympathetic magic” (Rozin et al. 1986). Let’s flesh out the
    details of the last example. Study participants saw an experimenter open a commercially
    labe- led box of sugar and pour some of it into two clean, empty bottles. They
    were then given two labels—one that said “sucrose” and one that said “sodium cyanide,
    poison”—and instructed to stick one to each bottle. The participants watched while
    water from the same source was poured into two glasses, and they also saw some
    powder from the bottle marked “poison” mixed into one glass and some powder from
    the bottle marked “sucrose” mixed into the other glass. Following all of this,
    participants were asked to rate how willing they were to take a sip from each
    glass, and the results showed a significant preference for the bottle that was
    labeled “sucrose”—even though participants acknowledged that they knew there was
    no poison in either glass, and that both glasses contained the same sugar water
    (Rozin et al. 1986). How do we account for these cases? It doesn’t look like an
    instance of contradictory beliefs. People at Skywalk don’t seem to have the The
    Skywalk 209 belief “It’s not safe” alongside their belief “It’s safe.” And it’s
    hard to see how people in the sugar water experiment would believe “There’s poison
    in this glass.” Do they merely imagine that Skywalk is unsafe or that there’s
    poison in the glass? The problem with this suggestion is that imaginings tend
    to be quarantined off from real-life belief and ac- tion. As Gendler puts it,
    imagination is like Las Vegas—what happens in imagination stays in imagination
    (2008b, p. 568). DISCUSSION In Gendler’s view, the best way to resolve the puzzle
    is to postulate the existence of a novel mental state—what she calls alief. Alief
    is a state that is associative, automatic, and arational. It is not reducible
    to belief or other mental states/attitudes."""
