    Otherwise, they’re only potentially seen. DISCUSSION Does change blindness (or
    inattentional blindness) really show that perceptual experience is sparse? Some
    think so (Blackmore et al. 1995, Rensink et al. 1997, Simons 1997, O’Regan and
    Noë 2001, Tye 2009). But others do not (Dretske 2007, Block 2007, 2012). How can
    we decide? Some issues can be resolved empirically. For example, consider experimental
    results such as the following (Fernandez-Duque and Thornton 2000). Subjects are
    first shown pairs of pictures that look identical to them (in the way drawings
    A and B look to you at first). Then they do a forced-choice task of selecting
    those pairs where there is a change. In other words, they are told to choose which
    pairs aren’t identical, even though they say all pairs look identical. They success-
    fully identify the non-identical pairs at above-chance levels. This indi- cates
    that it’s probably incorrect to say that your visual system doesn’t register or
    represent the things in the visual that you don’t notice. And Change Blindness
    227 so it’s probably misleading to say, without qualification, that you’re literally
    blind to those things—that, for example, Sarah doesn’t visually perceive Sam in
    any sense. But that doesn’t settle the issue of whether Sarah consciously perceives
    Sam. It’s consistent with the results of the forced-choice experiments that Sarah
    perceives Sam unconsciously, and that to see him consciously would require her
    focusing attention on him—at least enough for her to ask “Who (or what) is that?”
    Michael Tye defends that position. In his view, consciously seeing is less like
    taking a photograph than like draw- ing a picture. He writes: “At a conscious
    level, a constructive process operates that is something like drawing a picture.
    … It is not like taking a clear, color photograph. It leaves things out” (2009,
    p."""
