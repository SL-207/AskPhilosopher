- content: 'Text: """ Nowadays, cognitive science and neuroscience are progressing
    at ever-increasing rates. So much so that, though there remains much to learn,
    it might seem all but inevitable that a scientific explanation of consciousness
    is forthcoming. Former mysteries, including some about life itself, are mysteries
    no longer. Why should consciousness be any different? In fact, there may be a
    reason. Some argue that consciousness presents an especially perplexing difficulty,
    which David J. Chalmers (1995) calls the hard problem of consciousness. We use
    terms like “conscious” and “consciousness” in different ways. For example, sometimes
    we want to mark the distinction between being awake and being asleep, as in 4
    The Hard Problem of Consciousness 19 “I lost consciousness the minute my head
    hit the pillow.” Sometimes we want to indicate awareness, as in: “Yes, I am fully
    conscious that my socks have holes in them.” And sometimes we mean subjective
    experience, such as the pain of arthritis, the visual experience of see- ing a
    red rose, or the existential angst one might feel while contem- plating Sartre’s
    reflections on death. What unites such diverse states is that there is something
    it’s like to have them (Nagel 1974; see Chapter 5). It is this last sort of consciousness—the
    “what-it’s-like” sort, also known as phenomenal consciousness—that the hard problem
    concerns. In this chapter, we’ll refer to that aspect of consciousness simply
    as “experience.” THE CASE At the moment, my elbow hurts. We know from science
    that my pain experience, along with all of my other experiences, happens as a
    result of brain processes. For each of us, our brain creates a subjective inner
    life, rich with pains, pleasures, images, moods, etc. But how does that happen?
    Our brains are continuously processing information acquired from our senses. Why
    is this information processing accompanied by experiences? Why doesn’t the brain’s
    activity go on in the dark, so to speak?"""
