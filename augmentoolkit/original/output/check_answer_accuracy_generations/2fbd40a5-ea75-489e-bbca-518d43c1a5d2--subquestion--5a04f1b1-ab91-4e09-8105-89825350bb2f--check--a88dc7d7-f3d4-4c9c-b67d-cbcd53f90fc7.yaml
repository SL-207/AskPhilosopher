- content: 'Text: """ Someone studying only physics would predict all of the movements
    of the subatomic activity that underlies the organism’s behavior—its attempt to
    get out of danger. But they would miss what causes that behavior, and would probably
    fail to understand that there was behavior—as opposed to mere physical motions—in
    the first place. The Puzzle of the Special Sciences 79 Although psychology neither
    talks about anything non-physical nor contravenes the laws of physics, it is an
    autonomous science all the same. Some (such as Fodor himself, and many of the
    non-reductive materialists mentioned in the previous chapter) draw a moral for
    the philosophy of mind: mental states are physical states, but they are not identical
    to those states (and cannot be reduced to them) because they are governed by distinct
    laws. DISCUSSION Probably the most influential counterpoint to Fodor’s picture
    of the special sciences comes from Jaegwon Kim (1992). Kim finds some- thing suspicious
    about Fodor’s story in “Special Sciences.” The story, in Kim’s view, depends on
    claiming that there is a law in the ­special sciences but no corresponding law
    in the physical sciences. Kim ­questions this assumption: Why not take the special-sciences
    law to be a law in physical science? Staying with the economics analogy, Fodor’s
    answer might seem obvious: units of currency are not physical kinds like quarks,
    charge, mass, etc. But that seemingly obvious answer itself raises questions.
    Granted, any particular instance of currency is realized by something physical
    (paper, copper, electrons, etc.), but the kind itself is not physical. One might
    wonder, though, why there can’t be a disjunctive kind: “P1 or P2 or P3 or P4”—where
    P1 is the physical basis of paper money, P2 of copper money, P3 of digital currency,
    and so on? Though it’s a disjunctive kind, it involves only physical terms. So,
    why isn’t it a physical kind that can be included in physical laws?"""
