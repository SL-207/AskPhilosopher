- content: 'Text: """ To understand how such a challenge arises, it will be useful
    to consider how philosophers differentiate mental states and attitudes from one
    another. Take a claim like “There are some brownies in the kitchen.” It’s possible
    for us to take many different mental at- titudes towards that same content. We
    might believe that there are 34 The Skywalk 207 some brownies in the kitchen,
    hope that there are some brownies in the kitchen, fear that there are some brownies
    in the kitchen, and so on. When trying to explain the difference between these
    various attitudes, philosophers of mind tend to rely heavily on their different
    functional profiles. Believing that there are brownies in the kitchen will bring
    about different behavior from that brought about by fear- ing that there are brownies
    in the kitchen; and it also has different connections to other mental states.
    Occasionally, cases arise in which we see a person behaving in ways that don’t
    match the expected func- tional profile of the mental states that we would typically
    see them as having. How should such cases be accounted for? Though sometimes we
    might be able to account for the behavior by reassessing which beliefs and desires
    (and other traditionally recognized mental states) the person has, sometimes this
    does not seem adequate. Faced with that inadequacy, another option would be to
    explore the addition of a new mental state category to our traditional taxonomy.
    THE CASE At the west rim of the Grand Canyon, on the Hualapai Reservation in Peach
    Springs, Arizona, is a remarkable glass bridge that was erected in 2007. This
    bridge, the Grand Canyon Skywalk, consists of more than 1 million pounds of steel
    and 83,000 points of glass, and in total it weighs 1.2 million pounds. Its foundation
    is strong enough to support approximately 71 million pounds. At 4000 feet high,
