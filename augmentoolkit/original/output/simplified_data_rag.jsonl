Chapter 47 turns from questions about self-introspection to questions about self-reference, objectivity, and self-awareness. The final three chapters in this section turn to questions about the essence of persons and the self. Chapter 48 considers a thought experiment designed to show that the origins of a person are es- sential to that person’s identity. Chapter 49 considers which kinds of characteristics are especially salient towards making a person the person that they are. Finally, Chapter 50 explores how cases involving transformative decisions raise problems for a person’s ability to stay true to themselves. DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-45 THE PRINCE AND THE COBBLER BACKGROUND Although philosophers have been grappling with issues relating to personal identity at least as far back as Plato, these issues came in for renewed scrutiny in the 17th century via the work of John Locke. Ad- dressing the topic in a chapter entitled “Of Identity and Diversity” in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689), Locke took up two inter-related questions: First, what is the nature of persons? And, second, what accounts for a person’s identity over time? Our interest in this chapter is the second question, and the issue of personal iden- tity over time is now often referred to as the problem of personal identity. Philosophers working on this problem have typically split into three broad camps. Those who defend the soul theory suggest that a person’s identity over time consists in the continued existence of the same soul. Those who defend the psychological theory suggest that a person’s identity over time consists in psychological facts. Those who defend the physical theory suggest that a person’s identity over time consists in physical facts.\nYou are an AI domain expert.

Philosophers working on this problem have broadly been categorized into three camps. Let me explain them to you:\n\n1. **The soul theory**, which suggests that a person's identity over time consists in the continued existence of the same soul. This idea posits that the essence of a person is their immaterial component, not their physical body.\n\n2. **The psychological theory**, which suggests that a person's identity over time consists in psychological facts, such as memories, experiences, and personality traits. This perspective sees personal identity as tied to our mental states and consciousness.\n\n3. **The physical theory**, which suggests that a person's identity over time consists in physical facts, such as their bodily continuity and physical characteristics. This camp sees personal identity as tied to our physical existence.\n\nThese camps represent some of the main philosophical perspectives on the problem of personal identity.

After the swap, viewers find it natural to identify the person in the teenage body as the mother and the person in the older body as the daughter. Despite the intuitive appeal of the memory theory, it has often come in for criticism. One influential criticism, offered in the 18th century by Thomas Reid (1785), proceeds by way of a thought experiment involv- ing a brave army officer. While fighting in an important campaign, this officer saves his entire unit and is awarded a prestigious medal. Though the officer is now highly respected, he was something of a miscreant as a young boy. In particular, he remembers an incident in which he stole some apples from his neighbor’s tree. As the officer ages, he becomes a general, and then retires. In retirement, he gradually becomes more and more senile, and, at a certain point, the retired general can remember winning the medal but can no longer remember stealing the apples or The Prince and the Cobbler 243 anything else from that time of his life. As Reid notes, Locke’s theory now gives us a paradoxical result. To simplify, let’s refer to the retired general as RG, the army officer as AO, and the young boy as YB. Since RG can remember experiences of AO, RG is identical to AO. Since AO can remember experiences of YB, AO is identical to YB. According to the transitivity of identity, if A is identical to B and B is identical to C, then A is identical to C. Putting this together with the two prior claims, we get the result that RG is identical to YB. But, since RG has no memories of the experiences of YB, and since Locke’s memory theory requires such memory connections for personal identity, we also get the result that RG is not identical to YB. Thus, Locke’s memory theory seems to result in a contradiction.

I might know that I have a cold without under- standing that it is a virus, and could thus imagine having the cold in a world where there were no viruses. Really, though, my imagination is misleading because I don’t know all the relevant facts. Similarly, the soul might in fact be bodily, but the awareness the floating man has of the soul simply doesn’t reveal that fact. Avicenna will respond that, unlike the case of my virus confusion, the floating man fully grasps his own essence. If he can have a com- plete grasp of his essence without needing to think of himself as em- bodied, his essence does not include embodiment. This, though, only raises the question of why we should think the floating man fully grasps his own essence (Adamson and Benevich 2018, pp. 158, 160). It could be that, in his peculiar situation, the floating man is given only a superficial grasp of his own nature and that a more complete grasp would show that he must be embodied. Some philosophers in the latter half of the 13th century (e.g. ­Matthew of Aquasparta and Vital du Four) backed off of Avicen- na’s metaphysical conclusion, and instead argued that the case of the ­floating man revealed something special about self-awareness. Even if one must in fact be embodied, one can be aware of oneself without being aware of the body and without having any sensory experience whatsoever (Toivanen 2015, pp. 80–86). But even that epistemological conclusion could be challenged. One could maintain in response that the floating man is aware of his body; he just isn’t aware of it as his body.

If we accept this explanation, however, then we admit that qualia have a relational profile, and we would thus have to deny that they are intrinsic. This presents yet a further departure from the traditional conception of qualia. DISCUSSION Dennett takes the coffee tasters thought experiment to reveal a deep incoherence in the traditional conception of qualia. We can’t really know what qualia we’re having, and we can’t really separate qualia from our reactions to them. In his view, the very notion of qualia is so thor- oughly confused that it should be retired from philosophical discussion. In rejecting the traditional notion of qualia, Dennett endorses a philosophical view known as eliminativism (or sometimes eliminative materialism). According to eliminativists, our ordinary and intuitive understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and misguided. To defend this point, eliminativists often draw a comparison to our ordinary and intuitive understanding of physics. There are deep mistakes interwo- ven throughout our intuitive conception of physics (often called folk physics)—for example, the idea that a heavier ball falls faster than a lighter one. Likewise, eliminativists say, there are also deep mistakes interwoven throughout our intuitive conception of the mind (often called folk psychology). In rejecting and replacing folk theories, we dis- card the mistaken posits of the theory. Thus, given that many of our mental state categories are posits of folk psychology, it shouldn’t be surprising that they too need to be discarded as we come to develop a more sophisticated and scientific theory of mind. Early eliminativists tended to focus on mental states like beliefs and desires (see, e.g., Churchland 1981). More recently, many philosophers of an eliminativist bent have turned their attention to consciousness and have developed a view that’s come to be known as illusionism (Frankish 2016, Kammerer 2021).\nAnswer questions according to your knowledge."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I'm reading about a concept called the \"zombie world\" - essentially, a world that's identical to our own but lacks consciousness.

According to Davidson, no element of meaning can be a private matter, to which an individual speaker has privileged access—even when it comes to the words that she herself CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 144 uses on a particular occasion. Instead, meaning (semantics) is a function of only publicly observable facts. And, plausibly enough, the publicly observable facts might not determine that when I say “rabbit” I mean rabbit rather than rabbit stage. But once again, that leaves us with a choice. We could accept that meaning and reference are indeterminate, and concede that this is true even of one’s own words. Or we could take Davidson’s reasoning to show that his starting assumption, that meaning is a function of only publicly observable facts, is false. The choice has consequences. If we make the latter choice, reject- ing the bases for Quinean indeterminacy doctrines, then we take the first-person perspective of individual speakers to play some vital role in determining meaning (Kripke 1977, Searle 1983). And it is not entirely clear what that role is. If we make the former choice, siding with Quine and Davidson, then different questions arise.

The Puzzle of the Special Sciences 79 Although psychology neither talks about anything non-physical nor contravenes the laws of physics, it is an autonomous science all the same. Some (such as Fodor himself, and many of the non-reductive materialists mentioned in the previous chapter) draw a moral for the philosophy of mind: mental states are physical states, but they are not identical to those states (and cannot be reduced to them) because they are governed by distinct laws.

One might wonder, though, why there can’t be a disjunctive kind: “P1 or P2 or P3 or P4”—where P1 is the physical basis of paper money, P2 of copper money, P3 of digital currency, and so on?

For example, ordi- narily we do not think that what we refer to with our words is always indeterminate—as in the example noted above, where I seem to refer determinately to my friend Smith and the property of being tall with the words “Smith” and “is tall.” But appearances can be deceiving, and in this case, according to Quine, they are. Quine’s indeterminacy doctrine has been highly influential. There has also been considerable push-back. Some criticize his argument. One well-known criticism is due to Noam Chomsky (1968). Quine’s CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 142 reasoning begins with a premise about underdetermination: the evi- dence you gather when you observe the tribe member’s reaction to the rabbit doesn’t determine which of your empirical hypotheses about the meaning of “Gavagai!” is correct. But, as Chomsky argues, from that premise, Quine’s indeterminacy doctrine simply does not follow. Empirical hypotheses always go beyond the evidence. There are always multiple, inconsistent empirical hypotheses that are consistent with any set of observations. For example, there is an underdetermination by the evidence that physicists consider when they formulate empirical hy- potheses. It does not follow that there is no fact of the matter regarding which hypothesis is correct. Likewise, according to Chomsky, in the case of linguistic meaning, Quine’s premise—that the observable, em- pirical facts are consistent with multiple hypotheses about meaning— does not entail his indeterminacy of meaning doctrine.

Perhaps the same is true of the brain (Searle 1983, pp. 267–8).

This brings the argument closer in some ways to more contemporary conceivability arguments, such as the zombie argument discussed in Chapter 7. But it could again be objected that we simply don’t have a sufficient grasp of how the activity of material things generates thoughts or perceptions.

Material movements concern how things operate in space and time, while consciousness is about how things feel—what it’s like for the being that has conscious experiences. It’s not clear why, no matter how complicated the movement, material operations should feel like anything.

Some knowledge:\n DISCUSSION Among the many puzzles that synesthesia presents, one concerns the nature of sense perception and the individuation of the senses. How can we make sense of an experience’s being visual in nature rather than auditory or rather than tactile? Some philosophers try to dis- tinguish the senses by way of the sensory organ used; some try to distinguish them in terms of typical (and often proprietary) stimuli. But both of these ways of doing so are challenged by the case of synesthesia. Cyndi need not be using her eyes to “see” red when the bacon sizzles. Moreover, the stimulus she actually senses (the sound of sizzling bacon) is proprietary to audition, while color is proprietary to vision. In response to this puzzle, some researchers have suggested that we need to rethink the way we differentiate the senses from one an- other. Generally speaking, for example, discussions of the senses treat them as relatively discrete systems. As noted by Brian Keeley, “it is common to assume that the different senses are significantly separate and independent of one another” (2002, p. 25). Synesthesia calls this assumption into question. If we were to drop this assumption, then synesthesia would no longer be as puzzling. Dropping this assumption would also enable us to provide a better account of other puzzling phenomena, such as the McGurk effect—a phenomenon in which the same syllable is heard differently depending on the visual input one is having. For example, when one looks at a face making the typ- ical mouth movements associated with “Fa,” one will hear the syllable “Ba” as “Fa”. On this kind of response to the puzzle of synesthesia, rather than thinking of synesthesia as a case where the senses have gotten “cross-wired,” perhaps we should conceive of the senses as not being separately wired in the first place.

If we accept this explanation, however, then we admit that qualia have a relational profile, and we would thus have to deny that they are intrinsic. This presents yet a further departure from the traditional conception of qualia. DISCUSSION Dennett takes the coffee tasters thought experiment to reveal a deep incoherence in the traditional conception of qualia. We can’t really know what qualia we’re having, and we can’t really separate qualia from our reactions to them. In his view, the very notion of qualia is so thor- oughly confused that it should be retired from philosophical discussion. In rejecting the traditional notion of qualia, Dennett endorses a philosophical view known as eliminativism (or sometimes eliminative materialism). According to eliminativists, our ordinary and intuitive understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and misguided. To defend this point, eliminativists often draw a comparison to our ordinary and intuitive understanding of physics. There are deep mistakes interwo- ven throughout our intuitive conception of physics (often called folk physics)—for example, the idea that a heavier ball falls faster than a lighter one. Likewise, eliminativists say, there are also deep mistakes interwoven throughout our intuitive conception of the mind (often called folk psychology). In rejecting and replacing folk theories, we dis- card the mistaken posits of the theory. Thus, given that many of our mental state categories are posits of folk psychology, it shouldn’t be surprising that they too need to be discarded as we come to develop a more sophisticated and scientific theory of mind. Early eliminativists tended to focus on mental states like beliefs and desires (see, e.g., Churchland 1981).

Indeed, his conclusion might seem inevitable unless one considers consciousness subjectively, from the inside—that is, from the first-­ person perspective.

One option is to regard consciousness as a fundamental fea- ture of the universe, alongside the basic posits of physics such as mass and charge. Assuming that mass, charge, etc. are, unlike consciousness, non-mental features; this results in what Chalmers calls naturalistic dual- ism. But Chalmers is open to other options as well, ­including a view he later dubs “Russellian monism” (1997), in reference to the English phi- losopher Bertrand Russell. According to Russellian monism, although there is again an “extra ingredient” to the universe—something that physical science, as we know it, fails to reveal—that extra ingredient need not be experiential. Instead, it might be “proto-experiential” (or “proto-phenomenal”). On Russellian monism, such proto-­experiential properties underlie mass, charge, and the other basic properties physics describes (Alter and Pereboom 2023). Other responses are critical of Chalmers’s position. Some deny that there really is a hard problem in addition to the so-called easy prob- lems.

Leibniz found materialism, with what he took to be its mechanistic underpinnings, inadequate to explain perception and thought. Some of his reasons had to do with his other philosophical commitments. But the thought experiment of the mill appears to be an attempt to independently motivate the rejection of materialism. Leibniz’s argument can be seen as a precur- sor to more contemporary arguments that structure and dynamics ­cannot explain phenomenal consciousness (see Chapter 4), as well as to Searle’s Chinese Room argument (see Chapter 18). THE CASE According to the materialist, the mind is ultimately a physical ma- chine. Thinking, perception, and consciousness are just results of the machine’s operation. Imagine such a machine—perhaps the brain— being enlarged to the point that we could walk inside it and see the movements of the parts, just as we can walk into a mill and see the CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 10 rotations of the wheel and grindstones. Although we can easily see how these movements produce other movements or generate physi- cal activity, nothing about the workings of a machine would suggest the existence of thoughts or perceptions. No matter how much we analyze the movements of the mill’s inner parts, and no matter how much we understand about the physics of the situation, there would be no reason to think there were things like thoughts or perceptions. Their existence would seem to be something beyond what we can conclude from our understanding of the material workings of the mill.\nYou are an AI domain expert.

Parallel reasoning has also been used to challenge representation- alism. On representationalism, phenomenal properties are identified with (or at least supervene on) representational properties—properties of representing the world (Harman 1990, Chalmers 2004). Further, on significant versions of this view, representational properties are them- selves characterized in functional, causal, and historical terms (Dretske 1995, Lycan 1996, Tye 2000).

Criticisms of this thought experiment often point to the role that memory seems to be playing in Dennett’s discussion. For example, Ned Block (1995) sug- gests that Chase and Sanborn’s mistakes are all traceable to problems with their memories of qualia. But when defenders of the traditional conception of qualia suggest that qualia are meant to be directly ap- prehensible, that is meant to apply to current qualitative experience. The fact that we might incorrectly remember the precise qualitative nature of past qualitative experiences does not show that the notion of qualia is confused. A related criticism of Dennett’s discussion suggests that he has in- terpreted the notion of direct and immediate apprehensibility too strongly.

When I tell you that I’ve gone to the bank, you might wonder whether I went to a financial insti- tution or to a river. Also, some ordinary terms are vague, e.g., “tall” and “bald.” Even so, often what we say would seem to have deter- minate meaning. For example, suppose I say of my friend Smith, “Smith is tall.” Here “Smith” refers to my friend, even though there are many others who go by the name “Smith.” Also, here “is tall” refers to the property of being tall, even if there is no precise mini- mal height required for being tall. Such claims might seem obviously true—perhaps too obvious to bother stating. Not according to Wil- lard Van Orman Quine. According to Quine, such claims are actually false. In his view, understanding linguistic meaning requires analyzing language from an objective, scientific viewpoint. And that, he holds, involves setting aside our pre-theoretical intuitions about meaning and instead focusing only on objective facts. For example, in the case of translating unknown languages into one’s own language, those ob- jective facts include only dispositions to exhibit verbal behavior in response to external stimuli. As Quine (1987, p. 5) writes: “There is nothing in linguistic meaning … beyond what is to be gleaned from 23 CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 140 overt behavior in observable circumstances.” The results of Quine’s influential analysis are startling.

So, even though in humans belief roles are played by physical states and processes, being a belief is not iden- tical with some type of physical state or process. The non-reductive physicalist faces the exclusion problem no less than the dualist: as long as mental properties are distinct from a set of properties that can do all the causal work, they would seem to be epiphenomenal with respect to the physical world, lacking physical efficacy of their own. DISCUSSION Although the exclusion problem applies to both dualism and non-­ reductive physicalism, these different camps tend to offer different responses to the problem. The non-reductive physicalist, but not the dualist, can take advantage of the fact that mental properties bear very The Exclusion Problem 73 close relations to physical properties.

{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": " Beliefs and desires are characterized by these differences in direction of fit. Other states seem to differ in this way as well. Perceptions aim to fit the world, but intentions aim to make the world fit them. DISCUSSION Though there is clearly something suggestive about Anscombe’s ex- ample and the resulting notion of directions of fit, it has proved to be a little difficult to spell out. One famous interpretation and applica- tion of direction of fit comes from Michael Smith (1994), who uses it to provide a functionalist account of beliefs and desires. On Smith’s model, somewhat roughly: a belief is that p is a state that tends to go out of existence when there is a perception that not-p, while a desire is that p is a state that endures despite that perception, and leads the subject to try to bring it about that p (see also Velleman 2000, p. 115.). This is a descriptive account of what makes beliefs and desires the states that they are. But there are a number of worries about this ac- count, not least that beliefs don’t always go out of existence in the face of disagreeing perceptions. Some beliefs are stubborn. For example, a mother might believe her son is innocent despite mountains of evi- dence that he is not. And some perceptions are properly disregarded. CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 180 For example, the (illusory) perception that the stick in water is bent has no effect on my belief to the contrary (Sobel and Copp 2001, Frost 2014). A natural suggestion here is that the direction of fit contrast is not meant to capture how beliefs and desires as a matter a fact behave, but how they should behave. Anscombe’s presentation of the case suggests that she might have something normative like this in mind. Crudely, one might say a subject’s beliefs should represent the world—a sub- ject should believe p only if it is true. And desires make normative demands on how the subject should interact with the world—if S desires that p, S should try to bring it about that p.\nYou are an AI domain expert.

The notion is often characterized in terms of “aboutness” or “directedness.” For example, my belief that Mike Trout plays for the Los Angeles Angels is about a particular person, Mike Trout, and a certain state of affairs—his playing for that particular baseball team.

Inverted Qualia 119 Some functionalists respond by denying that inverted qualia are possible (Harman 1982, Lycan 1987). But not all do. Sidney Shoe- maker (1975, 1982) argues instead that the possibility of inverted qualia can be reconciled with functionalism, if functionalism is com- bined with the physicalist view that functional properties are realized in us by brain states. In his view, while the general property of having a conscious experience is a functional property, any specific phenom- enal property we have, such as phenomenal redness, is a neurophysi- ological property. But that strategy faces a problem. As we have seen, the possibility of inverted qualia threatens not just functionalism but physicalism as well (Chalmers 1996). Another noteworthy inversion case is known as Inverted Earth ­(Harman 1982, Block 1990). Inverted Earth differs from Earth in only two ways. First, everything there has the complementary color of its Earthly counterpart. The sky is yellow, ripe bananas are blue, grass is red, fire hydrants are green, etc. Second, the language is inverted. The English-speaking inhabitants describe the sky’s color as “blue,” the color of ripe bananas as “yellow,” etc. Now imagine that evil scientists knock you unconscious, insert color-inverted lenses on your eyes, and transport you to Inverted Earth, where you are substituted for your counterpart. Inverted Earth seems to pose a problem for representationalism, on which qualia are identified with representational properties. When you first wake up on Inverted Earth, everything looks normal to you; the lenses reverse the inverted colors. In terms of qualia, there is no in- version.

Color, for example, is particular to vision—someone without vision could not acquire the idea of color. Shape, on the other hand, appears to be an idea we can get both from vision—by seeing the outline of a body—and from touch— by feeling the edges of a body. Relatedly, Aristotle held that some qual- ities are perceivable only by a single sense—again, only vision perceives color, only hearing perceives sound, etc.—while other qualities are “common sensibles” and can be perceived by multiple senses; again, shape is a paradigm case, but size, number, and motion are arguably others. What, though, is the relationship between the different sensory representations of these common sensibles? What is the ­relationship between the visual perception of shape and the tactile perception of shape? This is the issue that gives rise to Molyneux’s problem. THE CASE Suppose someone has been blind since birth. Through touch, they learn how to distinguish between a cube and a sphere. They feel the 30 PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 186 corners of the cube and its six faces. They notice the stark contrast between that and the smooth feeling of the sphere.

{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": "You are an AI with vast knowledge. Here is some potentially-relevant context:\n This question was initially proposed to John Locke in a letter from William Molyneux in 1688, though there are historical antecedents in both Lucretius and Ibn Tufayl (Ferretti and Glenney 2021, Scalas 2021, Goodman 2021). Throughout the many centuries of ­discussion, a number of modifications and refinements have been made to ­Molyneux’s problem (Van Cleve 2007). Diderot suggested it would be better to ask if the subject could visually identify a circle versus a square to avoid problems of depth perception. Leibniz suggested that the subject be told that one of the items being displayed is the cube and the other is the sphere, and be given time to work out which is which. As this suggests, there are really two different questions one might ask: first, whether the person could know immediately by sight alone which was the cube and which the sphere; and, second, whether the information provided by sight, combined with the information recalled from touch, could be used to reason to the correct ­conclusion. The various refinements and interpretations of the problem have led some philosophers to divide it into a group of sub-problems (Mat- then and Cohen 2020). For example, there are questions about the relationship between the way sensory modalities represent space more generally, as well as questions about how vision and touch represent shape (Evans 1985). There are also questions about the relationships between the properties represented by touch and by vision—whether they are in fact the same property. DISCUSSION In its original presentation, Molyneux’s problem was considered a thought experiment, to be answered by philosophical theories of per- ception and the source of ideas. But the question he asked Locke seems to be an empirical one that can potentially be answered by experiment.

But for many, such as Jerry Fodor in “Special Sciences” (1974), this concessive reaction is incorrect. According to Fodor, it underestimates the sense in which sciences such as psychology really do discover new laws—interesting, predictively important, and coun- terfactually robust generalizations—that are not present in the laws of physics. Just as important, the special sciences discover unified types of phenomena that relate to each other in a lawlike manner. Though Fodor’s main concern is psychology, a consideration of economics makes things particularly plain. Consider the law that, other things being equal, prices are higher if there is more money in the economy. If this is true, it’s not because of the physical stuff money is made of. Bits of currency can be made of paper, coins, or entries in electronic ledgers, all of which have dramatically different physical properties. The law of economics holds despite the diversity of these physical properties. While no law of physics is ever broken in economic transactions, the laws of economics are independent of physical laws. Someone who could see only physical properties and ­interactions probably wouldn’t even know there was an economy, much less understand why prices were suddenly high! The same thing is true of the laws of psychology. Beliefs and ­desires can be made of different physical things. In extreme cases, perhaps between androids and humans, some beliefs could be ­carbon based and others silicon based. But even among animals there is certainly no guarantee—or need for a guarantee—that the same neural or ­subatomic activity is going on in two creatures with the same ­beliefs.

In particular, it is widely taken to imply that consciousness supervenes on physical phenomena: any world that is exactly like the actual world in all physical respects (and contains nothing else) must be exactly like the actual world with respect to consciousness. That physicalist super- venience claim runs into a challenge from zombies: hypothetical crea- tures that are exactly like conscious human beings in all physical (and functional) respects, but that lack consciousness entirely. The zombie challenge was presented by Robert Kirk (see Kirk and Squires 1974, pp. 135–52) and popularized by David J. Chalmers (1996). THE CASE Here is how to imagine your zombie twin.

{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": "You are a helpful AI assistant. Some knowledge:\n” In the empirical literature, phenomena such as these are often treated as cases of “sympathetic magic” (Rozin et al. 1986). Let’s flesh out the details of the last example. Study participants saw an experimenter open a commercially labe- led box of sugar and pour some of it into two clean, empty bottles. They were then given two labels—one that said “sucrose” and one that said “sodium cyanide, poison”—and instructed to stick one to each bottle. The participants watched while water from the same source was poured into two glasses, and they also saw some powder from the bottle marked “poison” mixed into one glass and some powder from the bottle marked “sucrose” mixed into the other glass. Following all of this, participants were asked to rate how willing they were to take a sip from each glass, and the results showed a significant preference for the bottle that was labeled “sucrose”—even though participants acknowledged that they knew there was no poison in either glass, and that both glasses contained the same sugar water (Rozin et al. 1986). How do we account for these cases? It doesn’t look like an instance of contradictory beliefs. People at Skywalk don’t seem to have the The Skywalk 209 belief “It’s not safe” alongside their belief “It’s safe.” And it’s hard to see how people in the sugar water experiment would believe “There’s poison in this glass.” Do they merely imagine that Skywalk is unsafe or that there’s poison in the glass? The problem with this suggestion is that imaginings tend to be quarantined off from real-life belief and ac- tion. As Gendler puts it, imagination is like Las Vegas—what happens in imagination stays in imagination (2008b, p. 568). DISCUSSION In Gendler’s view, the best way to resolve the puzzle is to postulate the existence of a novel mental state—what she calls alief.

{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": " The individual now constitutes the entire system, but it doesn’t seem that memorization of the rulebook would be sufficient for them to understand Mandarin. Another common response (also directed against premise 1), often called the Robot Reply, contends that the lack of understanding results from the fact that the system lacks any sensory organs and cannot interact with the world (see Fodor 1980, Harnad 1991). These de- ficiencies prevent it from being able to connect the symbols that it is manipulating to the objects and states of affair that those symbols are meant to represent. To try to rebut this objection, Searle suggests another modification to the original thought experiment. Suppose we put the entire room inside the head of a giant robot. This robot has cameras and other sensors that take input from the world, and now some of the characters that are slipped into the room come via the cameras and sensors. According to Searle, the fact that these sym- bols are coming from a different source doesn’t have any effect on your understanding. You are still just doing what you have always been ­doing—namely, manipulating symbols without understanding what they symbolize. Searle also suggests that, in granting that something like sensory perception is needed for understanding, the Robot Reply tacitly concedes his conclusion: no computer can come to achieve understanding merely in virtue of running a symbolic program con- sisting of syntactically specified rules. A different kind of response targets the structure of Searle’s example. Paul and Patricia Churchland (1990) propose a parallel ­argument— what they call the Luminous Room. You inside the room are given a magnet, and told to wave it as fast as you can. No matter how much you wave it, however, you don’t produce any visible light.

Even so, important critiques of functionalism and related views could be seen as variations on a Putnamian theme. For example, consider Galen Strawson’s (1994) weather watchers: sentient, intelligent creatures that are rooted in the ground and profoundly interested in the local weather. They have sensations, emotions, thoughts, etc. But their physiology pre- vents them from behaving. Strawson claims such imaginary creatures are possible, and that this possibility refutes neobehaviorism: the view that the nature of almost all, if not all, mental states is constitutively linked to behavior. Mainstream functionalism could be classified as neobe- haviorist since, on mainstream functionalism, behavioral dispositions figure into the very nature of mental states. Strawson’s case would seem to mirror Putnam’s cases, in which some creatures have mental states of the same sort we humans have but lack relevant (or all) behavioral components.

Some knowledge:\n Consideration of any inner mechanisms underlying ­behavioral ­dispositions fell outside the scope of the behaviorist par- adigm. ­During that same period, a corresponding view was widely discussed in ­philosophy (Carnap 1932, Hempel 1935, Ryle 1949). Philosophical ­behaviorism does not concern methodology. Instead, its central thesis is that ­mental states consist in behavioral ­dispositions. The relevant ­behavioral ­dispositions might be highly complex, but the ­implication is that the mental is nothing over and above the ­dispositional. Prior to Putnam’s (1963) super-spartans argument, the debate about ­philosophical ­behaviorism focused largely on whether the meaning of statements containing mentalistic terms—such as “belief” and “pain”—can be adequately characterized in terms of statements ­describing behavioral dispositions (Chisholm 1957, Geach 1957). Putnam regarded such issues, which are linguistic and con- ceptual, as peripheral to behaviorism’s central thesis, which is about 14 The Super-Spartans 83 mental states themselves: about pain rather than the concept of pain, for example. Often when people feel pain they exhibit characteristic pain behavior, such as wincing, screaming, gritting their teeth, etc. Sometimes people feel pain but suppress such behavior. But even then they are disposed to exhibit such behavior, at least normally. That much is not controversial; but, according to philosophical behaviorism, to experience pain is to have the associated sorts of dispositional states. According to Putnam, that thesis is false. He devises a series of thought experiments designed to demonstrate its falsity. THE CASE Imagine a community of super-spartans in which the adults can ­suppress all involuntary pain behavior.

THE CASE Most thought experiments begin directly with contemplation of a proposed scenario; but the one we consider in this chapter requires a brief prelude—and, unfortunately, the prelude involves a bit of pain. Pinch yourself, say, on the underside of your left arm. You don’t have to pinch very hard, but you should pinch forcefully enough that you CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 14 can focus on the pain you’re feeling.

By ­contrast, Stoljar (2006) takes his own slug example to undermine ­Jackson’s knowledge argument. Stoljar’s moral is that the knowledge and conceivability arguments owe their apparent force to ignorance— ignorance of physical facts that are, at least currently, unknown (see Chapter 10; for similar responses, see Nagel 1974, McGinn 1989, van Gulick 1993, Polger 2004, Churchland 1996).

{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": " Here the burden is to explain why we might naturally have the intuition in a way that is consistent with the intuitive judgment being false. Karen Neander (1991) tries to meet that burden by arguing that, even if our intuitions about real cases have some measure of reliability, the Swampman case is hypothetical and unrealistic. Neander (1996) and others, includ- ing Millikan (1996), also argue that our intuitions about Swampman might be no more trustworthy than analogous intuitions that have been proven false. For example, consider the proposition that there could be water without H2O. It is widely accepted that there is no such possibility. Water could not exist without H2O because water is H2O (Kripke 1972, Putnam 1975). There could be a substance with all the superficial features of water—something that is indistinguish- able from water if one does not examine it with a microscope, say. CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 150 But that would not be water. Similarly, Neander, Millikan, and others argue, although Swampman could exist, he would not have mental states with representational content. That is because what it is to have such states is (partly) to have states with a history of co-varying with certain environmental factors, features that his states lack. In other words, we should not expect intuition to reveal the true nature of rep- resentational content any more than intuition reveals the true nature of water. Swampman himself would probably be surprised to discover that his words don’t refer to anything. But, according to Neander, Millikan, and others, that is true nonetheless. Lastly, some argue that, on reflection, the possibility of ­Swampman existing with representational mentality is compatible with the teleo- logical theories in question.

They all think he must be joking, and they chide him for being late for work. So, who has woken up in the cobbler’s bed? Is it the prince or the cobbler? According to Locke, the answer is obvious. Though the individual has the cobbler’s body, he is clearly the same person as the prince. DISCUSSION Locke uses the prince and the cobbler case as support for what contemporary philosophers have referred to as the memory theory PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 242 of personal identity (though see Behan 1979 for an argument that the interpretation of Locke as a memory theorist is mistaken). What makes an individual at one time the same person as an individual at another time is not a soul or a body, but rather the continuity of con- sciousness that enables the individual at the later time to remember the experiences of the individual at the earlier time. Even having the same soul (without any memories accompanying it) is not enough. If we discovered that the prince somehow had the same soul as Nestor of Troy but didn’t remember anything about Nestor’s experiences or about Troy, we should not identify the prince as the same person as Nestor. Likewise, though it might not be immediately apparent to those who interact with the cobbler’s body that they are really inter- acting with the prince, when we consider the fact that the cobbler’s body now has all the memories of the prince and none of the mem- ories of the cobbler, we are not inclined to identify the individual as the same person as the cobbler. In the centuries since Locke’s time, similar hypothetical scenarios have often turned up in works of fiction and film, and our judgments about them seem generally to accord with Locke’s judgment about the prince and cobbler case.

For example, very roughly, pain is that mental state that typically: (i) is caused by damage to the body; (ii) causes wincing and saying things like “ouch”; and (iii) combines with the desire to avoid the state and the belief that aspirin will help do that to cause one to take aspirin.

DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-29 TWIN EARTH AND ARTHRITIS MAN BACKGROUND Some mental states are propositional attitudes: attitudes (such as belief or doubt) toward propositions (such as the proposition that grass is green). One can believe that grass is green, hope that grass is green, desire that grass is green, etc. The relevant propositions are sometimes described as mental contents, which in turn are often described as containing concepts or notions, such as the concept of being green. Features of one’s environment often causally influence which prop- ositions one believes, desires, etc. For example, seeing grass typically causes one to form beliefs about it. But do the contents that figure into one’s propositional attitudes depend constitutively on one’s en- vironment? That is, are features of the environment part of the nature of one’s propositional attitudes? According to internalism (also known as individualism), the answer is no.

Criticisms of this thought experiment often point to the role that memory seems to be playing in Dennett’s discussion.

But when defenders of the traditional conception of qualia suggest that qualia are meant to be directly ap- prehensible, that is meant to apply to current qualitative experience. The fact that we might incorrectly remember the precise qualitative nature of past qualitative experiences does not show that the notion of qualia is confused. A related criticism of Dennett’s discussion suggests that he has in- terpreted the notion of direct and immediate apprehensibility too strongly. As Dennett interprets it, individuals are required to be com- pletely infallible about their own qualitative experience.

I have a knife and I’m not afraid to use it.” You take yourself to be experiencing a sharp pain. As the moments go by, however, you realize that the sensation you thought was painful is really just cold. It turns out that there was no knife, but just a frozen popsicle.

The features of consciousness that distinguish you and your zom- bie twin are sometimes called “phenomenal properties” or “qualia”. Zombies lack qualia. For that reason, zombie cases are sometimes de- scribed as “absent qualia” cases (see Chapter 16). DISCUSSION Some respond to the zombie argument by rejecting physicalism and exploring non-physicalist alternatives, such as dualism (Chalmers 1996; see Chapter 4). Others respond by rejecting one or more of the zombie argument’s three main premises. Though all three premises have been challenged, most accept the third and reject either the first or the second (though for a challenge to the third, see Montero 2013, and for a reply see Alter 2023). The discussion tends to get pretty technical. But the basic ideas are fairly intuitive. To reject the first premise is to deny that a zombie world is ideally conceivable. Sometimes something seems conceivable at first, but on reflection we realize we are just confused. Recall an example from Chapter 3. In objecting to Descartes’ conceivability argument, Ar- nauld (1641) suggests that someone might be able to conceive of a right triangle that doesn’t conform to the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of its sides is slightly greater than its hypotenuse squared. But such a triangle isn’t ideally conceivable. Enough reflection would reveal that it makes no sense.

When she sees grass, cucumbers, and unripe bananas, her visual experience is not phenomenally green but rather phenomenally red. This inverted qualia case is interpersonal. There are also intrap- ersonal cases. Imagine that someone who has never been inverted becomes inverted overnight (Wittgenstein 1968, Shoemaker 1982, Block 1990). Perhaps this happens because inverting lenses were sur- reptitiously placed on his eyes while he slept. At first, he might well say things like, “To me, grass looks red and blood looks green!” But we can suppose he learns to adapt to use color words, calling grass “green” and blood “red.” Once he is fully adapted, he is functionally undetectable from people whose color vision is not inverted, except that he remembers how he experienced the world prior to his inver- sion. But that exception can be removed. We can simply suppose that he develops amnesia about that earlier period.

Some knowledge:\n Thus, unless we are prepared to admit that we might be wrong about whether we have qualitative states, we should accept that the Blockhead too has qualitative states. A third possible objection owes to the work of Hilary Putnam (1967; see also Tononi 2012). Consider a swarm of bees. Though each individual bee in the swarm might be conscious, Putnam notes that we tend not to think of the swarm as a whole as conscious. According to Putnam, we’re intuitively committed to an anti-nesting principle: No conscious being can be broken down into decomposable parts that are themselves conscious. Because this principle is violated in the Block- head case—since each mini-individual is itself conscious—the case is not really conceivable. In response, Block has suggested that the anti-nesting principle has unintuitive consequences. Suppose that sci- entists were to develop tiny chips that could serve as replacements or enhancements for neurons, and suppose that the tiny chips themselves had low levels of consciousness. If we commit to the anti-­nesting principle, then we would have to accept that a person who opts to have one of these tiny chips inserted into their brain is rendered ­unconscious as a result.

When she puts the bacon into the pan and hears the sizzle, she has a sensation of red. When she cracks an egg, she has a sensation of blue. And when she pours orange juice into a glass, she has a sensation of green. How are we to characterize these color experiences? Are they per- ceptual in nature? If so, should we say that Cyndi is seeing green or hearing green? Neither of these options seems satisfactory. On the one hand, given that colors are typically discriminated vis- ually, it may seem tempting to say that Cyndi is seeing green as she’s pouring the orange juice. But there is nothing green in her visual field. Her eyes may even be closed while she is having the relevant experience. Moreover, given that her color experience is caused by Synesthesia 219 an auditory stimulus, it may seem odd to characterize her perceptual experience as something that’s visual in nature. One way that we dis- tinguish auditory experiences from visual experiences is in terms of the kinds of inputs that generate the relevant experience. In Cyndi’s case, there is not the kind of input typical of visual experiences. In this case, the input is auditory in nature. That suggests that we should say she is hearing the color. And in fact, this is how synesthesia is often described, as in neurologist Rich- ard Cytowic’s 1998 book titled, The Man Who Tasted Shapes (see also Brang and Ramachandran 2011). But it’s not clear how we are to make sense of the claim that colors can be heard. Given the nature of colors, they are not the kinds of experiences that can be discrim- inated from one another by way of auditory perception.

{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": ") Some argue that the same is true of the zombie scenario: enough reflection would reveal that the zombie scenario is incoherent (see Chapter 32). On one version of that objection, the reason zombies seem con- ceivable is that we don’t yet know enough about what a zombie world would be like (Stoljar 2006). Such a world would be exactly like the actual world in all physical respects. But how can we claim to know what that entails? The physical sciences aren’t completed. There is much about the physical world we don’t know. Perhaps future discoveries in physics will reveal some inconsistency in the idea of a physical/functional duplicate of the actual world without Zombies 41 consciousness—discoveries that would prove that any such physi- cal/functional duplicate would have to contain consciousness. If we can’t see that inconsistency today, that might be because current physics is incomplete. In response, proponents of the zombie argu- ment argue that any future discovery in physics could only reveal information of the same kind that current physics reveals—namely, information about causal, spacetime structure. In their view, no rev- elation of that sort would undermine, or even weaken, the intuition that a zombie world is conceivable (see Chapter 4; Chalmers 2003, Alter 2023). Another physicalist response to the zombie argument is to deny its second premise: the claim that the ideal conceivability of a zombie world entails that it is metaphysically possible. Here, one might in- voke an analogy to hydrogen-free water. Many philosophers regard such a thing as metaphysically impossible, on the grounds that water is H2O. But suppose you don’t know anything about the chemical composition of water. You might nevertheless well understand the concept of water. Plausibly, many people had that concept well before the chemical composition of water was discovered. So, suppose you are in that sort of position: you know what water is in an everyday sense, but you don’t know that it’s really H2O.\nYou are an AI domain expert.

Some knowledge:\n PART IV PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION INTRODUCTION Much of philosophy of mind concerns big-picture questions—for example, questions about the nature of mind or about the nature of consciousness. But philosophers of mind also devote considerable at- tention to more specific questions concerning various mental states and mental capacities. We have already explored some questions of this more specific sort, particularly in connection with belief. In Part IV, we explore a series of specific questions that arise in connection with perception, imagination, and attention. We start with three issues that trace back to the 17th and 18th centuries. In Chapter 30, we consider a thought experiment first pro- posed by William Molyneux in a letter to John Locke. This thought experiment explores the relationship between perception in different sensory modalities—for example, between visual perception and tac- tile perception. In particular, we are asked to consider a person blind from birth whose sight is restored. While blind, the person could use their sense of touch to identify various three-dimensional objects such as cubes and spheres. Now with sight restored, would the individual be able to identify such objects purely by sight, without touching them? In Chapter 31, we consider a thought experiment owing to David Hume that explores the limits of imagination and sheds light on the de- bate about whether all of our concepts trace back to experience. Suppose that a person has seen all the shades of blue that humans can distinguish DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-34 PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 184 except one—call it blue76.

Here is some potentially-relevant context:\n Or at least the difference would not be even partly based, as it plainly is, on psychological facts about the person you observed saying “Gav- agai!” and other native speakers of the language you’re studying. Quine (1969) recognizes that such consequences of his doctrine can seem absurd, especially when one applies it to one’s own words. In response to that sort of worry, he appeals to another doctrine: the rela- tivity of meaning and reference. In physics, a particle has a position and a velocity not in any absolute sense but only relative to a coordinate system. In Quine’s view, the same is true of meaning and reference. As he puts it, “Reference is nonsense except relative to a coordinate system” (1969, p. 47), where a “coordinate system” is provided by a specific language, such as English. But does that analogy address the worry? In physics, the position and velocity of a particle consists en- tirely in its relations to a coordinate system. By contrast, there seems to be more to meaning than just the relations a term has to the language of which it is a part. Of course, which particular meaning a word has is relative to a language. For example, the word “gift” means present relative to English, but it means poison relative to German. Likewise, “rabbit” means rabbit only relative to English. But meaning itself does not seem to be language-dependent. When we ask whether there is a translation of “rabbit” into some other language, we are asking pre- cisely whether there is a term in that other language with the same (language-independent) meaning. Is rejecting behaviorism enough to undermine the case for Quine’s indeterminacy doctrine? Many philosophers who reject behaviorism accept that doctrine, or something close to it.

{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": " To support that conclusion, David Chalmers considers some ­theories of consciousness that scientists have developed. One is ­Bernard Baars’ (1988) global workspace theory of consciousness. In this theory, the cognitive system that our brains realize includes a sort of central ­processor—a global workspace that mediates commu- nication between more specialized processors. Baars uses the model to explain contrasts between conscious and unconscious cognitive functions: information in the global workspace is conscious, while other information is not. Baars’ theory is controversial. But, even if his theory is true, the hard problem isn’t solved. The hard prob- lem isn’t about explaining cognitive functions. One might suppose that all and only conscious experiences (in the relevant what-it’s- like sense) are contents of the global workspace. But the question remains: why are those contents experienced at all? Similar things can be said about other scientific theories of consciousness, such as the theory that certain 35–75 hertz neural oscillations in the cerebral cortex are the basis of consciousness (Crick and Koch 1990). Indeed, some such theories aim only to account for the neural correlates of consciousness—the neural processes that accompany all and only conscious experiences. And correlation is not explanation. (Perhaps red cars are more likely to be involved in accidents than non-red cars; that is, perhaps there is a correlation between being a red car and be- ing especially likely to get in an accident. The question remains: why is there that correlation?) The Hard Problem of Consciousness 21 The hard problem concerns scientific explanation. But it gives rise to a challenge to physicalism—the philosophical theory on which no aspect of the mind is over and above the physical. The challenge could be stated roughly as follows.

Standard methods in cognitive science can explain many features associated with consciousness. For example, consider reportability—the ability to produce verbal reports about one’s inner states. Here the feature we want to explain is a cognitive ability, or the performance of a cognitive function. That is something the standard methods of cog- nitive science are especially good at: working out the ­computational and/or neural mechanisms that underlie the performance of cognitive functions (or the exercise of an ability). Once such mechanisms have been sufficiently detailed, there is nothing left to explain. When that is the case, we could describe a feature as being functionally ­definable. And the problem of explaining functionally definable features is what Chalmers calls an “easy” problem. The same explanatory model ­applies to almost all other features associated with the term “con- sciousness”—such as being awake rather than asleep and being able to focus one’s attention on one’s holey socks. CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 20 But there is a glaring exception: experience itself—that is, the ­what-it’s-like aspect of consciousness. Here, the problem isn’t about explaining the performance of a cognitive function. It’s about why there’s any experience there all.

And why the particular sort of experience that accompanies that performance, rather than one with a distinct experiential character? There would seem to be what Joseph Levine (1983) calls an explanatory gap between the performance of functions and experience.

If so, then consciousness itself is wholly different from anything physical. To put it another way, since nothing physical can bridge the explana- tory gap, we need to appeal to something non-physical. Otherwise, the connection between consciousness and the physical world will remain forever mysterious. DISCUSSION The hard problem has long been recognized. For example, Thomas Nagel’s 1974 classic “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” begins with the following sentence: “Consciousness is what makes the mind-body problem really intractable.” And in 1866, T. H. Huxley wrote, How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of initiating nerve tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin, where Aladdin rubbed his lamp in the story. Philosophers of earlier eras doubtless understood the problem no less acutely than Chalmers, Nagel, and Huxley do. Even so, work on it has intensified considerably since the publication of Chalmers’s 1995 article, “Facing Up to the Hard Problem of Consciousness,” and his influential 1996 book, The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory. Some regard the hard problem as insoluble. For example, according to Colin McGinn (1989), although there is a naturalistic solution, we humans are “cognitively closed” to it, due to limitations in our ­concept-forming abilities. In his view, we simply cannot form con- cepts that would enable us to see why, for example, undergoing a certain type of brain process must be felt as pain, even if pain were identical to that brain process.

Perhaps instead we should deny that Cyndi’s experience is per- ceptual in nature. Perhaps we should say that she’s merely imagining green. But this too seems implausible. Typically, imagination is volun- tarily produced, but Cyndi would deny that her experience of green is something that she’s voluntarily producing. Also, we can usually tell when we’re imagining and when we’re perceiving; but it doesn’t feel to Cyndi like she’s imagining. Moreover, tests reveal that her experi- ence of the sound of pouring orange juice and the sensation of green are stably coordinated for her over a long period of time. The con- nection between the sound and the color seems to be too tight and too immediate for it to be simply an imaginative association or some other learned association of ideas. And there’s nothing special about Cyndi. Tests on other synesthetes reveal similar results. For example, consider a typical color-grapheme synesthete whom we’ll call Jade. For Jade, the number 2 appears red (see Ramachandran and Hubbard 2001). She is presented with an array of numbers printed in green ink.

A better explanation, he argues, is that, when you learn, you come to hear phonological (not semantic) features specific to that language (cf. Prinz 2006; but see Brogaard 2018).

PART V PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF Introduction This section concerns several related problems about persons that are often grouped together under the heading of the problem of personal identity. One such problem concerns the nature of persons: What makes something a person? Another such problem concerns personal identity over time: What makes person A at a given time the same person as person B at another time? Connected with these questions about the nature of persons are also questions about selfhood and the nature of the self. As we saw in the introduction to Part I, contemporary discussions of the mind–body problem in the western tradition often trace to Descartes. In contrast, contemporary discussions of the problem of personal identity in the western tradition tend to trace to a different philosopher living in the 17th century, John Locke. On Locke’s view, a person is “a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself.” This definition leads him to a view of personal identity over time that focuses on continuity of psychology, and, in particular, on continuity of memory. Locke motivates his mem- ory theory of personal identity by way of a body-swapping thought ex- periment.

He has seen nice postcards of the capital of England, and so readily and sincerely assents to the sentence “Londres est jolie.” Whatever we might think of his evidence, it seems clear that Pierre believes London is pretty. That’s just what the French sentence means: he speaks French fluently, and he assents to it. A little later in life, Pierre moves to an unattractive part of London. While there, he picks up English from those around him (rather than by transla- tion) and, naturally enough, comes to know that the English call this city “London.” Because he never leaves his bad neighborhood, Pierre comes to sincerely assent to the sentence “London is not pretty.” It seems clear that Pierre believes London is not pretty. That’s just what the sentence means: he speaks English fluently, and he assents to it. Nevertheless, and here’s the twist, Pierre never realizes the city in the postcard was the city he lives in now. He still unhesitatingly assents to the sentence “Londres est jolie.” The belief expressed by that sentence didn’t change. But now we have a puzzle. Pierre, who is perfectly ra- tional, seems to believe at one and the same time that London is pretty and that London is not pretty. Pierre seems to be in the same position as Caroline: we seem forced to describe him as having contradictory beliefs, even though he is not irrational.

Pain itself is identified with whatever state plays pain’s typical causal role.

Some knowledge:\n Whenever we use ordinary language meaningfully, there are multiple, mutually inconsistent things that our words could mean, and there is no fact of the matter about which of those things is correct. Quine uses the case we consider in this chapter to help motivate these startling results. THE CASE Imagine that you’re an explorer in an unfamiliar place. You come across a tribe of people who speak a language that is wholly un- known to you. You try to write a translation manual that translates sentences of their language into English. They say “Gavagai!” when a rabbit scurries by. What does that translate into, in English? “There goes a rabbit!”? At first, that seems reasonable. After all, that’s what you’d probably say if you retained your mastery of English but found yourself in the position of the person saying “Gavagai!” But then you realize that there are other possibilities—for exam- ple, “There goes an undetached part of a rabbit!” and “There goes a temporal stage in a rabbit’s life history!” And you remind yourself that you’re concerned with what the people of the tribe mean, not with what you yourself might have said. Still, you think, it was an actual rabbit that scurried by, not merely an undetached rabbit part or a rabbit stage. But then you remember two other things. First, the translation manual should concern “Gavagai!” as that sentence is used generally, not just on this one occasion. For that reason, you shouldn’t assume that the fact that there was actually a rabbit present plays an es- sential role in determining the sentence’s meaning. The same sentence might be prompted by, for example, seeing a cleverly disguised fake rabbit. Second, you’re concerned with meaning in an objective, scien- tific sense. You realize that, as Quine (1960, p. 31) puts it, the relevant stimulus for the utterance of “Gavagai!” is “the pattern of chromatic irradiation of the eye” that the rabbit-sighting caused in the person you are observing—a pattern that might as easily have been caused by a fake rabbit."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I've come across the word \"Gavagai!\" in a linguistics context, but I'm not sure what it means.

From a scientific perspective, the objective meaning of \"Gavagai!\" is the pattern of chromatic irradiation of the eye that triggers the utterance of the word, regardless of whether the stimulus is a real rabbit or a fake one. This meaning is based on the stimulus that causes the word to be spoken."}, {"from": "human", "value": "That's interesting.

It's not necessarily about the actual presence of a rabbit."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I see.

This ambiguity makes translation a complex task."}]}

Answering this kind of question has been singled out many philosophers as being uniquely hard, perhaps even unsolvable. Patricia Churchland disagrees. In her view, insofar as this assessment seems plausible, it’s only because we’ve been hornswoggled. To be hornswoggled is to be deceived or cheated—as Churchland puts it, it’s “to be fooled by something because you’ve been insuffi- ciently sceptical.

Planets orbiting the sun do so in an elliptical fashion. But these orbits are not perfectly elliptical in nature. The point of the orbit where a planet is closest to the sun— called the perihelion—does not always occur at exactly the same place. This rotational change in the orbit is called a precession. The orbital precessions of the planets could be predicted and explained within the context of Newtonian theories, with one exception: Mercury. Though Newton’s theories predict that Mercury’s orbit will have a precession of 5557 seconds of arc per century, in fact the precession of Mercury’s orbit is 5600 seconds of arc per century.

The Coffee Tasters 53 Reflection on cases like Chase and Sanborn help bring attention to the nature of this illusion. Though illusionism has some persistent supporters, it remains a minority view; and most philosophers remain unpersuaded that the Chase and Sanborn case presents a deep puzzle. Criticisms of this thought experiment often point to the role that memory seems to be playing in Dennett’s discussion. For example, Ned Block (1995) sug- gests that Chase and Sanborn’s mistakes are all traceable to problems with their memories of qualia. But when defenders of the traditional conception of qualia suggest that qualia are meant to be directly ap- prehensible, that is meant to apply to current qualitative experience. The fact that we might incorrectly remember the precise qualitative nature of past qualitative experiences does not show that the notion of qualia is confused. A related criticism of Dennett’s discussion suggests that he has in- terpreted the notion of direct and immediate apprehensibility too strongly. As Dennett interprets it, individuals are required to be com- pletely infallible about their own qualitative experience. But we might accept that people can make various mistakes about their qualitative experiences while still holding onto the traditional conception of qualia. For example, suppose you are walking alone late at night and someone comes up behind you, presses something into your back, and says, “Don’t move. I have a knife and I’m not afraid to use it.” You take yourself to be experiencing a sharp pain. As the moments go by, however, you realize that the sensation you thought was painful is really just cold. It turns out that there was no knife, but just a frozen popsicle.

So, although Tye believes that “our visual fields do not have gaps in them” (because we unconsciously perceive things we don’t notice), he maintains that conscious perception is sparse.

When you first see drawing A, you do see the glasses, and Sarah does see Sam—consciously, in both cases. You just don’t notice that you do. On this view, consciousness requires neither attention nor access (at least not in the ways Tye and others think). One proponent of that alternative view is Fred Dretske (2007). Ac- cording to Dretske, Sarah sees Sam because she can know things about him by the way he looks. For example, she knows that no one gath- ered around the table was wearing a clown suit. If Sam had not been dressed normally (say, normally for a dinner party rather than a circus), then Sarah might not have been able to know that. Sarah saw Sam. She just didn’t notice that she did.

According to Siegel, the answer is provided by the Rich Content View. Before you learned how to recognize pine trees by sight, the property of being a pine tree was not part of the representational content of your visual experience of seeing a pine tree. But that property is part of that content now that you’re an expert pine-tree spotter. That, Siegel argues, is what explains the perceptual change. Likewise, the change in how Cyrillic looks to you now, as compared to when you couldn’t read it, is explained by which properties your visual experiences represent. After, but not be- fore, you learned how to read Russian, your experiences represented semantic properties of the Cyrillic symbols (semantic properties are properties concerning meaning). In both cases, there is a striking ex- periential shift, which Siegel calls a phenomenal contrast. That, in brief, is Siegel’s argument for the Rich Content View: we should believe it because it explains the phenomenal contrasts.

Munton (2021) argues that this only seems strange because we are implicitly accepting a pictorial model of perception, according to which our representation of a scene is like a photograph of it. On this model, it makes sense to represent redness only by, say, representing a particular instance of red in all its determinacy. But, Munton insists, representation is not always like that. We can hope that our team wins without hoping for a particular score. I can remember that I caught a fish on my seventh birthday without remembering the particular kind or size of fish. Perceiving the speckled hen—or really anything complex—is more like this than it is of possessing a mental picture of the hen. If this is plausible, it provides an elegant resolution of the puzzle. Some philosophers prefer to retain the metaphysical portion of the theory of seemings—perhaps along with the implicit pictorialism—but PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 204 reject its strong epistemological claim (Fantl and Howell 2003). There are determinate mental images on this view, but we can be wrong about their properties. In the case of the hen, we represent it as hav- ing a determinate number of speckles, but we’re fallible about certain features of our representations. This fallibilist position offers a solution to the swatches puzzle as well. S*1 and S*2 are in fact qualitatively distinguishable, but we are fallible about slight qualitative differences in our sensory representations. It might seem, though, that this solution flies in the face of the in- tuitions that made us posit “seemings” in the first place. How can we be wrong about how our seemings seem?

DISCUSSION The example of Eloise comes from Gilbert Harman (1990), but other representationalists use similar examples to make the same point (see, e.g., Tye 1995, p. 30). This point about attention seems to have been first noticed by G. E. Moore, who claimed that, when we’re having a blue experience and we “try to introspect the sensation of blue, all we can see is the blue: the other element is as if it were diaphanous” (1903, p. 25). In line with this notion of diaphanousness, contempo- rary philosophers talk of the transparency of experience, and they tend to take examples like Eloise to establish what’s often referred to as the transparency thesis. According to this thesis, experience is transparent in the way that a pane of glass is transparent. Just as we see right through a pane of glass to whatever is on the other side of it, we “see” right through our experience to whatever it is representing. PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 112 Though transparency has been most commonly discussed with respect to visual experience, many philosophers take it to be true for perceptual experiences generally (Tye 1995). For example, Clare Batty (2010) has argued that olfactory experience is transparent. On her view, when we’re having an olfactory experience, the properties we’re smelling are presented to us as out in the world or as around us. Granted, we might not always know what object in particular has produced the relevant odor. But, she argues, when we try to attend to an olfactory experience, we “smell” through that experience directly to the world, even if not to particular external objects in the world."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I've been exploring this idea of transparency in experience, and I have a question.

Some knowledge:\n DISCUSSION Balog’s argument could be seen as an instance of the phenomenal concept strategy for rejecting the zombie argument (and related ­arguments, such as the knowledge argument). This strategy accepts the conceivability of zombies, but explains it in terms of special ­features of phenomenal concepts rather than special features of the ­phenomenal properties those concepts pick out (Stoljar 2005). Balog’s argument also has much in common with a related strategy, on which ­phenomenal concepts are construed as conditional concepts: they refer to physical states if the world is entirely physical, and to non-physical states if the world is not entirely physical (Hawthorne 2002, Stalnaker 2002, Braddon-Mitchell 2003; but see Alter 2007.). Like the phenomenal concept strategy, the conditional analysis strategy defends physical- ism by appealing to claims about phenomenal concepts. But, unlike the phenomenal concept strategy, the conditional analysis is used to challenge the premise that zombies are conceivable rather than the premise that zombies are possible if conceivable. Zombie-argument proponents, such as David J. Chalmers (2007, 2010), respond to Balog’s argument by rejecting her analogy between zombies and yogis. Chalmers suggests that the yogis’ flurg concept differs significantly from phenomenal concepts (or at least from the sorts of phenomenal concepts that are most relevant to the zombie ar- gument). The yogis’ flurg concept is a kind of demonstrative concept: its content could be roughly expressed as “this inner state, whatever that turns out to be.” By contrast, phenomenal concepts do not seem to be demonstrative concepts.

So much so that, though there remains much to learn, it might seem all but inevitable that a scientific explanation of consciousness is forthcoming. Former mysteries, including some about life itself, are mysteries no longer. Why should consciousness be any different? In fact, there may be a reason. Some argue that consciousness presents an especially perplexing difficulty, which David J. Chalmers (1995) calls the hard problem of consciousness. We use terms like “conscious” and “consciousness” in different ways. For example, sometimes we want to mark the distinction between being awake and being asleep, as in 4 The Hard Problem of Consciousness 19 “I lost consciousness the minute my head hit the pillow.” Sometimes we want to indicate awareness, as in: “Yes, I am fully conscious that my socks have holes in them.” And sometimes we mean subjective experience, such as the pain of arthritis, the visual experience of see- ing a red rose, or the existential angst one might feel while contem- plating Sartre’s reflections on death. What unites such diverse states is that there is something it’s like to have them (Nagel 1974; see Chapter 5). It is this last sort of consciousness—the “what-it’s-like” sort, also known as phenomenal consciousness—that the hard problem concerns. In this chapter, we’ll refer to that aspect of consciousness simply as “experience.” THE CASE At the moment, my elbow hurts.

In “Quining Qualia,” Dennett offers a number of thought experiments—or what he refers to as “intuition pumps”—with the aim of casting similar doubt on the usefulness of the notion of qualia. Especially central to his case is the example of the coffee tasters, which we will focus on here. 9 CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 50 Qualia (also known as phenomenal properties) are properties of experiences (see Chapters 4 and 5). For example, these are the prop- erties in virtue of which there is something it is like to feel a sharp stitch of pain in your side or to smell the sweet and fragrant scent of a blooming lily. Dennett works with a notion of qualia that he takes to be firmly embedded in philosophical treatments of the mind: (1) qualia are ineffable, i.e., they cannot be fully or adequately described; (2) qualia are intrinsic properties, i.e., they cannot be analyzed merely in terms of their relations to other things; (3) qualia are directly or immediately apprehensible in consciousness, i.e., one can introspect them; and (4) qualia are private, i.e., no one other than the individual who is having them can directly or immediately apprehend them. THE CASE Imagine two individuals we’ll call “Mr. Chase” and “Ms. Sanborn” who have worked for the last decade as coffee tasters in the quality control division of a coffee company. When Chase and Sanborn first started at the company, it seemed like a dream job. What could be ­better than spending a lot of time tasting the coffee that they both love? Recently, however, they are no longer quite as fond of their jobs, as each finds that they no longer like the taste of the company’s dis- tinctive coffee blend.\nYou are an AI domain expert.

Those philosophers usually believe that a complete physics would be a fully general science, leaving nothing out. Nevertheless, many also believe that sciences with more limited domains—the so called “special sciences” like psychology and biology—are essential to getting a full picture of the world. The special sciences discover things physics does not. And they help us see nature’s joints, so to speak, even if those joints aren’t the fundamental ones. This view about the relationship between the sciences is often reflected in beliefs about the nature of the mind. THE CASE Two popular beliefs seem to be in tension: (1) physics is complete in the sense that everything that happens is covered by physical law, and if you fix everything described by physics, you fix the nature of the world as a whole; and (2) sciences such as psychology and biology dis- cover important truths about the world that physics does not capture. Can these views be reconciled? 13 PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 78 One reaction is concessive: the “special sciences” are just different ways of talking about the same events, perhaps at different levels of descriptions—zoomed out or zoomed in—or restricted to different contexts; but physics ultimately doesn’t leave anything out."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I've been reading some philosophy lately and I'm trying to understand the relationship between the physical sciences and the special sciences.

What matters is whether they have a unified enough nature to enter into laws. Now, though, there seems to be a dilemma. Either the special science kinds such as “money” or “belief” are unified enough to be in laws or not. If they are, then there is no problem with there being a kind including them. But Fodor’s own argument insists that they aren’t unified enough to be a kind. The various physical instances of currency are too motley, too disparate to have much in common at all. If that’s the case, though, they seem more like jade—they have too little in common to support lawful generalizations or to support scientific inferences. If this is true, we shouldn’t count these disjunctive kinds as scientific kinds at all, whether in special sciences or physical sciences. In essence, Kim’s point can be put as follows: if special science kinds are too causally heterogeneous to support scientific generalizations, then they cannot support special-science generalizations. Since the motley causal nature of the special science kinds are an essential part of the argument for the autonomy of the special sciences, the autonomy of those sciences comes at the cost of their not being scientific after all. How does this bear on psychology and mental kinds? One way to think of it is to ask whether beliefs are like jade. The argument was supposed to be that beliefs are independent (non-physical) kinds ­because there can be, for example, human beliefs and robot beliefs The Puzzle of the Special Sciences 81 with very little in common physically.

THE CASES First example: you’ve been hired to cut down all the pine trees in a grove that contains many different sorts of trees. You don’t know what pine trees look like. Fortunately for you (though not for the pines), someone points out which trees are pines, and your ability to recog- nize pine trees improves over the following weeks.

To you, what’s on the page are just meaningless squiggles and squoggles. Then you go about learning to read Russian, and eventually you succeed. The same page, with the Cyrillic text unaltered, looks notably different to you than it used to. When you started to learn, you had to attend to each letter separately, but now it actually takes effort to do that. You perceive the symbols as meaningful words and sentences.

One is a simple fact about translation: “London is pretty” is a translation of “Londres est jolie,” and so those sentences express the same propo- sition. The other is an unobjectionable view about belief ascription: when a subject assents to a sentence “S” and understands what “S” Puzzling Pierre 175 means—namely S—then the subject believes S. It seems we often use these principles implicitly. Suppose John, an English-speaker, sincerely assents to the sentence “London is pretty.” It looks like we should say John believes London is pretty. Suppose Jacques, a French-speaker, sincerely asserts to the sentence “Londres est jolie.” It seems we should say Jacques also believes London is pretty. Following the same sorts of principles in the Pierre case leads to the puzzling fact that Pierre be- lieves both that London is pretty and that London is not pretty. There are at least two lessons we can take from Kripke’s example. First, it’s a puzzle: what exactly does Pierre believe? Something seems to have gone wrong here; but what? Second, since it seems puzzles of this sort can be generated without the Millian principle; we might think again about our inclination to reject that principle because of Hespe- rus/Phosphorus cases: they appear to be very similar to the Londres/ London cases, after all, which don’t depend on the Millian principle. If the puzzle raises a general problem for belief ascription, it’s not clear the Millian principle is to blame in Hesperus/Phosphorus cases after all.

She builds her case by developing a thought experiment involving creatures she calls “yogis.” THE CASE The zombie argument against physicalism is based on a thought ex- periment. We are asked to conceive of a world that is physically and functionally the same as the actual world, except no one is conscious. In a zombie world, there is a molecule-for-molecule duplicate of you who is “seeing” worlds indistinguishable from the worlds you’re pres- ently seeing—except they have no inner, subjective life at all. If such a world is conceivable, that is partly because we can refer to our ex- periences directly, rather than via physical or functional descriptions. 8 Yogis 45 For example, we can refer to pain not just as a state that has certain physical causes and physical effects—events that have zombie coun- terparts. We can refer to pain more directly, as a state that feels a certain way—that is, a state with a certain distinctive phenomenal quality. Phenomenal qualities are what the zombie world is supposed to lack. Katalin Balog rejects the zombie argument. To show why we should too, she asks us to imagine a world with people that are much like us, except that some of them are yogis. Just as philosophical zombies are different from the zombies of horror films, philosophical yogis are dif- ferent from the yogis who practice certain forms of eastern religions. Balog’s yogis have a special concept-forming ability. They can detect some of their own brain states in a direct way, without the mediation of any physical or functional description.

For example, the concept of belief is characterized in terms of the typical causal role belief plays; and belief itself is identified with whatever state typically plays that role. On analytic functionalism, the explanation of how Martian pain is possible is straightforward. What it means to feel pain, on this view, is to have a state (any state) that plays pain’s characteristic causal role. That causal role is explained in a way that makes no essential refer- ence to human (or non-human) physiology. Marty’s pain is possible because he has states that play that role. Analytic functionalism also delivers an explanation of the possibility of mad pain. The theory identifies pain itself with the state that typically plays pain’s character- istic causal role, relative to some population. Maddy is human, and in humans c-fiber stimulation typically plays that role. Maddy feels pain because she has that neural state, even though in her that neural state does not play its typical causal role. Further, as Lewis explains, analytic functionalism can explain not only mad pain and Martian pain but also mad Martian pain. Mad Martian pain is the Martian version of mad pain, and can be explained in the same way. The mad Martian is a member of the Martian species despite their madness. They feel pain because they have the state that typically plays the relevant causal role in Martians, even though in them that state does not play that role. Key to Lewis’s solution is species (or population) relativity. The states that play the relevant causal role can differ from one species (or population) to the next, as the cases of human pain and Martian pain illustrate.

There is, however, another layer of content that captures the significance of the belief for Pierre, just as it was suggested above. This is ultimately a version of the Fregean strategy in that it provides a level of content that includes something like a term’s sense and another that includes its referent. Which of the two dimensions of content we employ when we ascribe beliefs—that is, when we say such things as “Pierre believes London is pretty,” or “Pierre believes London is not pretty,” or “Pierre believes London is pretty and he believes that it’s not pretty”—will depend in part on context.

If this is possible, then the particular pain under consideration cannot itself be a physical state. Contrary to what the physicalist claims, the pain is an irreducibly mental state. In saying that it is irreducible, Gertler means that it does not reduce to physical states. For comparison, consider a glass of water. Arguably, the water in that glass is nothing more than a collection of H2O molecules. In other words, the water reduces to H2O, and H2O itself reduces to bonded hydrogen and oxygen atoms. By contrast, ac- cording to Gertler, pain does not reduce to any physical state. DISCUSSION A related scenario has also been posed by W. D. Hart (1988); though, un- like Gertler, he does not focus on pain. Rather, he focuses on visualizing The Disembodied Pain 15 oneself disembodied (see also Chapter 1). Hart moves us slowly in im- agination from embodiment to disembodiment. You’re asked to im- agine waking up in your usual embodied state. Before you open your eyes, you carefully walk over to the mirror. In front of the mirror, when you raise your eyelids, you see empty eye sockets. You then peel back the top of your skull, and you can see that your entire skull is empty. There is no brain inside. As you stare into the mirror, the rest of your body slowly seems to melt away. By visualizing what you would see in the mirror once the entirety of your body has ­disappeared, you are able to conceive of yourself in a completely disembodied state. Again, on the assumption that whatever is conceivable is possible, we get to the conclusion that physicalism must be false and that dualism must be true. Arguments that rely on this assumption—that whatever is ­conceivable is possible—are often referred to as conceivability ­arguments. Many arguments concerning the mind–body problem and the ­nature of consciousness take this basic form: that is, they begin with a claim about what is conceivable and move to a claim about what is ­possible.\nYou are an AI domain expert.

The concept of a glass of water being reduced to H2O molecules is indeed a physical reduction. However, Gertler's view is that pain cannot be reduced to any physical state in the same way.

Gertler's position is that pain is an irreducibly mental state, and that it cannot be reduced to purely physical explanations.

For example, imagine a scenario where you're dreaming or imagining a painful experience, but there is no actual physical pain occurring.

If we find it conceivable to imagine such a scenario, we might infer that it's actually possible, which would challenge physicalism. Does that make sense?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I see. One of the thought experiments that's often used to challenge physicalism is the idea of waking up with empty eye sockets and a melting body. What role does imagination play in conceiving of such a disembodied state?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Imagination plays a key role in conceiving of a disembodied state, as it allows us to visualize what we would see if our body were to disappear. In this thought experiment, our imagination enables us to imagine what it would be like to experience the world without a physical body. This exercise in imagination can help us appreciate the complexity and richness of conscious experience, and challenge our intuitive understanding of the relationship between the mind and the body."}]}

Contemporary philosophers often character- ize the physical by deferring to physics: physical phenomena are the entities described by fundamental physics, or those plus entities that are constructed from them (Loewer 2001; see Chapter 21). In other words, to be physical is to be, or to be made of, entities that exist at the fundamental level of physical reality. For example, if quarks and lep- tons are posited by fundamental physics, then they and the things they compose are physical. But what if there is no fundamental level? For example, what if quarks and leptons are composed of more basic enti- ties? And what if those more basic entities are composed of still more basic entities, and so on forever (ad infinitum)? Physicalism shouldn’t rule that possibility out. But how can that be avoided?

Her belief is about grass and about being green. It also represents a proposition: the prop- osition that grass is green. That proposition is the representational content of her belief, in that her belief is true if and only if grass is, in fact, green. Why do mental states have the representational content they have? Why do they have representational content at all? This can seem mysterious, especially from a naturalistic perspective on which mental states are parts of the natural, physical world. For example, considered as a physical object, a photograph is nothing more than an arrangement of molecules, and molecules do not appear to be about anything. And, from a naturalistic perspective, the same would seem to be true of mental states. Teleological theories of content aim to ­dispel that mystery by showing how mental content derives from non-­ mental aspects of nature. According to such theories, mental content depends at least partly on functions of the things (or systems) that use or produce those contents.

The identity theory easily accounts for the possibility of mad pain. Maddy feels pain when her c-fibers are stimulated, just like the rest of us—even though her c-fiber stimu- lation is causally connected to other parts of her neural system in atypical ways. But the identity theory seems to exclude the possibility of Martian pain. Marty feels pain but lacks c-fibers. On the identity theory, he can no more experience pain than lightning can occur without electricity or water can exist without hydrogen. Functionalism has the reverse problem. Marty experiences pain be- cause he has states that play that role. That those role-playing states are hydraulic rather than neural is irrelevant. But now the possibility of mad pain would seem to be excluded: none of Maddy’s states play pain’s characteristic causal role. So, how can a physicalist theory account for both the possibility of mad pain (such as Maddy’s pain) and the possibility of Martian pain (such as Marty’s pain)? DISCUSSION Lewis (1966) proposes a solution cast in terms of a physicalist theory known as analytic functionalism (see also Armstrong 1968). This theory Mad Pain and Martian Pain 89 has two main components. One concerns the concept of pain. That concept is characterized in terms of pain’s typical causal role. (That is why the theory is called analytic functionalism: it is partly based on an analysis of mental concepts, such as the concept of pain—or, as it is sometimes put, an analysis of the meaning of mental terms, such as “pain.”) The other main component concerns pain itself. Pain itself is identified with whatever state plays pain’s typical causal role. For example, if in typical humans c-fiber stimulation plays the pain role, then human pain is identical to c-fiber stimulation.

One important discussion takes place in The Questions of King Milinda (The Milinda Pañha), a Buddhist text that is thought to have been written between 100 bce and 200 ce. In a conversation between King Milinda and a monk named Nagasena, this text presents an argu- ment that there is really no such thing as the self. In connection with this no-self view, however, the text also explores questions relating to a person’s endurance through time. This exploration, centered on thought experiments involving chariots and candles, is discussed in Chapter 40. The remaining chapters in Part V take up related themes. The thought experiments discussed in Chapters 41–43 raise various chal- lenges to Locke’s memory theory. Some of these challenges might be met by broadening from a theory about continuity of memory to a theory about continuity of psychology. But other challenges run deeper, and many philosophers have suggested that we would do bet- ter to abandon psychologically based theories of personal identity and instead adopt physical theories. We explore some of the considerations in favor of a physical theory in Chapter 41 by returning to a pair of thought experiments involving body-swaps. In Chapter 42, we ex- plore related issues by considering a thought experiment in which a person’s mind is uploaded to a computer. In Chapter 43, we consider a thought experiment about a statue and the clay out of which it is made in an effort to better understand the relationship between per- sons and bodies.

{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": " To understand how such a challenge arises, it will be useful to consider how philosophers differentiate mental states and attitudes from one another. Take a claim like “There are some brownies in the kitchen.” It’s possible for us to take many different mental at- titudes towards that same content. We might believe that there are 34 The Skywalk 207 some brownies in the kitchen, hope that there are some brownies in the kitchen, fear that there are some brownies in the kitchen, and so on. When trying to explain the difference between these various attitudes, philosophers of mind tend to rely heavily on their different functional profiles. Believing that there are brownies in the kitchen will bring about different behavior from that brought about by fear- ing that there are brownies in the kitchen; and it also has different connections to other mental states. Occasionally, cases arise in which we see a person behaving in ways that don’t match the expected func- tional profile of the mental states that we would typically see them as having. How should such cases be accounted for? Though sometimes we might be able to account for the behavior by reassessing which beliefs and desires (and other traditionally recognized mental states) the person has, sometimes this does not seem adequate. Faced with that inadequacy, another option would be to explore the addition of a new mental state category to our traditional taxonomy.

This bridge, the Grand Canyon Skywalk, consists of more than 1 million pounds of steel and 83,000 points of glass, and in total it weighs 1.2 million pounds. Its foundation is strong enough to support approximately 71 million pounds.

Let’s flesh out the details of the last example. Study participants saw an experimenter open a commercially labe- led box of sugar and pour some of it into two clean, empty bottles. They were then given two labels—one that said “sucrose” and one that said “sodium cyanide, poison”—and instructed to stick one to each bottle. The participants watched while water from the same source was poured into two glasses, and they also saw some powder from the bottle marked “poison” mixed into one glass and some powder from the bottle marked “sucrose” mixed into the other glass. Following all of this, participants were asked to rate how willing they were to take a sip from each glass, and the results showed a significant preference for the bottle that was labeled “sucrose”—even though participants acknowledged that they knew there was no poison in either glass, and that both glasses contained the same sugar water (Rozin et al. 1986). How do we account for these cases? It doesn’t look like an instance of contradictory beliefs. People at Skywalk don’t seem to have the The Skywalk 209 belief “It’s not safe” alongside their belief “It’s safe.” And it’s hard to see how people in the sugar water experiment would believe “There’s poison in this glass.” Do they merely imagine that Skywalk is unsafe or that there’s poison in the glass? The problem with this suggestion is that imaginings tend to be quarantined off from real-life belief and ac- tion. As Gendler puts it, imagination is like Las Vegas—what happens in imagination stays in imagination (2008b, p. 568).

Can anything general be said about the difference, beyond simply repeat- ing that one is a belief and the other is a desire?

THE CASE Imagine a man walking through a grocery store with a shopping list. The list says: cheese, bread, chocolate, grapes …. Following him is a detective who writes her own list, based on what the man bought. Her list says: cheese, bread, chocolate, grapes …. These lists are in some sense exactly the same—they name the same items. But they also 29 The Shopping List 179 differ. The shopper’s list guides the shopper’s actions—to make the list accurate, he must fill his cart with the listed items. The items should match the list. The detective’s list, on the other hand, is meant to re- flect what the shopper bought. The list should match the items. So, suppose that the man gets home and finds that instead of grapes he bought grappa. The shopper can’t fix his mistake by crossing “grapes” off the list and replacing it with “grappa.” This would miss the point of the list—to fix the mistake he needs to go back and trade the grappa for the grapes. If the detective, on the other hand, has “grapes” on her list when the man bought grappa, she can fix the mistake by correcting her list. The point can be glossed by the idea that the lists have different directions of fit. The detective’s list has to fit the way the world turns out to be. The shopper has to make the world fit the list. ­Anscombe’s suggestion, then, is that mental states differ in the same way as the lists.

Likewise, when you’re scared of a giant rattlesnake coiled on the trail ahead of you, if you try to attend to your fear your attention slips right through to what you’re scared of; in this case, that’s the rattlesnake itself. How does the transparency thesis support representationalism? We might best see the representationalist as offering an argument that takes the form of an inference to the best explanation. Qualia are meant to be intrinsic features of experience. But if there really were such intrinsic features, features that were over and above functional and representational properties, then we should be able to attend to them. According to the representationalists, the fact that we can’t at- tend to any intrinsic properties of experience is best explained by the hypothesis that there are no intrinsic properties of experience. The phenomenal properties of an experience that have been presumed to be intrinsic properties are really just representational properties. In responding to this thought experiment, some philosophers deny that representationalists have described the Eloise case properly. In their view, we can introspectively attend to more than the representationalists think we can (e.g., Block 1996, Robinson 1998). To help defend this claim, they often point to kinds of experiences where there doesn’t really seem to be anything represented by the experience. For example, consider phosphene experiences—the kind of visual experience you have when you push (lightly!) on your eyeball. When you’re having a phosphene experience of a moving, colored expanse, the sensation doesn’t really seem to be suggesting that there are actually moving, Eloise and the Tree 113 colored expanses out there in the world somewhere; and so it seems implausible to say that, in attending to our phosphene experiences, our attention to slips through to the world.\nYou are an AI domain expert.

Representationalists answer this question in the affirmative, and they typically attempt to explain phenomenal consciousness in terms of intentionality. In an attempt to support their view, they often argue that when we attempt to attend to the phenomenal character of a given phenomenally conscious mental state, we have nothing to attend to except what the mental state represents. In this chapter we’ll consider a thought experiment put forth in an effort to support this claim about attention and its relationship to representationalism. 19 Eloise and the Tree 111 THE CASE Consider Eloise, who is in her front yard looking at an oak tree. As she looks at the canopy of leaves overhead, she is having a visual ex- perience with a greenish character; and, as she touches the bark, she is having a tactile experience with a rough, bumpy character. But now suppose that she tries to attend to her experience, its greenishness say. What happens? Though she is aiming to focus her attention inward, she can’t find any intrinsic features there on which to focus, and her attention slips through to the greenishness of the tree.

There are other researchers, however, who aim to develop systems that not only simulate intelligence but also exhibit actual intelligence.

Soon someone outside the room slips a piece of paper in via a slot in the door. The paper is inscribed with some of these same characters. Consulting the rulebook, you find that the rule numbered 572 has the relevant characters in the first blank.

The remaining chapters in Part IV take up more contemporary issues. In Chapter 34 we consider a thought experiment that puts pressure on our standard taxonomy of mental states. This thought ex- periment seems to suggest that we need to accept a new category of mental states, called aliefs, that have a different kind of content from both beliefs and imaginings. In Chapter 35, we consider several thought experiments that have been put forth to suggest that percep- tion represents not just low-level features such as shape and color but also higher-level features such as being a particular kind of tree. The other chapters in Part IV don’t concern thought experiments, but rather puzzle cases drawn from real life. In Chapters 36–38, we consider three puzzling phenomena relating to perception: synesthesia, change blindness, and blindsight. For people who are synesthetes, a sensory stimulation typically associated with one perceptual modality will automatically prompt or trigger an experience in another percep- tual modality. So, for example, a synesthete might experience differ- ent shapes as having distinctive tastes or experience different sounds as having distinctive colors. Blindsight is a phenomenon that occurs in some cases when an individual’s visual cortex has been damaged.

According to exter- nalism, which mental contents we have depends constitutively on what physical and social environment we are in—for example, whether the stuff that makes up our lakes and oceans is composed chemi- cally of H2O or some other chemical substance, such as XYZ.

{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": " Fodor’s answer is that there cannot be disjunctive kinds. But why not? Kim offers an example to help us see what might be problem- atic about disjunctive kinds. Jade, it turns out, is not a single mineral. Instances of jade are either instances of the mineral nephrite or the mineral jadeite. It is, in fact, a disjunctive kind. Can we treat that as just a kind like any other? The problem is that there is no guarantee of any causal similarity between jadeite and nephrite. They could be—and in fact are—very different physically. This means that, as a kind, jade cannot be used to confirm interesting generalizations. Suppose one found 1000 pieces of jade and discovered they were all green. Suppose further that all the pieces of jade one found were jadeite. Kim claims this would not support the generalization that all jade was green. You PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 80 would have found some confirmation that all jadeite is green; but, because of the disunified nature of jade as a kind, you can’t conclude anything about other instances of jade from your evidence—they might be nephrite and you don’t know anything about nephrite! In particular, you don’t know that all—or indeed any—nephrite is green. What makes something apt for inclusion in scientific laws—i.e., what makes it a natural kind—is that it has enough unity as a kind for ob- servations about one instance to bear on observations on all instances of the kind. So, the reason we should reject disjunctive kinds like jade is that they lack such unity. At this point, Kim seems only to have given Fodor a premise for his own argument—since disjunctions can’t be kinds and can’t enter into laws, there can be no disjunctive physical law corresponding to the special science laws. But, says Kim, there is a problem.

Here is some potentially-relevant context:\n If the thought experiment is coherent, and it seems to be, it does suggest that self-awareness does not depend on a sensory awareness of the body. Some interpreters see the floating man argument as being more concerned with other special features of self-awareness (Alwishah 2013). It might be concluded, for example, that every case of aware- ness is a case of self-awareness. Though the floating man doesn’t per- ceive himself in any obvious way—by vision, taste, smell, etc.—he is still aware that he exists. This self-awareness is immediate, in the sense that it requires no intermediary awareness—no awareness of some- thing else by which one becomes aware of the self, in the way that I become aware of the dog in the yard by hearing its bark. One can be aware of the self without being aware of anything else. Avicenna argu- ably goes further, claiming that self-awareness doesn’t even require the activity of thought—self and self-awareness are in some sense identical (Alwishah 2013, pp. 62–3). However, it is difficult to see how either of these claims of immediacy follows from the floating man thought experiment, at least directly. After all, the floating man is presumably engaging in conscious thought and is aware of those thoughts. If the floating man is no longer engaging in any intellectual activity at all, it is no longer obvious that he is self-aware. Though the debate about the possibility of disembodied ­existence has medieval origins, the discussion remains alive and well today, as evidenced by the “disembodied pain” thought experiment to be ­discussed in Chapter 3. Not only is there active debate about the soundness of floating man-type arguments—which is echoed in ­discussions of zombies (see Chapter 7)—there is live debate of the role of bodily awareness in self-awareness, with some philosophers (such as Gertler 2011, esp.

The Chinese Room example also seems to pose a problem to ­functionalism—a theory of mind that treats mental states as functional states. While we have already seen other problems for functionalism that arise from its inability to handle the phenomenal character of our mental states (see Chapters 15 and 16), this example suggests that functionalism cannot adequately handle the intentional content of our mental states—that is, the aspect of our mental states in virtue of which they are about or directed at objects or states of affairs. One slogan commonly associated with functionalism is that the mind is to the brain as a computer software is to its hardware. In the Chinese Room, however, you are running the right software for understanding Mandarin, but yet you are not in the state of understanding Mandarin. Though Mandarin speakers use these characters to refer to objects or states of affair, to you they are every bit as meaningless after you’ve mastered the rulebook as when you first entered the room. Thus, if this example succeeds, it seems that functionalism must be false. DISCUSSION One common response to the Chinese Room is to argue that Searle was looking for understanding in the wrong place. When strong AI claims that computers can achieve understanding, they attribute the understanding to the entire computing system.

To try to rebut this objection, which The Chinese Room 107 Searle refers to as the Systems Reply, he suggests that the individual in the room could memorize the entire rulebook."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I've come across the Chinese Room example in discussions about the mind and artificial intelligence. How does the author respond to the objection that the understanding is located in the entire system?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "The author suggests that the individual in the room could memorize the entire rulebook. This would mean that the person in the room has a complete understanding of the rulebook, but still does not understand the language. This response is an attempt to rebut the idea that the understanding is located in the entire system. It's an interesting thought experiment, isn't it? The author is trying to draw a distinction between understanding and simply following rules."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Actually, one possible response to the Chinese Room example is to argue that the understanding is not located in the person in the room, but rather in the entire system, including the rulebook. What is the main point of this response?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "The main point of this response is that the person in the room is only one part of the system, and that the understanding can be attributed to the entire system, rather than just the individual in the room. This response is an attempt to reject one of the premises of the argument, specifically the idea that understanding is located solely in the individual. It's a way of saying that the system as a whole is responsible for the understanding, not just the person in the room."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I think I've heard of this phrase before. What slogan is commonly associated with functionalism, and how does the Chinese Room example challenge this slogan?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "The slogan is \"The mind is to the brain as a computer software is to its hardware.\" The Chinese Room example challenges this slogan by showing that having the right software (rulebook) does not necessarily mean that you understand the language. The person in the room runs the correct software, but they still do not understand Mandarin. This challenges the idea that understanding is simply a matter of having the right software or programming."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I'm curious to know how the Chinese Room example relates to functionalism. Is the Chinese Room example relevant to functionalism, a theory of mind that treats mental states as functional states?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yes, the Chinese Room example poses a problem to functionalism. Even if the person in the room follows the rules and generates Chinese characters correctly, they do not truly understand the language. This implies that functionalism cannot adequately handle the intentional content of mental states, which is the aspect of mental states that makes them about or directed at objects or states of affairs. Functionalism relies on the idea that mental states can be reduced to functional properties, but the Chinese Room example shows that this is not the case."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Finally, I'd like to know if the Chinese Room example provides evidence that strong AI is false. Does the Chinese Room example provide evidence that strong AI is false?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yes, the Chinese Room example suggests that strong AI is false. The person in the room follows the rules to generate Chinese characters, but they do not understand the language. This contradicts the idea that strong AI holds, which is that a computer can understand and think like a human being. The Chinese Room example shows that even if a machine can process and generate information correctly, it may not truly understand the meaning or context of that information."}]}
