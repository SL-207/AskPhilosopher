DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-32 PUZZLING PIERRE BACKGROUND It\u2019s a curious fact that \u201cHesperus\u201d is the Greek name of the evening star and \u201cPhosphorus\u201d is the Greek name of the morning star. As a matter of fact, the heavenly body people used these names for is just one thing\u2014the planet Venus. Suppose Caroline does not know that fact. Given this, when she sincerely asserts \u201cHesperus is not Phos- phorus,\u201d what is she believing? Despite the fact that the morning star and evening star are both Venus, to many it seems incorrect to say that Caroline is believing the contradictory claims that Venus is not Venus, Hesperus is not Hesperus, or Phosphorus is not Phosphorus. Caroline is not irrational, so none of those things seems to capture what she is thinking. Gottlob Frege introduced this sort of case to reject the \u201cMillian\u201d principle\u2014named after John Stuart Mill\u2014that co-referring names can be substituted for one another in a sentence without changing the proposition expressed by the sentence. Instead, the proposition expressed by the assertion \u201cHesperus is bright\u201d is\u2014 or at least can be\u2014different from the proposition expressed by the \u00adassertion \u201cPhosphorus is bright.\u201d According to Frege (1892), although \u201cHesperus\u201d and \u201cPhosphorus\u201d have a single reference\u2014Venus\u2014they have different \u201csenses\u201d that constitute part of their meaning.",
