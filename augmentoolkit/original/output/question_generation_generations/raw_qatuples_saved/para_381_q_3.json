    "paragraph": " So, we can legitimately project green from observed cases to unobserved cases, but we can\u2019t do so with grue. Unfortunately, this response fails because we can introduce another predicate, bleen, and see that green (and blue) can likewise be defined in terms of when something is observed. Let\u2019s start with bleen. An object is bleen just in case it is examined before the year 2100 and blue or examined at 2100 or later and green. With grue and bleen in hand, we can define our more familiar \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d in ways that makes them dependent upon when something is observed. After all, an object is green just in case it is examined before the year 2100 and grue or examined at 2100 or later and bleen. Similarly, an object is blue just in case it is examined before the year 2100 and bleen or examined at 2100 or later and grue. Hence, this seemingly obvious response doesn\u2019t get off the ground. The answer to this gruesome riddle must lie elsewhere. RESPONSES All responses to this puzzle have one common feature: they all seek to find some sort of asymmetry between green and grue with the hopes that the asymmetry will explain why it is legitimate to project the former but not the latter. The earliest attempt to come up with such an asymmetry came from Nelson Goodman (the person who came up with this New Riddle of Induction) (1954). He proposed that what makes a predicate projectable comes down to our actual induc- tive practices. \u201cGreen\u201d is much more entrenched in our practices than \u201cgrue\u201d is. In other words, we have used \u201cgreen\u201d in a number of our past inductive inferences, but we haven\u2019t used \u201cgrue.\u201d So, the thought is that the difference between what is projectible and what isn\u2019t is simply a matter of what we have projected in the past when making such inferences. Puzzles and Paradoxes 210 Another sort of response involves arguing that \u201cgreen\u201d picks out a natural kind, whereas \u201cgrue\u201d doesn\u2019t (Quine 1969).",

    "question": "What is one possible reason why \"green\" is more projectable than \"grue\"?",
    "answer": "One possible reason why \"green\" is more projectable than \"grue\" is that \"green\" is more entrenched in our past inductive practices. This means that we have used \"green\" in a number of our past inductive inferences, but we haven't used \"grue\".",
