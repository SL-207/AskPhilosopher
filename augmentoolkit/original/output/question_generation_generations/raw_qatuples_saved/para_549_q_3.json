Of course, in this sort of case the absurdity lies in the fact that what is said is contradictory. There are, however, other things that seem absurd to say that aren\u2019t contradictions. In fact, these other sorts of absurd claims might in fact be true! It can be challenging to explain exactly why it is that something that is true is nonetheless absurd to say or believe. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: MOORE\u2019S PARADOX Imagine that your friend George says to you \u201cit\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Then, on another occasion he says, \u201cit\u2019s raining, but I be- lieve that it\u2019s not raining.\u201d After making sure that you heard him cor- rectly, you\u2019re apt to conclude that he is talking nonsense. And this seems to be the right conclusion. What George said seems to be ab- surd. Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t utter a contradiction. That is, he didn\u2019t say something like \u201cit\u2019s raining and it\u2019s not raining.\u201d In fact, what George said in both cases could be true. After all, it could be that it is raining and George doesn\u2019t believe that it is, and it could also be that it is raining and George believes that it\u2019s not raining. We can even assume that when George spoke to you on both of these occasions, he was PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 236 telling the truth. Nonetheless, even if what George said was true, it still seems absurd for him to say it. But, it is challenging to explain what makes this absurd since it appears to have nothing to do with whether what George said is true. This is Moore\u2019s Paradox\u2014it seems that what George says is absurd, but it\u2019s not clear why this should be so.",
