    "paragraph": " It does, they contend, nevertheless provide some small amount of confirma- tion for \u201call ravens are black\u201d. A final sort of response to the Ravens Paradox, which purports to be at least consistent with the Bayesian framework, denies the Equivalence condition. According to this way of responding, the accuracy of formal representations of hypotheses varies with contexts of inquiry (Clarke 2010). In other words, in some contexts \u201call nonblack things are non-\u00ad ravens\u201d will be an accurate way of formulating \u201call ravens are black\u201d, i.e. there are contexts where the two are equivalent. However, in other contexts, such as the context where we are looking at ravens or pieces of chalk, \u201call nonblack things are non-ravens\u201d misrepresents the hypothesis that all ravens are black. The general idea is that we are not stuck with the counterintuitive conclusion that observing a white piece of chalk confirms that all ravens are black because the Equivalence condition is false as a general principle, and it fails to hold in this particular instance.

    "answer": "The main objection is that this conclusion is counterintuitive and doesn't make sense in the context of the observation. It is argued that the accuracy of formal representations of hypotheses varies with contexts of inquiry, and in this particular instance, the equivalence condition fails to hold.",
