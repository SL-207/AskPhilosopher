    "paragraph": " Physicalism/materialism\u2003 The theory that all concrete phenom- ena, including mental phenomena, are fundamentally physical. Glossary 321 Possibility\u2003 A proposition is possible if it might be, or might have been, the case. For example, you might have not ever read a phi- losophy book; and you might one day write a philosophy book. Both propositions are possible. See also necessity. Possible world\u2003 A way the world could have been. For example, although Chen Meng won the 2021 gold medal for women\u2019s singles in table tennis, there is a possible world in which Chen Meng lost and Mima Ito won. Property dualism\u2003 The theory that mental properties and physical properties are fundamentally distinct. For example, consider the mental property of feeling pain. In humans, pain is at least caused by brain processes. According to property dualism, however, the property of feeling pain is distinct from any neural property. This view does not say that the mind\u2014the thing that has mental \u00adproperties\u2014is distinct from the brain. But it does say that mental properties\u2014features of the mind\u2014are distinct from physical (and in particular neural) properties. See also dualism, substance dualism. Proposition\u2003 Something that is either true or false, and that is \u00adexpressible by a \u201cthat\u201d-clause, such as \u201cthat snow is white.\u201d Propositional attitude\u2003 An attitude toward a proposition, such as belief, hope, or desire. For example, one can believe that snow is white, hope that snow is white, or desire that snow is white. See also proposition. Psychological theory of personal identity\u2003 The theory of \u00adpersonal identity that holds that a person\u2019s identity over time con- sists in the continuity and connectedness of various psychological states, such as memory and intention, as well as various psycholog- ical character traits. See also memory theory of personal identity. Qualia\u2003 see phenomenal property. See also phenomenal consciousness.",
