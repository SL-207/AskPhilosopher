    "paragraph": "\u201d In the empirical literature, phenomena such as these are often treated as cases of \u201csympathetic magic\u201d (Rozin et al. 1986). Let\u2019s flesh out the details of the last example. Study participants saw an experimenter open a commercially labe- led box of sugar and pour some of it into two clean, empty bottles. They were then given two labels\u2014one that said \u201csucrose\u201d and one that said \u201csodium cyanide, poison\u201d\u2014and instructed to stick one to each bottle. The participants watched while water from the same source was poured into two glasses, and they also saw some powder from the bottle marked \u201cpoison\u201d mixed into one glass and some powder from the bottle marked \u201csucrose\u201d mixed into the other glass. Following all of this, participants were asked to rate how willing they were to take a sip from each glass, and the results showed a significant preference for the bottle that was labeled \u201csucrose\u201d\u2014even though participants acknowledged that they knew there was no poison in either glass, and that both glasses contained the same sugar water (Rozin et al. 1986). How do we account for these cases? It doesn\u2019t look like an instance of contradictory beliefs. People at Skywalk don\u2019t seem to have the The Skywalk 209 belief \u201cIt\u2019s not safe\u201d alongside their belief \u201cIt\u2019s safe.\u201d And it\u2019s hard to see how people in the sugar water experiment would believe \u201cThere\u2019s poison in this glass.\u201d Do they merely imagine that Skywalk is unsafe or that there\u2019s poison in the glass? The problem with this suggestion is that imaginings tend to be quarantined off from real-life belief and ac- tion. As Gendler puts it, imagination is like Las Vegas\u2014what happens in imagination stays in imagination (2008b, p. 568). DISCUSSION In Gendler\u2019s view, the best way to resolve the puzzle is to postulate the existence of a novel mental state\u2014what she calls alief. Alief is a state that is associative, automatic, and arational. It is not reducible to belief or other mental states/attitudes.",
