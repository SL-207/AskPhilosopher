    "paragraph": " If it is on her iPhone and plays the appropriate role in her cognitive system, it counts as her belief. Some philosophers think externalist views of content have implica- tions for traditional philosophical problems such as skepticism about the external world. Such skepticism often results from reflection on scenarios such as the \u201cbrain in a vat\u201d, discussed in Chapter 27. You think you have a body. But you might be just a brain in a vat being fed information by a complicated computer. Everything would seem the same to you. It looks like in such a case you\u2019d be radically wrong about the world. For example, your belief that you have hands would be false. But externalism complicates matters. Even though in such a scenario it would seem to you just like it does now, would you be thinking the same thing? If your thoughts are partially determined by your environment, maybe you are in fact right about things in that world. After all, in that scenario you do have virtual hands. One of the tricky issues raised by externalism is that, if our beliefs are determined by things outside of our heads, there is a sense in which we are likely to be insensitive to some of the features of our mental states. It might be that we could wind up rationally believing CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 138 complete contradictions. Chapter 28 considers such a case, and dis- cusses its implications for theories of content. Content isn\u2019t the only puzzling thing about propositional attitudes. There is also the question of what makes them the attitudes they are. It seems there are at least two types of attitude that can be usefully distinguished. First, there are attitudes like predictions, suspicions, and beliefs that, in some sense, try to get something right about the world. Second, there are also attitudes such as desires, hopes, and wishes that potentially lead the agent to change the world.",
