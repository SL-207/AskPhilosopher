    "paragraph": " This assumption is false for at least two reasons. One reason is that I can attempt to deceive a person into believing that some proposition I believe to be true is in fact true, not false, by giving him reasons for believing it to be true that I know or believe are not good reasons for his believing it to be true. This type of attempt at deception is perhaps most likely to occur in situations in which someone who believes that a given proposition is true ( 1) wants another person also to believe that it is true, (2) believes that he knows of no good reason for the other p\u0419rson's believing it to be true, and (3) therefore gives the other person reasons for believing it to be true that he believes are not in fact good reasons for the other person's doing so. Even if the reasons given the other person are in fact good rea\u00ad sons for his believing the proposition in question to be true, the person who gives the other person these reasons for accepting the given propo\u00ad sition is still endeavoring to deceive the other person if he believes that these reasons are not good reasons for the other person's accepting the given proposition. Moreover, even if the other person accepts the given proposition because he sees that the reasons given him for accepting it are good reasons, the person who gives him these reasons is still endeav\u00ad oring to deceive him if he believes that the reasons he gives are not good reasons. In such a case the person who gives what he mistakenly believes to be bad reasons for accepting the given proposition attempts to deceive the other person but does not succeed in doing so because the other sees that the reasons given him are good reasons for accepting the given proposition. If the person who gives the reasons in question is to succeed in deceiving the other person, the latter must accept the propo\u00ad sition in question because he is given the reasons in question but does not see that they are in fact good reasons.",

    "question": "What does it mean for someone to attempt to deceive another person into believing a proposition if they do not succeed in deceiving them?",
    "answer": "If someone attempts to deceive another person into believing a proposition but does not succeed in deceiving them, it means that the other person accepts the proposition because they have been given reasons for accepting it, but they are aware that those reasons are good reasons, and therefore they are not being deceived.",
