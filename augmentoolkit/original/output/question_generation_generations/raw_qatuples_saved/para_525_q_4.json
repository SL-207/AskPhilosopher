    "paragraph": " The difficulty can be brought out by considering experiences that differ considerably from those we humans have, such as bat echolocation experiences. THE CASE Many bats use echolocation to navigate their way through the world. Echolocation is a kind of natural sonar. Bats emit high-pitched chirp- ing sounds, and the sound waves bounce off objects in their environ- ment. That provides bats with information about where those objects are located. It seems reasonable to suppose that echolocation is a form of conscious perception. If so, there must be something it\u2019s like for a bat to echolocate, just as there\u2019s something it\u2019s like for humans to see red or to smell a rose. But what is it like? How does echolocating feel to bats? 5 What It\u2019s Like to Be a Bat 27 According to Thomas Nagel (1974), bat echolocation illustrates a problem for physicalism. The problem begins with the claim that it seems to be impossible for humans to imagine what it\u2019s like to be an echolocating bat. Try it. There is no good reason to think it\u2019s much like anything with which you\u2019re familiar. So, it seems, you don\u2019t have the resources you need to do the imaginative work. Probably you can imagine yourself growing wings, flying, and even hunting mosquitos. But that\u2019s not enough to capture what it feels like for bats to echolo- cate. Since we can\u2019t experience what it\u2019s like to be a bat, and since we also can\u2019t imagine it, Nagel thinks we can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for bats to echolocate. So far, physicalism is unthreatened. After all, physicalism is a theory about what consciousness is, not a theory about what we can and can- not know or imagine. But a threat lurks nearby. If physicalism is true, then the nature of bat echolocation experiences is something that should be explicable in objective, scientific (e.g., neurophysiological) terms. So, to understand the nature of those experiences, we shouldn\u2019t have to adopt the bat\u2019s viewpoint.",

    "question": "What does the challenge posed by bat echolocation suggest about the nature of consciousness and physicalism?",
    "answer": "It suggests that physicalism, as a theory about the nature of consciousness, may require a re-examination of its relationship with subjective experience and the limits of human perception and imagination.",
