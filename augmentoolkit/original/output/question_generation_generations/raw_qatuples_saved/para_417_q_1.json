But some question the basis for Quine\u2019s rejection of that assumption. A commonsense response to Quine\u2019s argument is to say, \u201cHey, I know what my words mean, at least sometimes.\u201d That response won\u2019t convince Quineans. They will complain that it assumes that meaning is at least partly a psychological matter, known by the speaker\u2014and again, for Quine, meaning is not at all a psychological matter. Mean- ing is a matter of patterns of stimuli and response and is best under- stood from an objective, scientific viewpoint. You might well associate the words you use with psychological states you have. But those states do not figure directly in linguistic meaning. Instead, their linguistic role is only to produce responses to relevant stimuli. Nevertheless, some (Searle 1983, Blackburn 1984, Glock 2003) de- fend versions of that commonsense response. For example, according to John Searle, Quine\u2019s argument is best regarded as a reductio ad ab- surdum (that is, a reduction to absurdity) of the assumptions on which it is based. As noted above (in the background section), Quine\u2019s argu- ment begins with the behaviorist assumption that linguistic meaning is entirely a non-psychological matter, and instead concerns objective facts about physical dispositions to respond to external stimuli. Given that assumption, Quine\u2019s indeterminacy doctrine does indeed follow. Rabbits and Rabbit Stages 143 But that just shows that we should reject the assumption. If we ac- cepted the indeterminacy doctrine, then distinctions that we know independently to be perfectly legitimate would be undermined. For example, we know independently that there is a difference between the tribe-member\u2019s meaning rabbit and her meaning rabbit stage. Yet, under Quine\u2019s behaviorist assumption, that difference disappears.",

    "question": "What is the response to Quine's argument that some people give, and why would Quineans not be convinced by this response?",
    "answer": "The response is \"Hey, I know what my words mean, at least sometimes\", but Quineans would not be convinced by this response because it assumes that meaning is at least partly a psychological matter, known by the speaker. Quineans believe that meaning is not a psychological matter, but rather an objective, scientific fact.",
