    "paragraph": " The idea here is that feeling hot and believing that one feels hot are in fact the same mental state. If this is so, then one cannot easily mistake that one feels hot when one does. This response at most mitigates Williamson\u2019s argument to some degree because intuitively many (perhaps most) of our mental states are not self-presenting in this sense. Yet another response involves arguing that safety from error isn\u2019t really necessary for knowledge (Vogel 2010). That is to say, this way of responding argues that it is possible to know that p in a particular circumstance, C, even if it is not the case that in every situation that is sufficiently similar to C, one wouldn\u2019t falsely believe that p. Without ANTI-LUMINOSITY 93 this safety from error requirement, Barry\u2019s case fails to show that our mental states (even at the borders) aren\u2019t luminous. A final response is to maintain that, contrary to Williamson\u2019s claims, the anti-luminosity argument undergirded by cases like those of Barry employs the same sort of reasoning as the Sorites Paradox (this is the sort of paradox where it seems that a single grain of sand can\u2019t by itself make the difference between having a heap of sand and not having a heap of sand, but it is clear that if we add enough single grains of sand, eventually we end up with a heap of sand) (Cohen 2010). This response contends that just as the Sorites Paradox in its various forms improperly exploits the vagueness of terms such as \u201cheap\u201d, the \u00adconsiderations in favor of anti-luminosity exploit vagueness in terms like \u201cknows\u201d and \u201cfeels hot\u201d.
