    "paragraph": " That it might seem so is espe\u00ad cially so in the case of those who believe that there is a single systematic comprehensive hierarchy of specific duties and values of the sort indi\u00ad cated above, that we can acquire knowledge of such a system, and that in concrete situations we can discover what the right thing to do is, and which of the various values possible in such situations we ought to attempt to realize, simply by applying our knowledge of this system to our own existential situation. If, however, the considerations presented above are acceptable, such beliefs are unrealistically optimistic. The opposite of such an unrealistically optimistic position would be the pes\u00ad simistic skeptical view that denies not only the possibility of the exis\u00ad tence of a single systematic hierarchy of duties and values, and thus also the possibility of our acquiring any knowledge of such a system, but also the possibility of our acquiring even the more modest sort of knowledge indicated above. If the considerations advanced above are acceptable, these two extreme positions are unacceptable, the first because it is unrealistically optimistic, the second because it is unrealis\u00ad tically pessimistic. 5. Self-Deception Thus far we have considered only attempts to deceive others and have not considered attempts to deceive oneself. It might be thought that attempts to deceive oneself are morally worse than attempts to deceive others. One argument that might be advanced in support of such a view goes as follows. It would be good if everyone were so constituted that each person could bear to face with equanimity any truth that might confront him. In point of fact, however, some people cannot bear to face certain truths. Some cannot bear to face certain truths about them\u00ad selves, some cannot bear to face certain truths about certain of the per\u00ad sons they love, and some cannot bear to face certain truths about the existence or non-existence of God and/or about human mortality.",

    "question": "What is the implication of the fact that some people cannot bear to face certain truths?",
    "answer": "The implication is that we should not assume that people can automatically acquire knowledge of a single systematic hierarchy of duties and values, or that they can easily apply such knowledge to their own existential situations. We should be more nuanced in our understanding of human nature and the complexities of decision-making.",
