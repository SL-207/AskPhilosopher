    "paragraph": " In 1965, doctors treating patients with life-threatening epilepsy decided to perform the same 44 Split Brains and the Unity\u00a0Puzzle 273 kind of surgery (called a commissurotomy) on several human patients. By \u00addisconnecting the two hemispheres from one another, the doctors hoped to prevent the seizures from spreading across the whole brain. These surgeries were extremely successful. Seizure activity was not just confined but virtually eliminated. The puzzle that we will discuss in this chapter arises from psycho- logical studies that were conducted on the split-brain patients follow- ing the surgeries. Although in everyday life these patients were able to function normally, the studies revealed a similar kind of divided consciousness as had been detected in cats and monkeys. Understand- ing the results of these studies and how they give rise to a puzzle requires a little more background on human brains and hemispheric functioning. First, visual and tactile input is delivered contralaterally\u2014 that is, information from the right side of the visual field or from the right hand goes to the left hemisphere; and, likewise, information from the left side of the visual field or from the left hand goes to the right hemisphere. Second, the two hemispheres tend to have different specializations. (In fact, much of what we know about \u00adhemispheric specialization owes to research done on split-brain subjects.) One specialization will prove especially significant to the discussion of this chapter: While the left hemisphere tends to have the ability to \u00adgenerate spoken language, the right hemisphere does not. THE CASE Consider a typical split-brain subject that we\u2019ll call Twain. Suppose that Twain has his left hand underneath a table, where it cannot be seen, and that we give him an object to hold, like a phone. Since the hemisphere responsible for speech does not have any access to the information about what the left hand is holding, when we now ask Twain what he\u2019s holding, he\u2019ll respond by saying something like \u201cI don\u2019t know.",
