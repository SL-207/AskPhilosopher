    "paragraph": " After all, Jon had no reason to suspect that he was in a horrible library, just as Martha had no reason to suspect that she was surrounded by barn fa\u00e7ades. Jon had no reason to think that the book he picked was relevantly different than the other books about Alexander just as Martha had no reason to think that the barn she was looking at was different from the barn fa\u00e7ades all around her. Further, Jon would have just as readily believed what the other books said about Alexander as he believed what the book he in fact read says. Again, this is just like Martha\u2014she would have just as readily believed that a barn fa\u00e7ade was a barn if she would\u2019ve looked at one of them instead of the actual barn. Hence, it seems that Jon, in a way analogous to Martha, came to have justified true beliefs about Alexander by luck. So it seems that just as Martha\u2019s KVANVIG\u2019S COMANCHE CASE 31 justified true belief about the barn fails to count as knowledge be- cause of its lucky nature, Jon\u2019s true beliefs about Alexander, though justified, fail to count as knowledge. Jon fails to have knowledge, but it seems that he does understand why Alexander was so successful. After all, Jon can accurately explain why Alexander was successful; he really does see how various facts about Alexander account for his success. What is more, Jon can ex- press his grasp of these facts in such a way that experts on the subject would think that Jon truly understands. So, it seems that while Jon\u2019s ability to have knowledge has been undermined by all of the unreli- able books he was surrounded by, his ability to come to understand wasn\u2019t. Thus, it appears that understanding is importantly different from knowledge. RESPONSES Although many epistemologists have followed Jonathan Kvanvig in arguing that understanding is compatible with forms of luck that undermine knowledge, not all have been persuaded by this sort of example.",
