    "paragraph": " We are left with no good reason to think that any particular proposition is true and no good reason to think that any particular method for determining which propositions are true is reliable. The particularist assumes an answer to (A**) and uses that to develop an answer to (B**). In other words, the particularist starts by assuming that various propositions are true and looks at what these propositions have in common to come up with a method for determining whether other propositions are true. The methodist assumes an answer to (B**) and uses that to answer (A**). That is to say, the methodist starts by assuming that a particular method for determining which propositions are true is reliable and then uses that method to figure out whether particular propositions are true. Of course, we might worry that just assuming an answer to either question is no good! Some supporters of these responses acknowl- edge that we must make some assumption, but they claim that this doesn\u2019t mean that skepticism is correct\u2014they claim that skepticism also has to start with mere assumptions. They point out that the skeptic must assume that we can\u2019t have an answer to either (A**) or (B**). There is, however, an additional response that seeks to avoid as- suming an answer to either question from the start. The explanationist proposes that we start with our intuitions about answers to (A**) and (B**) rather than taking answers to these questions for granted \u00ad(DePaul 1988, Moser 1989, Conee 2004, McCain and Rowley 2014). Next, this response says to make modifications until we end up in a state of reflective equilibrium when it comes to our intuitions (roughly, the idea is to use our intuitions to come up with the best overall answer to both (A**) and (B**) without assuming an answer to either question from the start).
