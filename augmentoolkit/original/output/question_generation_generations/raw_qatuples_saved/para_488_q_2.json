    "paragraph": " In treating the concepts of moral goodness and bad\u00ad ness, however, we are dealing with specific forms of goodness and bad\u00ad ness. These forms of goodness and badness can themselves, however, be explicated, at least in part, in terms of the specifically moral concepts already discussed. Such goodness and badness are predicable of three distinct types of entity-persons, overt acts ( including omissions), and psychological phenomena of various sorts such as likings and dislik\u00ad ings, val uings, motives, feelings and emotions, and desires, hopes, and wishes. The moral goodness and badness of persons is determined by that of their overt acts and that of the psychological phenomena predi\u00ad cable of them, since a person is morally good or bad in the respects in which and in the degree to which his acts and the psychological phe\u00ad nomena predicable of him are morally good or bad. The psychological phenomena predicable of a person are morally good, at least in part, in the respects in which and the degree to which they dispose him to fulfill his duties and thus to act rightly and as he ought, to respect moral rights, and from time to time to perform supererogatory acts, morally bad in the respects in which and in the degree to which they dispose him to act in contrary ways. In order, however, that psychological phenomena be morally good or bad it is not necessary that they actually issue in overt acts. Thus, for example, Moral and Non-Moral Value 79 particular instances of envy or hatred, even though they never issue in overt acts, are still morally bad in them\u00b7selves, especially if they take the form of desiring, hoping, or wishing that some evil befall the person envied or hated even though they never issue in an attempt to bring about such evil. Even if, in a world far different from ours, psycholog\u00ad ical phenomena never issued in overt acts they would still be morally good or bad in themselves, depending upon their intrinsic character.",

    "question": "What is the relationship between psychological phenomena and moral goodness or badness?",
    "answer": "Psychological phenomena are morally good in the respects in which and to the degree that they dispose a person to fulfill their duties, act rightly, respect moral rights, and perform supererogatory acts. Conversely, they are morally bad in the respects in which and to the degree that they dispose a person to act in contrary ways.",
