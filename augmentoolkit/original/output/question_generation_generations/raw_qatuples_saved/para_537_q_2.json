    "paragraph": " He might believe that it is an instance of some kind, but if he has no belief as to which kind it is an instance of, he does not, indeed cannot, value it as an instance of some specific kind as opposed to others. He simply values it as what it pre\u00ad sents itself as uniquely being. Thus the widow of our example likes and regards as good her dead husband's love for her, and good indeed it might be. But is it good as an instance of some kind and because it has to a sufficient degree various of the good-making properties of instances of that kind? If it is and if it does have such properties, the widow might neither know what kind it is an instance of nor what these good-making properties are that it has to a sufficient degree. Perhaps it is an instance of the kind consisting of a husband's love for his wife, and perhaps it is good because it is an instance of that kind. This, however, would seem to have things backwards. It would seem to imply that any instance of the kind consisting of a husband's loving his wife is good because the kind itself is good, whereas in fact if there is such a kind and if it is good it would seem to be good only because instances of husbands loving their wives are good. Kinds, that is, if good, are good because their typ\u00ad ical instances are good, not vice versa. A fourth consequence, or at least something suggested by the pre\u00ad ceding, is that when a person likes some indifferent thing it is fre\u00ad quently, perhaps usually, because of some special relation in which he stands to it, not because it is an instance of some kind or a member of some class. Each of us has experience or knowledge of many indifferent things to which we stand in no special relation, and ordinarily we are indifferent to them and neither like nor dislike them. If what was said earlier is correct, such indifference cannot be bad but is either good or indifferent. Had the bauble not been given her by her dead husband, and were she to stand in no other special relation to it, the widow doubtless would be indifferent toward it, and such indifference would not be bad.",
