    "paragraph": " For example, can our imaginings distinguish between a 100-sided figure and a 1000-sided figure, or is that a difference that can only be represented by some other kind of mental capacity? A related issue arises in the thought experiment of the speckled hen dis- cussed in Chapter 33: Can your mental image discriminate between an image of a hen with 72 speckles and a hen with 73 speckles? The remaining chapters in Part IV take up more contemporary issues. In Chapter 34 we consider a thought experiment that puts pressure on our standard taxonomy of mental states. This thought ex- periment seems to suggest that we need to accept a new category of mental states, called aliefs, that have a different kind of content from both beliefs and imaginings. In Chapter 35, we consider several thought experiments that have been put forth to suggest that percep- tion represents not just low-level features such as shape and color but also higher-level features such as being a particular kind of tree. The other chapters in Part IV don\u2019t concern thought experiments, but rather puzzle cases drawn from real life. In Chapters 36\u201338, we consider three puzzling phenomena relating to perception: synesthesia, change blindness, and blindsight. For people who are synesthetes, a sensory stimulation typically associated with one perceptual modality will automatically prompt or trigger an experience in another percep- tual modality. So, for example, a synesthete might experience differ- ent shapes as having distinctive tastes or experience different sounds as having distinctive colors. Blindsight is a phenomenon that occurs in some cases when an individual\u2019s visual cortex has been damaged. Though the individual will report having a part of the visual field in which they can\u2019t see anything, when forced to make guesses about ob- jects in that area of the visual field, they are able to do so with an accu- racy rate that\u2019s greater than chance.",

    "answer": "I'm not sure. While we can easily perceive low-level features, it's possible that higher-level features are also represented in perception.",
