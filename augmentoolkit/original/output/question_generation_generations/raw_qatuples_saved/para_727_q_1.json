    "paragraph": " By contrast, perhaps it is a physical necessity that there is no stable cubic mile of uranium-235; the laws of physics entail that such a thing would be unstable. But arguably the physical laws could have been different from what they are. If they were different, perhaps there could be such a mass of uranium-235. See also necessity. Metaphysics\u2003 The part of philosophy that concerns existence and identity. Examples of metaphysical questions include: Do souls exist? Is the mind identical to the brain? Is a statue identical to the clay of which it is composed? What, if anything, makes you the same person from one time to the next? Natural kind\u2003 A kind of thing found in nature. For example, water is widely considered a natural kind. So is the species tiger. \u00adContrast water and tiger with the kind being a zoo animal. Being a zoo \u00adanimal is a kind of thing, but it\u2019s not unified and natural in the way that water and tiger are. Natural kinds also contrast with artifactual kinds, such as table. Unlike water and tigers, tables are artifacts\u2014 human creations. Naturalism\u2003 This term is sometimes used for the theory that everything that exists is part of nature\u2014that is, that nothing is supernatural. Proponents of this theory typically reject views about the mind such as Descartes\u2019, on which the mind is an im- material soul that exists in a non-physical realm. \u201cNaturalism\u201d is also sometimes used for a methodological theory: the theory that the best way to understand the natural world is through natural science. According to a naturalistic perspective on the mind, the best way to understand the mind\u2019s nature is through the empirical methods, such as those employed by cognitive psychology. Glossary 320 Necessity\u2003 A proposition is necessary if it must be the case. For example, the claim that all frogs are frogs is necessary. By contrast, the claim that all frogs are happy is not necessary\u2014that is, contin- gent.",

    "question": "Do you think the physical laws could have been different from what they are?",
    "answer": "Yes, I believe that the physical laws could have been different from what they are. However, this is a matter of speculation, and there is no evidence to support the idea that the physical laws could have been different.",
