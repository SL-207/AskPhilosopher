    "paragraph": " The better we come to know a person the better we come to know his virtues. To come to know another is to come to know his virtues, just as to come to know oneself is to come to know one's own virtues. In one way it is easier for a person to come to know what his own virtues are and the degree to which he has them than it is to come to Persons, Things, and Value l 03 know what the virtues of others are ar:id the degree to which they have them. Each of us has a more direct epistemological access than others can have to various of his thoughts, feelings, and desires. We have an immediate access to our silent thoughts, feelings, and desires that others cannot have. Others can come to know what they are only through coming to know their outward facial, bodily, and linguistic manifesta\u00ad tions. Sometimes we come to know another person so well that, on the basis of our detecting certain subtle features of his facial expression, his bodily posture, or his speech, we ascribe to him various thoughts, feel\u00ad ings, or desires with such quickness and confidence that it is almost as if we had as direct an access to the inward phenomena we ascribe to him as to their outward manifestations. Even so, each of us has various inward thoughts, feelings, and desires that we do not reveal to others, either intentionally or inadvertently. To such inward phenomena only the person who has them has access. Not even the person who has them always has such access, since sometimes such inward phenomena go undetected even by the person who has them. To the degree, however, that each of us does have knowledge of his inward thoughts and expe\u00ad rience, he is provided thereby a way of coming to know various of his virtues that others do not and cannot have. This is because various of the virtues are manifested not only outwardly in what we say and do but also inwardly in what we think, feel, and desire. Thus upon learning of some misfortune that has befallen others in some distant place I might feel compassion for them even though there is nothing I can say or do that would alleviate their plight in the least.",

    "question": "Can you think of an example of how we can know a person's virtues without them saying or doing anything?",
    "answer": "Yes, for example, if someone learns about a distant tragedy and feels compassion for those affected, even if they don't say or do anything to help. In this case, the person's inward thoughts and feelings reveal their virtue of compassion.",
