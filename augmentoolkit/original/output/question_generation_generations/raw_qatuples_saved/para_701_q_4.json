    "paragraph": " The categories of universals and partic\u00ad ulars are species of objects. Objectives are sometimes, as by Ross, iden\u00ad tified with facts. The term \"fact,\" however, has different senses, to dis\u00ad tinguish between which it is necessary to distinguish between states of affairs, the obtaining and the non-obtaining of states of affairs, and propositions, each of which I take to be species of objectives. Universals, taken completely in abstraction from their exemplification by particu\u00ad lars, and states of affairs, taken completely in abstraction from the ques\u00ad tion of whether they do or do not obtain, are abstracta. I argue that ab\u00ad stracta have no intrinsic value at all and that it is only concreta, such as existent particulars and the obtaining and non-obtaining of states of af\u00ad fairs, that have such value. Although, however, only concreta and never abstracta have such value, the intrinsic value of particulars depends upon the nature of the universals they exemplify and that of the ob\u00ad taining and non-obtaining of states of affairs upon the nature of the states of affairs that do or do not obtain. In chapter 3, I present a discussion of the species of value and their relationships to one another. There are two major species of value-in\u00ad trinsic and extrinsic-and two major species of extrinsic value-instru\u00ad mental and contributory. These species yield the concept of total value, which is the conjunction of the intrinsic, instrumental, and contributory value a bearer of value has. The treatment of these species of value in\u00ad cludes a discussion of wholes and parts and of the world, taken as a whole. than which no more inclusive whole can be conceived. The chapter concludes with a discussion of C.I. Lewis' concept of inherent value and a rejection of this concept as useless for value theory. In the fourth chapter I argue that the concepts of value, of positive, Preface x1 negative, and neutral value, of intrinsic and extrinsic value, and of instrumental and contributory value cannot be understood unless the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness are understood, so that the latter two concepts are the central concepts of value theory.",
