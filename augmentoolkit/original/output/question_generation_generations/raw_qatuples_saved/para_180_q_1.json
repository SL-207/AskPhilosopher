    "paragraph": " Some epistemologists respond by allowing that these cases really are ones where knowledge is absent, but they argue that there are similar cases where the kind of luck in play here also undermines understanding (Grimm 2006). The thought here is that knowledge and understanding are both susceptible to luck. So, they stand or fall together, as it were. A different response to such cases is to argue (as we saw in the responses to A Strange County pp. 16\u201320) that the sort of situation de- scribed here isn\u2019t really a Gettier case at all. In other words, some argue that these fake barn-style cases don\u2019t undermine knowledge in gen- eral (Gendler and Hawthorne 2005). There have been some empirical studies that suggest that people don\u2019t generally have the intuition that the person in a fake barn-style case lacks knowledge (Cola\u00e7o et al. 2014). And, there have also been studies that suggest that people are happy to attribute both knowledge and understanding in such cases (Wilkenfeld et al. 2016). Hence, some argue that this sort of case fails to show that understanding isn\u2019t reducible to knowledge because it isn\u2019t a case where one actually lacks knowledge.

    "question": "Do fake barn-style cases necessarily undermine understanding, or can they be explained away as not being true cases of lack of understanding?",
    "answer": "Some argue that fake barn-style cases don't undermine knowledge in general, and therefore don't necessarily show that understanding is distinct from knowledge.",
