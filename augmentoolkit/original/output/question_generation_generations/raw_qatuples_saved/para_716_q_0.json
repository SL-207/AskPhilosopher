    "paragraph": " In doing so we pay an even higher compliment to the virtues and to being good than we do in striving to hide our vices from others, since in endeavoring to hide them from ourselves our motive cannot be to avoid suffering at the hands of others. Nor will it do to say simply that our motive is to avoid suffering at our own hands in the form of remorse, a loss of self-respect, or the recognition that we are bad, since such forms of self-inflicted suffering can occur only if we regard as good the virtues we believe we lack and as bad the vices we believe we have. I cannot suffer remorse unless I believe that I have acted badly or wrongly, I cannot believe that I am bad unless I believe that I have var\u00ad ious vices or do not have various virtues, and I cannot suffer a loss of self-respect unless I believe that the person I am does not merit respect. The term \"self-respect\" can be misleading, since it might suggest that such respect consists simply of my respecting the person I believe I am. I cannot, however, respect the person I believe I am unless I believe that I am the kind of person who merits respect, nor can I lose my self\u00ad respect unless I believe that I am no longer the kind of person who merits respect. I can have self-respect only to the degree that I believe that I have various of the virtues to some acceptable degree, that I usu\u00ad ally act rightly or well, and thus that I am a good person at least to some degree. And I cannot lose my self-respect unless I believe that I no longer have ( or have never had) to an acceptable degree various of the virtues, that too frequently I act badly or wrongly, and thus that I am closer to being a bad person than a good one. Both self-respect and the loss of it therefore require that the person who has or loses it value something other than himself. He must value being a certain kind of person regardless of whether he believes that he is that kind of person.",
