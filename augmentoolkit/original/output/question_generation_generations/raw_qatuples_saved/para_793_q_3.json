Philosophical Quarterly 99: 251\u2013275. 25 AVOCADOS ARE HEALTHY, BUT I FORGOT WHY (FORGOTTEN\u00a0EVIDENCE) Background: Recall that a prominent form of internalism, evidentialism, claims that what a person is justified in believing at any particular time depends upon the evidence that the person has at that time (General Background: The Nature of Justification pp. 113\u2013119). The idea that one\u2019s justification is dependent upon evidence or reasons that one has at a particular time isn\u2019t simply a feature of evidentialism though. This is a widespread commitment of most forms of internalism. And, some forms of externalism are committed to this claim as well. After all, there are some forms of externalism that require that one have evidence in order to have justification (see the responses section of Psychic Powers pp. 125\u2013128). On all of these views of justification, it seems that if one doesn\u2019t have evidence for believing that p at a particular time, then if S believes that p at that time, the belief is unjustified.",

    "answer": "This idea is a widespread commitment of many forms of internalism and externalism, suggesting that having evidence or reasons is a necessary condition for justification.",
