    "paragraph": " But, how can we be sure? Let\u2019s consider two possibilities. First, the universe is as we think it is. Second, the universe and everything in it is exactly as it is right now, but instead of being 14 billion years old it popped into existence five minutes ago. Of course, you might immediately respond by pointing out that it doesn\u2019t seem like the universe is the sort of thing that could have simply popped into existence a few minutes ago. But, why not? There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything logically contradictory about the idea of the universe coming into existence a few minutes ago looking as if it were much older and filled with people, such as yourself, who have lots of false memories about a more distant past. How could you tell the difference between the five minutes old universe and the RUSSELL\u2019S FIVE MINUTES OLD UNIVERSE 67 14\u00a0billion years old universe? Your memories (and everyone else\u2019s) would be indistinguishable in the two scenarios. Any evidence that you could point to as reason for thinking that the universe is 14 bil- lion years old would be present in both scenarios\u2014it\u2019s just that in one scenario the evidence is genuine and in the other it is misleading. Given that the two situations are empirically indistinguishable, why should we think we\u2019re in one rather than the other? The possibility of the five minutes old universe seems to generate a \u00adskeptical challenge that is similar in some ways to external world \u00adskepticism (see Descartes\u2019 Demon pp. 55\u201360 and Descartes\u2019 Dream pp.\u00a061\u201365). Of course, there is one difference between these two kinds of skepti- cism that immediately stands out. The skeptical challenge here doesn\u2019t cast doubt on your knowledge of the world around you. After all, even if the universe is only five minutes old, it doesn\u2019t follow that your senses are deceiving you or that you are merely having a vivid dream. So, you could still know that you are reading this book right now, for example.",
