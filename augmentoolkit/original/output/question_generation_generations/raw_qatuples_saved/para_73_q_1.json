    "paragraph": " Why do I have an experience of searing pain, as opposed to an experience of a light tickle, or as opposed to no experience at all, when a particu- lar group of neurons fire? Answering this kind of question has been singled out many philosophers as being uniquely hard, perhaps even unsolvable. Patricia Churchland disagrees. In her view, insofar as this assessment seems plausible, it\u2019s only because we\u2019ve been hornswoggled. To be hornswoggled is to be deceived or cheated\u2014as Churchland puts it, it\u2019s \u201cto be fooled by something because you\u2019ve been insuffi- ciently sceptical. To be hornswoggled is to be sold a bill of goods, that once you\u2019ve bought, turn out to be worthless\u201d (2022, p. 81). In de- fending the charge of hornswoggling, she offers numerous examples drawn from the history of science designed to show that much of the 10 CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 56 contemporary philosophical discussion of consciousness is based on a misconception of scientific progress and how it can be achieved. We\u2019ll focus on one of her examples drawn from the history of astrophysics. THE CASE Consider a typical team of astronomers in the late 18th century. One thing they\u2019re studying is planetary orbits. Planets orbiting the sun do so in an elliptical fashion. But these orbits are not perfectly elliptical in nature. The point of the orbit where a planet is closest to the sun\u2014 called the perihelion\u2014does not always occur at exactly the same place. This rotational change in the orbit is called a precession. The orbital precessions of the planets could be predicted and explained within the context of Newtonian theories, with one exception: Mercury. Though Newton\u2019s theories predict that Mercury\u2019s orbit will have a precession of 5557 seconds of arc per century, in fact the precession of Mercury\u2019s orbit is 5600 seconds of arc per century. This discrepancy of 43 seconds poses a puzzle to the 18th-century astronomers, but they\u2019re not overly concerned by it.",
