    "paragraph": " all of which are essentially intentional. The second-order phenomenon of my being ashamed of the first\u00ad order phenomenon of my liking to look at the accident victims can itself become the object of a third-order phenomenon. This would happen if I come to regard my being ashamed as being appropriate, fitting, right, or good. If I do so come to regard it, I might also come to like my being ashamed as something that is appropriate, fitting, right, or good. If so, then we have a series consisting of a liking, a disliking, and then a liking. First I like looking at the accident victims. This is followed by my being ashamed of this first liking. In being ashamed of the first liking I might come to dislike it. Being ashamed is an essentially painful phe\u00ad nomenon, and in being ashamed I might come to dislike something that initially I liked. So long, however, as my being ashamed does not itself become an object for me, it remains an essentially painful experience. I am pained that I liked doing something that now, because of my being ashamed, and perhaps also because of the pain essentially tied to my being ashamed, I dislike having done. Once, however, my being ashamed becomes an object for me, I might, but need not, come to regard it as appropriate, fitting, right, or good. If I do not come so to regard it, I might continue to be ashamed and to suffer the essentially accompanying pain. But if I do so come to regard it, the pain of my being ashamed might be lessened and might even disappear entirely as the satisfaction from so regarding it grows. In this way I might come finally to like my disliking of what initially I liked. Higher-order phenomena presuppose those of lower-order, at least as intentional objects, whereas those of lower-order do not presuppose those. of higher-order. This is to say that lower-order phenomena can exist or occur without being objects of those of higher-order, whereas those of higher-order cannot exist or occur without having those of lower-order as their objects.",

    "question": "Can a person ultimately come to like their disliking of something they initially liked?",
    "answer": "Yes, a person may come to like their disliking of something they initially liked if they come to regard their shame as appropriate, fitting, right, or good. This is an example of a higher-order phenomenon where a person comes to like something they initially disliked.",
