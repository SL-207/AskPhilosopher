    "paragraph": " Even if they can\u2019t assign a precise expected value to the option of transitioning, given how low the expected value of not transitioning is, they don\u2019t need to be able to do an exact calculation. Moreover, even if they can\u2019t predict exactly the ways in which the transition will allow for authenticity, they can also be certain that a future in which they don\u2019t transition is worse since, in that future, there is no possibility of authenticity. In such cases, then, the choice to transition can be made both rationally and authentically. Focusing on the parenthood case, Elizabeth Barnes (2015b) offers a related line of argument. Pointing to people (herself included) who have never had any desire to have children, she argues that their choice not to become parents can be rational even if they can\u2019t know what having children is like. As Barnes notes, Paul herself admits that one can rationally choose not to be attacked by a shark even if one doesn\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s like to be attacked by a shark. In Barnes\u2019 view, the decision of whether to become a parent has more in common with the shark-attack case than Paul thinks. Granted, there are differ- ences. Even people who in advance didn\u2019t want to be attacked by a shark don\u2019t report afterwards that they are so glad they did so anyhow, whereas many people who in advance didn\u2019t want to have children do report afterwards that they are glad they did so anyhow. But that glad- ness results, in part, from various fairly dramatic changes in character. Sometimes, one can be rational in knowing that one wouldn\u2019t want one\u2019s character to change in such dramatic ways\u2014ways that would be alien to one\u2019s current sense of self. Valuing the way that one is at present, and engaging in character planning in line with that, can be rational. So, in some cases at least, one can rationally decide not to have children even without knowing what the experience is like.",

    "question": "Can you describe a way to make a decision about having children that is based on your current values and desires?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can value the way you are at present and engage in character planning in line with that. This means considering whether having children would alter your character in ways that you don't want, and making a decision based on your current values and desires.",
