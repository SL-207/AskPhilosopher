    "paragraph": " On Puccetti\u2019s view, not only are the split-brain subjects two persons, but all of us are really two persons\u2014even those of us whose hemispheres are connected. (For a related view, which is developed independent of the split-brain cases, see Lewis 1976.) Denial of the second claim also resonates with a line of argumen- tation offered by Derek Parfit (1984, 1987) in support of the claim that we shouldn\u2019t think that personal identity is what matters in our continued survival through time (see Chapter 42). If there is not a single person post-commissurotomy, then there is no person existing who is identical to the person pre-commissurotomy. The two persons post-commissurotomy are not identical to one another, so the person pre-commissurotomy cannot be identical to them both, and there are no grounds to identify the person with one rather than the other. But, even if personal identity is lost, we can say that the person prior to the commissurotomy survives as both people; and, on Parfit\u2019s view, this kind of survival supports everything that matters to us in thinking about our futures. Attempts to resolve the puzzle by rejecting claim 3, the one-mind- per-person principle, have been relatively rare. But Schechter (2018) has recently mounted an extended defense of this option. While rec- ognizing that her approach may seem initially to be deeply revisionary of our notion of persons, she suggests that the denial of this principle is more in line with other things that we believe about persons than we might expect. Central to Schechter\u2019s argument is the notion of self-consciousness. On her view, once we properly understand the way that self-consciousness operates in the split-brain subject where there are two minds, we will see that it is not so very different from the way that self-consciousness operates in more ordinary cases, \u00adsuggesting that there might be two minds there as well.",

    "question": "Do you think that we have one person or two persons?",
    "answer": "I, as the answerer, do not have a definitive answer to this question. However, I can provide some context that might influence one's opinion on this matter. If we accept that split-brain subjects can have two persons, then it becomes more plausible that we all have two persons, even if our hemispheres are connected.",
