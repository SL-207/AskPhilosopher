    "paragraph": " Proponents of reliabilism seek to block such cases as counting as justified without giving up on reliabilism completely. One response that reliabilists make to this sort of problem proposes that reliabilism be supplemented with a condition that requires that one\u2019s be- lief not be defeated in order to be justified (Goldman 1986). Roughly, the way that this response handles cases like that of Ms. Cleo is to argue that although her belief is produced by a reliable \u00adbelief-forming process, it is not justified because she has available to her other reliable belief-forming processes that if she were to have used them she wouldn\u2019t believe that the current mayor of New York City is visiting Los Angeles right now. For instance, if she were to use the \u00adbelief-forming process that leads her to not believe things that simply pop into her mind, she wouldn\u2019t have a belief about the current mayor of New York City\u2019s whereabouts. Another response argues that the problem here is that Ms. Cleo has no evidence for the belief about the mayor\u2019s location. So, this CLAIRVOYANCE CASES 127 response insists that reliabilism should incorporate an evidentialist component (Comesa\u00f1a 2010). The general idea is that justification for believing p is like evidentialists claim, a matter of having evi- dence in support of p, but like reliabilists claim justification requires reliability. This response maintains that whether something counts as evidence for p depends upon whether it is a reliable indicator that p is true, i.e. when someone has that item of evidence, most of the time p is true. On this response, Ms. Cleo fails to have justification because she lacks sufficient evidence where \u201cevidence\u201d is understood in reliabilist terms. Yet another response involves arguing that although Ms. Cleo\u2019s belief is reliable, it is not formed in the correct way to count as justified. One way of developing this sort of response is to argue that only belief-forming processes that are sufficiently \u201cprimal\u201d can justify simply by being reliable (Lyons 2009).",

    "question": "What is another response that argues to block cases like Ms. Cleo's from being counted as justified?",
    "answer": "This response argues that the problem with Ms. Cleo's case is that she has no evidence for her belief about the mayor's location. Therefore, this response insists that reliabilism should incorporate an evidentialist component, which means that justification for believing p is like evidentialists claim, a matter of having evidence in support of p.",
