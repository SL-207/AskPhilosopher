    "paragraph": " Thoughts and perceptions thus cannot be explained by material operations alone. DISCUSSION Although it has been influential, many philosophers find the thought experiment of the mill and Leibniz\u2019s subsequent argument to be un- convincing. Part of the reason, though, is that it\u2019s not entirely clear what the argument is, or even what it is meant to prove (Lodge and Bobro 1998, Duncan 2012). If the idea is that when walking in the machine we wouldn\u2019t see thoughts or perceptions, the argument seems unsuccessful. Watching the parts of a thing work might reveal some of its properties, but there is no reason to believe we would vis- ually apprehend all of the properties or capacities of the whole (Rorty 1979, p. 26; Churchland 1995, pp. 191\u20132). From the premise that we can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d thoughts or perceptions in the mill, it does not follow that the mill contains no thoughts or perceptions. There are more charitable interpretations of Leibniz\u2019s argument. For example, instead of arguing directly that we can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d percep- tions in the machine, so they must not be there, he might be arguing as follows: If materialism were true, then what we would see in the movements of the parts would explain why or provide evidence that the machine had thoughts or perceptions. But none of what we would see in the movements of the parts would do either of those things. There- fore, materialism is false. That interpretation of Leibniz\u2019s argument might improve upon the one stated in the last paragraph. But it\u2019s not clear that it avoids the problem. Here again, it seems entirely possible that focus on the parts wouldn\u2019t show the properties of the whole\u2014 looking only at the movements of the parts might well obscure the Leibniz\u2019s Mill 11 purpose and potential of the whole. If one shrank down to the atomic level and wandered around a heart, it\u2019s doubtful one would know it was an organ, that it pumped blood, or even that it was biological.",

    "question": "What is a reason why thoughts and perceptions cannot be explained by material operations alone?",
    "answer": "One reason is that thoughts and perceptions involve more than just the physical movements of individual parts, and may involve complex interactions or properties that cannot be reduced to material operations alone.",
