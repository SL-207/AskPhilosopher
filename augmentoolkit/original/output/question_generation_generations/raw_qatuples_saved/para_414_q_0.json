Their independent l 76 The Nature of Value nature, that is, determines not only whether they are good or bad but also whether one is better than the other. Thus if either is good or bad, it is because of the nature each has independently of the other, not be\u00ad cause one is better or worse than the other. If either is good then liking it is also good and disliking it bad even though it not be as good as the other, and if either is bad then liking it is also bad and disliking it good even though it not be as bad as the other. 2. Extreme Views of Attitudes toward the Indjfferent In addition to first-order likings and dislikings, there are also what may be referred to as first-order \"indifferences\". Just as the object of a first\u00ad order liking or disliking is something liked or disliked that is not itself a liking, a disliking, or a being indifferent, so also the object of a first\u00ad order indifference is something toward which one is indifferent that is not itself a liking, a disliking, or a being indifferent. Thus just as first\u00ad order likings and dislikings require intentional objects that are liked or disliked, so also first-order indifferences require intentional objects to\u00ad ward which one is indifferent. Given that it is good to like good and to dislike bad objects and bad to like bad and to dislike good objects, a first-order indifference is bad if the object toward which one is indif\u00ad ferent is either good or bad. If, however, the object is neither good nor bad it is indifferent. Three possible attitudes might be taken toward an indifferent object. One might like it, one might dislike it, or one might be indifferent toward it. The question confronting us is this: Are such at\u00ad titudes toward indifferent things themselves good, bad, or indifferent?",
