DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-37 IMAGINING CHILIAGONS BACKGROUND Consideration of the many thought experiments explored in this book shows us that imagination is an important philosophical tool. Our en- gagement with these thought experiments seems to proceed via im- agination. But what is imagination? In most of the chapters, our effort to imagine a given scenario aims at teaching us something about the scenario under consideration. In this chapter, by contrast, we focus on our effort to imagine a given scenario with the aim of teaching us something about imagination itself. The imagined scenarios in ques- tion come from Descartes\u2019 Meditations on First Philosophy 1641/2017), where he explores the difference between imagination and what he calls pure understanding. This latter mental exercise is typically referred to as conceiving in contemporary philosophy, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll refer to it here. To help explain the difference between these two mental ac- tivities, Descartes asks us to engage in several mental exercises that in- volve consideration of various geometrical figures: triangles, pentagons, myriagons, and chiliagons. Though most readers are probably familiar with the fact that triangles have three sides and that pentagons have five sides, these other figures may be less familiar, so it\u2019s worth noting that myriagons have 10,000 sides and chiliagons have 1000 sides.",

    "question": "What is the relationship between imagination and understanding, according to Descartes?",
    "answer": "According to Descartes, imagination and understanding are distinct mental activities. Imagination is used to create mental images or scenarios, whereas understanding is used to grasp abstract concepts without creating mental images.",
