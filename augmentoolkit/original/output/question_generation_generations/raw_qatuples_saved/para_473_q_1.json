    "paragraph": " The reason for this assessment is that when we look at the long run frequencies of this sort of experiment, we should expect Beauty to be awakened by the experimenters with a heads flip about 1/3 of the time. Here\u2019s why. The coin and its toss are absolutely fair. So, the odds of the coin landing heads are 1/2. If we imagine that this experiment were run 100 times, we should expect (roughly) that 50 times the coin lands heads and 50 times it lands tails. Recall that if PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 224 the coin lands heads, Beauty is awakened only once, but if it lands tails, then she is awakened twice. So, this means that if the experiment were conducted 100 times, Beauty would be awakened 150 times (50 times when the coin came up heads and 100 times when it came up tails). The thirder position is that since Beauty understands these frequencies, when she wakes up Monday morning, she should think that the odds that the coin lands heads are 1/3. After the experimenters inform Beauty that it is Monday morning (and the coin actually hasn\u2019t been flipped yet), the thirder position contends that Beauty should revise her credence so that she now thinks that the odds of heads are 1/2. Why is this? Because Beauty knows that this is the first (and perhaps only) time that she will be awakened\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0experiment. Additionally, she knows that the objec- tive chance that the coin will come up heads is 1/2 (plausibly, she also knows that when it comes to long run frequencies, after being awakened on a Monday the coin lands heads half the time). To sum up, the thirder position is that when Beauty first wakes up her credence that the coin lands heads should be 1/3, and after she learns that it is Monday her credence that the coin lands heads should change to 1/2. The halfer position contends that when Beauty is awakened Mon- day morning (before the researchers tell her what day it is), she should have a 1/2 credence that the coin lands heads.",
