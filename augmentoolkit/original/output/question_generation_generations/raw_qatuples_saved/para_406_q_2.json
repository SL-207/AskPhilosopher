    "paragraph": " \u2022If, however, none of them is more evident than p, the fact that if they are true p also is true does not mean that the truth of p can be proved by appealing to their truth, since if their truth is no more evident than that of p the truth of p is not ren\u00ad dered more evident by appealing to them even though its truth be entailed by their truth. This seems to be the sense of \" proof\" Moore had in mind when he denied that any proposition to the effect that a given thing is intrinsically good can be proved. 4 Despite Moore, however, there do seem to be certain ways in which the intrinsic goodness ( or badness or indifference) of certain things can be proved. One way consists of arguing that a given instance of a given species is intrinsically bad because ( 1) the species in question is compre\u00ad hended by some genus, all the instances of which are intrinsically bad, and (2) it is more evident that all instances of the genus are intrinsically bad than it is that all instances of the species are bad. Thus, as will be argued in a later chapter, a given instances of pervasive dislike of indif\u00ad ferent things is intrinsically bad because ( 1) such pervasive dislike is comprehended by a genus labeled \"mean-spiritedness,\" all the instances of which are intrinsically bad, and (2) it is more evident that all instances of mean-spiritedness are intrinsically bad than it is that all instances of such pervasive dislike are bad. A second way of proving that a given thing, a, is intrinsically bad consists in arguing that it is the opposite of something else, b, that is intrinsically good. Thus in the chapter in question it will be argued that mean-spiritedness is intrinsi\u00ad cally bad because it is the opposite of magnanimity, which is intrinis\u00ad cally good. A third way of proving that a given thing, a, is intriniscally good consists of arguing ( 1 ) that it is an instance of the kind, k, and has prope\u00b7rties f, g, and h and (2) that any instance of the kind, k, that has the properties f, g, and h is intriniscally good because the possession of Definition, Proof, and Knowledge of Intrinsic Value 69 these properties by any instance of that kind suffices to make it intrinis\u00ad cally good.",

    "question": "What is one way to prove that a given thing is intrinsically bad, based on the idea that it is a member of a larger category of bad things?",
    "answer": "One way to prove that a given thing is intrinsically bad is to argue that it is a member of a genus (a largercategory) that is known to be intrinsically bad. For example, if a thing is a member of a genus that includes all instances of \"mean-spiritedness,\" and it is more evident that all instances of mean-spiritedness are intrinsically bad than it is that the specific instance in question is bad, then you can conclude that the specific instance is intrinsically bad.",
