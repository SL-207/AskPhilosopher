    "paragraph": "\" Such a response would not be of much help to the \"teleological\" egoist. He might by his use of \"my\" and \"mine\" mean only that a nec\u00ad essary condition of the goodness or badness of his experiences is that 1 66 The Nature of Value they be his. This would be unobjectionable, since a necessary condition of the goodness or badness of his experiences is indeed that they be his. If, that is, the experiences in question were not his but instead experi\u00ad ences of some other person, the goodness or badness of the experiences in question would not be the goodness or badness of his experiences but instead would be the goodness or badness of experiences of some other person. If, however, by his use of \"my\" and \"mine\" he intends to say that a necessary condition of the goodness or badness of any experience is that it be his, then what he says is objectionable, since it would amount to saying that no experiences of any other person can be good or bad. If, however, a necessary condition of the goodness or badness of any experience is that it be his experience, then he must have some fea\u00ad ture no one else has by virtue of which only his experiences, not those of anyone else, can be good or bad. It is hard, however, to see what such a feature would be. It cannot be simply his being himself, since every other person, also being himself, has the property of being himself or of being identical with himself. Another way in which the \"teleological\" egoist might attempt to defend his position consists in or involves a rejection of the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness. On such a view nothing is or can be good or bad in itself. Instead, to be good or bad is to be good or bad for someone. Thus the promotion of my interests is neither good nor bad in itself but instead is good for me, and the promotion of your interests also is neither good nor bad in itself but rather is good for you.",

    "answer": "Another possible way a \"teleological\" egoist might attempt to defend their position is by rejecting the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness. According to this view, nothing is good or bad in itself, but rather something is good or bad for someone. For example, promoting one's own interests is good for them, and promoting someone else's interests is good for that person.",
