    "paragraph": " BOOTSTRAPPING/EASY KNOWLEDGE 95 EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: BOOTSTRAPPING; PROBLEM OF EASY KNOWLEDGE Stew wants to check to see if his color vision is reliable, but he doesn\u2019t want to spend the money to go see an optometrist. Luckily, while browsing the internet, an ad for the \u201cBasic Knowledge Theory Vision Test\u201d (BKTV test), a very inexpensive home vision test, pops up. Stew orders the test and a few days later it arrives in the mail. The BKTV test is quite simple. It consists of a large stack of color cards (the cards are simply a single color; they have no writing on them nor any other identifying marks), and one completes the test by simply looking at the cards. That\u2019s it. Stew sits down and takes his vision test. It goes like\u00a0this: Stew looks at the first card, and it looks red to him. So, he knows that it\u2019s red. Stew thinks to himself \u201cThe card\u2019s red, and it looks red. Got it right! I\u2019m off to a good start.\u201d He looks at the next card, which looks blue. Again, Stew thinks \u201cThe card is blue, and it looks blue. Two for two!\u201d He contin- ues in this fashion for quite some time. Each time he looks at a card and sees that it looks a particular color, so he concludes each time that he has gotten it correct because he has basic knowledge of the color of the card (from looking at it) and he knows via introspection that the card looks that color to him. After going through a very large number of cards, Stew finally stops and thinks, \u201cI sure am glad I purchased this home vision test. Now I know that my color vision is reliable! And, I didn\u2019t have to waste the money to actually go to the eye doctor.\u201d What should we think about this color vision test? Does Stew really now know that his color vision is reliable? It seems clear that he hasn\u2019t gained a bit of support for thinking that his color vision is re- liable. However, basic knowledge structure theories seem committed to claiming that he did.",

    "question": "What is the problem with Stew's reasoning about his color vision test?",
    "answer": "The problem with Stew's reasoning is that he is relying on his own introspection about how the cards appear to him, and he is not using any independent method to verify the accuracy of his color vision.",
