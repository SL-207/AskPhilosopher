    "paragraph": " We will fill in some of the details later when looking at particular entries. That said, let\u2019s begin by taking a look at foundationalism. The basic idea behind foundationalism is that the regress of reasons stops. According to foundationalists, the structure of justification is like the structure of a building. A building has many parts that all rest upon a foundation\u2014so too with justification. All of our justification rests upon basic beliefs. These are justified beliefs that aren\u2019t them- selves justified by some other beliefs. How then are they justified? Most foundationalists claim that basic beliefs get their justification by being based on experience. Importantly, experience isn\u2019t itself something that can be justified or unjustified. Consequently, it doesn\u2019t make sense to ask for a justifying reason for one\u2019s experience. Hence, foundationalists claim that the regress of reasons reaches a stopping point. If your belief that the University of Alabama won the most recent College Football Playoff National Championship is justified, then the foundationalist says that if we trace your reasons back far enough, we\u2019ll eventually come to a basic belief\u2014a belief that is justi- fied by experience. Once we hit this basic belief, we are at the foun- dation and there is nowhere else to go and no more questions to ask about your reasons for the belief. Such basic beliefs are the foundation upon which all of our other justified beliefs ultimately rest. Coherentism offers a very different picture of the structure of \u00adjustification. Coherentists contend that there is an \u00adassumption about the \u00adstructure of justification implicit in the regress of \u00adreasons\u2014 the \u00adassumption that justification is a linear process. In other words,\u00a0the\u00a0\u00adregress of reasons assumes that justification is like a chain where\u00a0 the belief that q justifies the belief that p, the belief that 117 JUSTIFICATION p\u00a0justifies\u00a0the belief that o, the belief that o justifies the belief that n, and so on.",

    "question": "Do coherentists agree with the assumption about the structure of justification implicit in the regress of reasons?",
    "answer": "No, coherentists contend that this assumption is incorrect and that justification is not a linear process.",
