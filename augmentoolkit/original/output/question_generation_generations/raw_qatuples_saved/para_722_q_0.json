    "paragraph": " It is argued that there is no antecedent impartial concept of practical rationality that is neither ego\u00ad istic nor non-egoistic and that we can determine whether an egoistic or a non-egoistic view of practical rationality is preferable only by deter\u00ad mining whether an egoistic or a non-egoistic view of morality is prefer\u00ad able. This means that, rather than tailoring our view of morality to fit some antecedent view of rationality, we ought instead to tailor our view of practical rationality to fit an acceptable view of morality. Since, I argue, a non-egoistic view of morality is preferable to an egoistic view, we ought to adopt a non-egoistic rather than an egoistic view of prac\u00ad tical rationality. In chapter 9 the value of different attitudes that can be taken toward intrinsically indifferent things is discussed. Different possible extreme views and different possible moderate views of the value of various atti\u00ad tudes \u043aoward the indifferent are distinguished, and I argue that it is good that people like various indifferent things of which they have experience or knowledge, if for no other reason than that such likings are manifestations of magnanimity, instances of which are intrinsically Pref ace xm good, and that a pervasive dislike of indifferent things is intrinsically bad, given that such disliking is a manifestation of mean-spiritedness, instances of which are intrinsically bad. In the tenth chapter, which perhaps could be regarded as an appendix rather than a concluding chapter, I discuss some of the implications for higher education of the view of the complete human good presented in chapter 6. By distinguishing between ( 1) civilization and morality, (2) having goods and being good, and (3) moral and non-moral education, I argue that a non-moral education that seeks only to assist students in acquiring only one aspect of their complete good, by endeavoring only to increase their understanding of the various arts and sciences and to prepare them for various careers, is one-sided and inadequate and that the task of higher education is also to assist students in acquiring their complete good by helping them to become good persons.",
