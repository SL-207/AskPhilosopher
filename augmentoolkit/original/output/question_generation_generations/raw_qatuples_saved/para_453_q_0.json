    "paragraph": " The most common is to allow that such a scenario is possible, i.e. there could be a debasing demon, and it could mess up the bases for your beliefs in the way just described, but argue that this doesn\u2019t lead to widespread skepticism. One version of this approach argues that in order for the possibility of a debasing demon to actually lead to skepticism, we would have to accept the very im- plausible principle that any time we know that p we also know that we know that p (Brueckner 2011). After all, the possibility of the de- basing demon seems to threaten your knowledge that you are reading this book, say, indirectly by giving you a reason to doubt whether you know that you know that you are reading this book. It does this by giving you a reason to doubt whether you know that your belief about the book is properly based on your evidence. But, this response contends, this amounts to a threat to your knowledge that you are reading this book only if we accept that in order to know something you must also know that you know it. This principle (often called the \u201cKK principle\u201d) has been widely criticized in other contexts. Hence, this response maintains that the possibility of the debasing demon doesn\u2019t really threaten your knowledge of things like the fact that you are reading this book. However, it does seem to allow that the debasing demon poses a genuine threat to your higher-order knowl- edge (e.g. your knowledge of whether you know that you are reading this\u00a0book). THE DEBASING DEMON 79 Another version of this first sort of approach meets the challenge of the debasing demon head-on. This response simply argues that we in fact have a lot of evidence that our beliefs are properly based upon our evidence (Conee 2015). So, even though a debasing demon is possible, we have good reason to think that we aren\u2019t its victims. Hence, this response contends that the possibility of the debasing demon doesn\u2019t seem to threaten any of our knowledge.",

    "question": "What is the KK principle, and why is it criticized in other contexts?",
    "answer": "The KK principle states that in order to know something, you must also know that you know it. This principle is often criticized in other contexts because it is considered too stringent or overly demanding.",
