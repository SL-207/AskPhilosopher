    "paragraph": " From this, however, it does not follow that one person or group cannot help another to become good in one or more of these ways. Nor does it follow that one person or group cannot help another to become a good person. Just as one person helps another to become a good poet, philosopher, or scientist by teaching the other as much as he can about the discipline in question, so also one person helps another become a good person by teaching him what he can about what is involved in being such a person. Such teaching is not by itself sufficient to make another a good poet or philosopher or scientist. Nor is it sufficient to make another a good person. It is also necessary that the pupil attend to what the teacher is teaching him and endeavor to learn and practice and also improve upon what he has been taught. Such teaching is nonetheless helpful and sometimes necessary if the pupil is to become a good poet or philosopher or person. What use the pupil makes of what he is taught after the teaching is done is up to him. In recent years it has been, various of the professional schools that have given the most attention to teaching at least professional ethics through requiring or recommending that their students take courses in business, engineering, legal, or medical ethics. Liberal arts colleges have not given the same attention to teaching their students ethics through requiring or recommending that they take a fundamental course in ethics designed, at least in part, simply to help them become good or better persons. Such courses, however, though helpful, are perhaps not as important as it is that faculty themselves be good persons in their dealings with their students outside as well as inside the classroom. Young people become good or bad persons more by following the examples set them by their parents and teachers than by attending to what they are formally taught. And if their teachers themselves do not practice what they teach, their pupils have a most remarkable ability to see quickly through the hypocrisy.",
