    "paragraph": " PART IV PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION INTRODUCTION Much of philosophy of mind concerns big-picture questions\u2014for example, questions about the nature of mind or about the nature of consciousness. But philosophers of mind also devote considerable at- tention to more specific questions concerning various mental states and mental capacities. We have already explored some questions of this more specific sort, particularly in connection with belief. In Part IV, we explore a series of specific questions that arise in connection with perception, imagination, and attention. We start with three issues that trace back to the 17th and 18th centuries. In Chapter 30, we consider a thought experiment first pro- posed by William Molyneux in a letter to John Locke. This thought experiment explores the relationship between perception in different sensory modalities\u2014for example, between visual perception and tac- tile perception. In particular, we are asked to consider a person blind from birth whose sight is restored. While blind, the person could use their sense of touch to identify various three-dimensional objects such as cubes and spheres. Now with sight restored, would the individual be able to identify such objects purely by sight, without touching them? In Chapter 31, we consider a thought experiment owing to David Hume that explores the limits of imagination and sheds light on the de- bate about whether all of our concepts trace back to experience. Suppose that a person has seen all the shades of blue that humans can distinguish DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-34 PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 184 except one\u2014call it blue76. Could that person successfully imagine that shade of blue without having had any prior experience of it? Chapter 32 also takes up questions about the limits of imagination. Here we consider a thought experiment proposed by Ren\u00e9 Descartes that explores the extent to which imagination can represent fine- grained content.",

    "question": "According to David Hume's thought experiment in Chapter 31, is it possible for a person to imagine a shade of blue they have never seen before?",
    "answer": "According to Hume's thought experiment, it is not possible for a person to successfully imagine a shade of blue they have never seen before, as this would require prior experience of the shade.",
