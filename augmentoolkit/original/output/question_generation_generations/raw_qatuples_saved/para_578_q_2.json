    "paragraph": " The opposite of such magnanimity is manifested by the person who dislikes indifferent things, and it is because of this that such dislike is intrinsically bad. Dislike of indifferent things is a manifestation of a vice opposed to magnanimity, which perhaps may be called \"mean\u00ad spiritedness\". Other things equal, a person subject to this vice is a worse person than a person who is not so subject. Just as, however, few, if any, people do or can like all the indifferent things of which they have expe\u00ad rience or knowledge, so also few, if any, dislike all such things. Perhaps the type of person who comes closest to doing so is the type of aesthete who dislikes, or who pretends to dislike, anything and everything other than a pleasing aesthetic object. Such people are hard to please. Because of this they are less likely to lead happy lives than are those who like various indifferent things and are thus easier to please. 1 94 The Nature of Value Although a pervasive dislike of indifferent things is intrinsically bad and makes a person a worse person than he would otherwise be, an occasional dislike of something indifferent, though intrinsically bad, does not necessarily manifest the vice opposed to magnanimity and is sometimes understandable and forgivable and sometimes even lovable. Thus the widow of our example might dislike a certain indifferent make of automobile because it was a car of that make that struck and killed her husband. Such dislike, though intrinsically bad and doubtless also irrational, is understandable and forgivable, and few, if any, would take it as a manifestation of an absence of magnanimity on her part if they know that she is magnanimous in various other ways. And some old codger's intense dislike of a given indifferent thing or kind of thing, though irrational and intrinsically bad (although not greatly so), even though not understandable, might nonetheless have significant contrib\u00ad utory value as contributing to making him the delightful and lovable old character he is.",
