    "paragraph": " The virtues of a person are those good\u00ad making properties by virtue of the possession of which a person is a good person. An instance of a given non-human kind of thing can have certain of the good-making properties of the kind without having others. If it does, it is good in certain respects but not in others. So also, a person can have certain virtues proper to a person without having others. If he does, then he is good in certain respects but not in others. The virtues of a person are essentially dispositional. To say that a person has a given virtue is to say that he is disposed to act or feel in cer\u00ad tain ways in situations of certain sorts. Instances of various non-human kinds, especially instances of inanimate kinds, have various disposi\u00ad tional properties even though they never manifest them. Thus I might ascribe the dispositional property of brittleness, or being brittle, to a given glass windowpane even though it has never manifested this prop\u00ad erty and perhaps never will. This ascription is made on the basis of my knowledge of the brittleness of other glass windowpanes. Since many other glass windowpanes have proved to be brittle, i.e., have flown into Persons, Things, and Value 101 fragments when struck sharply with a certain force, I take it for granted that this glass windowpane is also brittle, i.e., that it too would shatter into fragments if it were struck sharply with the force in question. Given my past experience of glass windowpanes, I regard my ascription of brittleness to this glass windowpane as justified, even though it has never manifested its brittleness and perhaps never will. To be brittle it need never manifest its brittleness. The situation is radically different in the case of the virtues or good\u00ad making properties of persons. The reason, in part, is that various per\u00ad sons have various virtues. Although all, or nearly all, glass window\u00ad panes are brittle, some persons have certain virtues that others do not have.",

    "question": "Can a person have certain virtues without having others? If so, how does this affect their overall goodness?",
    "answer": "Yes, a person can have certain virtues without having others. If they do, it means they are good in certain respects but not in others. This suggests that a person's goodness is not an all-or-nothing quality, but rather a complex combination of various virtues.",
