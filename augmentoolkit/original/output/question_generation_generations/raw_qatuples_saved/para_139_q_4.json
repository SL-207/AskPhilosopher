    "paragraph": " Moreover, the \u00adsupersquid can \u00addetach its limbs from its body. This suggests that consciousness need not be spatially continuous; spatially discrete com- ponents can be integrated into a single conscious being. The second thought experiment \u00adinvolves a species of creatures \u00adSchwitzgebel calls the \u00adAntarean \u00adantheads. The \u00adAntareans, which look like woolly mammoths but manifest human-like intelligence, have a sophisticated society. Their society has a political structure, an educational system, social institutions like marriage, and thriving commerce. Interest- ingly, \u00adhowever, their brains contain not neurons but instead millions and millions of conscious antlike insects. The ant colony within an \u00adAntarean\u2019s head is wholly responsible for its behavior\u2014just as the mini-\u00adindividuals of the Blockhead are wholly responsible for its \u00adbehavior. This suggests that consciousness can nest. What does that show about the United States? On Schwitzgebel\u2019s view, the United States has all the types of properties that a materialist takes to be \u00adgenerally \u00adcharacteristic of conscious beings: it has sufficiently sophis- ticated information \u00adprocessing and sufficiently sophisticated behav- ioral responses. Thus, the only thing that would be keeping us from considering it to be conscious would be a prejudice against spatially distributed group entities. \u00adAccording to Schwitzgebel, if we accept that \u201cweirdly formed aliens\u201d like the \u00adsupersquid and Antarean anthead are conscious, then we should \u00adaccept that there can be consciousness in spatially distributed group entities like the United States.

    "question": "What does the idea of accepting the consciousness of spatially distributed group entities imply about your view of consciousness?",
    "answer": "If you accept that \"weirdly formed aliens\" like the supersquid and Antarean anthead are conscious, then you should also accept that there can be consciousness in spatially distributed group entities like the United States. This implies that your view of consciousness is flexible and open to considering a wide range of possibilities.",
