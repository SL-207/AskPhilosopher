    "paragraph": " When it was said above that a person acts rightly in a given situation only if he fulfills or at least does not violate his absolute duty in that sit\u00ad uation, the sense of \"duty\" and \"rightness\" used was that of objective duty and rightness. The terms \"duty\" and \"rightness\" are also, how\u00ad ever, sometimes used in a different sense. This is the sense in which a person's duty is to do what he believes to be his duty. In this sense of the term a person acts rightly only if he does what he believes to be right. This sense of \"duty\" and \"rightness\" may be referred to as subjective duty and rightness. Such duty and rightness presuppose belief about objective duty and rightness, sin\u0454e a person, in doing what he believes to be his duty and to be right, is doing what he believes to be his objec\u00ad tive duty and to be objectively right. Unless he believes that he has cer\u00ad tain duties and that certain acts are right regardless of whether he believes them to be, he could not believe that it is his duty that he act in certain ways rather than others and that he acts rightly and as he ought only if he does so. But although subjective duty and rightness presup\u00ad pose beliefs about objective duty and rightness, the former are not reducible to the latter, and a person, in doing what he believes to be his duty and to be right, might well be mistaken in his beliefs, and in acting on them might well fail to do what is in fact his objective duty and what is in fact objectively right. 8 Subjective duty and rightness are related to morally good acts ( or actions), since a person's act is morally good if he does what he believes to be his duty or believes to be right. Since, however, what he believes might be mistaken, his act, though morally good, might be wrong. If he is in fact mistaken, his act is morally good but objectively wrong. It is intrinsically good that his act is morally good but intrinsically bad that it is objectively wrong.",

    "question": "Can a person's subjective duty and rightness lead to a person acting wrongly?",
    "answer": "Yes, a person's subjective duty and rightness can lead to a person acting wrongly if their beliefs are mistaken. In this case, their act may be morally good from a subjective perspective, but objectively wrong.",
