Providing such an ex- planation involves at least two important parts. We might call them the general question and the particular question. The general question is: What makes a mental state about anything at all? This problem is clearest, perhaps, for the naturalist who believes that the mind is physical. Your liver, though a sophisticated and complex system, doesn\u2019t seem to have intentional states. And non-organic matter\u2014such as an outcropping of rock\u2014also doesn\u2019t represent anything. What, then, makes the brain, or some states of the brain, be about the world? The particular question is: Why are thoughts about the specific things they are about? What makes a certain firing of neurons be about Sarah\u2019s grandmother and not the little old lady who lives next door? Even if one isn\u2019t a naturalist, and one believes the mind involves some non-physical stuff or set of properties, the problem would still arise as we still need an explana- tion for what makes that stuff be about anything, and we also need an explanation for what makes it be about the specific things it is about. This section considers several puzzles concerning intentionality and content. Chapter 23 concerns the particular question, and stems from a puzzle developed by Quine: in any given situation, there are many candidates for what a thought might be about. Suppose one sees a rabbit hopping by and one thinks, \u201cOoh, a rabbit!\u201d We naturally think that thought is about a rabbit. But what makes the thought about a rabbit as opposed to something like \u201cconnected rabbit parts\u201d that are also right in front of you? Quine thinks there is no determinate fact of the matter. Chapter 24 might be seen as being more concerned with the general question\u2014or, more specifically, a certain answer to the general question.",
