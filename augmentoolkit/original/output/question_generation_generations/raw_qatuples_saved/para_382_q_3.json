    "paragraph": " In addition, the con\u00ad cept of better than is wider than the concept of good since, as was pointed out earlier, one thing, a, can be better than another thing, b, even though neither a nor b is good. For this reason too the concept of good cannot properly be defined in terms of the concept of better than. Two flaws afflict (3 ). It too seems to suffer from circularity, since in this context to say that x ought to exist or occur seems to be to say only that it is good that x exists or occurs or that it would be good were it to exist or occur. It also suffers from the fact that it employs \"ought\" in a loose and perhaps improper way since, as Prichard and Ross have pointed out,3 in the strict sense of the term the value of \"x\" in locutions such as \"x ought to . . . \" is always some moral agent. This certainly is the case when \"x ought to . . . \" is short for \"x morally ought to . . . \". A defect from which ( 4) suffers is that it is too narrow. The existence or occurrence of various things can be intrinsically good, yet the exis\u00ad tence or occurrence of a thing cannot be had by anyone, at least not in the sense of being possessed. Moreover, something such as a sunset might be intrinsically good because of its beauty, yet it is only the expe\u00ad rience of a sunset and its beauty that can be had by anyone, not the sunset itself or its beauty. Even if experiences alone and nothing else were intrinsically good, ( 4) would still be unacceptable as a definition of the concept of intrinsic goodness, since it begs the question of whether anything other than experiences, the nature of which is such that it cannot be had, can be intrinsically good. The fatal flaw of (5) is that it is too broad. This is the case because, as I shall argue in a later chapter, it is sometimes correct, fitting, or right to 66 The Nature of Value like or value in itself a given thing, x, and/or its existence or occurrence even though x be indifferent rather than intrinsically good.",

    "answer": "The flaw of definition (4) is that it is too narrow, as it only accounts for experiences being considered intrinsically good, and does not consider whether other things can be intrinsically good as well.",
