    "paragraph": " The idea here is that although Stew might know the card is red and that it looks red to him, he cannot use these two items of knowledge as evidence for thinking that his vision is reliable. Yet another sort of response to this kind of case argues that the problem lies in the fact that the reasoning that Stew employs assumes \u201ccumulative transitivity\u201d (Weisberg 2010). Cumulative transitivity is the idea that if p supports believing q, and \u201cp and q\u201d supports believing r, then p supports believing r. However, this response points out that cumulative transitivity fails in cases where the support provided isn\u2019t absolutely certain, such as in these cases. To see the failure of cumula- tive transitivity, consider this sort of situation. The fact that Stew did well on his term paper supports thinking that he has a firm grasp of the material. Stew\u2019s doing well on the term paper and having a firm grasp of the material supports thinking that he didn\u2019t plagiarize the paper. However, the mere fact that he did well on the paper doesn\u2019t, on its own, support thinking that Stew didn\u2019t plagiarize. Stew\u2019s doing well on the BKTV test is analogous to his doing well on the term \u00adpaper\u2014it doesn\u2019t support, on its own, that Stew\u2019s color vision is reliable.
