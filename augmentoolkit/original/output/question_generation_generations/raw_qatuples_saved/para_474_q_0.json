    "paragraph": " For example, it seems that you know where you\u2019ll be in a few hours. But, unfortunately, many peo- ple die suddenly and unexpectedly without any previous indication of illness. As morbid as it sounds, this can be understood as \u201cwinning\u201d a bad lottery. The odds that you will die in this way in a few hours are (thankfully!) very low. Nevertheless, do you know that you won\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d this lottery in the next few hours? It seems not. Yet, it seems that you know what you\u2019ll be doing in a few hours. But your know- ing what you\u2019ll be doing in the next few hours entails that you know that you won\u2019t die suddenly and unexpectedly before then. Let\u2019s think of another, much less distressing but still unpleasant example. Assume that you drive a car to campus as many students do at many univer- sities. After parking in the lot, you go to class. While in class, do you know where your car is? It seems that you do. After all, as long as you\u2019re not suffering from memory problems, you remember where you parked your car. But, cars are stolen every day and some cars are towed from parking lots even when they shouldn\u2019t be. Do you know that you haven\u2019t \u201cwon the lottery\u201d of having your car stolen or in- appropriately towed while you have been in class? It doesn\u2019t seem so. Doesn\u2019t your knowing where your car is entail that you know that it wasn\u2019t stolen or towed away though? Again, we have a case where it seems that you fail to know a lottery proposition, and yet it seems that you know an ordinary proposition that entails that you do know LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 82 the lottery proposition. To make the skeptical challenge here explicit, consider this argument: 1) If you don\u2019t know the lottery proposition (that you\u2019ll lose the lottery; that you won\u2019t die unexpectedly; that your car wasn\u2019t stolen or towed; etc.), then you don\u2019t know the ordinary prop- osition (that you won\u2019t be able to afford a new Lamborghini; that you\u2019ll be doing a particular thing in a few hours; that your car is in the parking lot where you left it; etc.",
