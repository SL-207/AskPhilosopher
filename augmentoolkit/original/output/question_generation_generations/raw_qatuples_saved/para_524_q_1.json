    "paragraph": " In Gertler\u2019s view, the sit- uation is irremediable. She recommends abandoning the internalism/ externalism debate. Another common response is to distinguish between two kinds of content: narrow and wide. For example, the propositional attitudes of Amari and AmariTE share the same narrow content but differ with re- spect to wide content. On one version of this response (Fodor 1987), the narrow/wide distinction roughly corresponds to the distinction Burge draws when considering the example of Alfred\u2019s apples: the distinction between mental content itself and the application of that content to phenomena in one\u2019s environment (for criticisms of that version, see Burge 1982, Stalnaker 1989, Block 1991). But on other versions, the Twin Earth and Arthritis-man cases really do involve two kinds of mental content, as opposed to one kind, applied differ- ently: the narrow kind, which all intrinsic duplicates share; and the wide kind, which is the kind Burge identifies\u2014content that depends constitutively on extrinsic, environmental features. The narrow/wide distinction remains controversial. For example, Yli-Vakkuri and Haw- thorne (2018) argue that there is no viable notion of narrow content. CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 158 The range of mental states to which externalism applies is also dis- puted. Burge argues that the range is considerable. Mental contents often contain concepts that are, as it is sometimes put, Twin Earth-able: concepts that pick out different things in different environments. Twin Earth-able concepts include at least concepts of many natural kinds (kinds found in nature, such as perhaps water, elm trees, and tigers), artifacts (human- made things), and much else. Arguably, not all concepts are Twin Earth- able. For example, it\u2019s hard to see how to tell a Twin Earth story about the concept of a friend or the concept of a philosopher. Another poten- tial exception is the concept of phenomenal consciousness, such as pain (Burge 2003, Veillet 2012; but see Ball 2009, Tye 2009).",
