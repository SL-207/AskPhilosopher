    "paragraph": "\u201d is too loaded for us to answer directly. Humans have too much bias against the machine. We are biased by the way it looks, by the mechanical sound of any \u201cvoice\u201d we would give it, and also by our basic knowledge that it is a non-biological entity lacking an organic brain. Turing thus suggests that we would do better to approach the question indirectly. As he argues, if a computer can successfully imitate a human being\u2014if it can produce the kind of performance in the imitation game that fools a neutral investigator\u2014 then we would have no grounds to deny thought to the computer. In his view, a computer that could pass the imitation game should be counted as thinking. DISCUSSION When Turing first proposed this test, he predicted that computers would be able to pass it within 50 years. That has not come to pass. Granted, computing systems have achieved remarkable feats, especially those that have been designed to focus on a specific task. Such sys- tems are often referred to as Narrow (or Weak) Artificial Intelligence (AI), and they are contrasted with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\u2014that is, systems that would be able to solve tasks and prob- lems across a wide range of domains. Narrow AI systems have beaten PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 100 human experts in contests involving chess, Go, and Jeopardy! They have composed music and written poetry that are in many ways indis- tinguishable from the kinds of music and poetry that humans produce, and they have created art that has sold for record-breaking prices at auction. But, despite an annual competition (sponsored by Hugh Loe- bner) that ran for 30 years and promised a prize of $100,000 to the first computing system that could successfully fool a panel of judges into thinking it was a human, no computer has yet managed to pass the Turing Test\u2014at least as at the time of writing; though, given the fast pace of current technological development, some iteration of the language model-based chatbot ChatGPT might well do so in the near future, perhaps even before this book is published!",

    "question": "What is the Turing Test, and what is the significance of passing it?",
    "answer": "The Turing Test is a test where a machine is assessed on its ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Passing the Turing Test would indicate that the machine is capable of thought, and would provide evidence for the existence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).",
