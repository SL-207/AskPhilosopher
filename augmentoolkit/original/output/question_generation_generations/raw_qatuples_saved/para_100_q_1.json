    "paragraph": "\u201d In the midst of all these barn fa\u00e7ades there hap- pens to be one real barn\u2014it is indistinguishable from the fa\u00e7ades from Martha\u2019s vantage point. When she sees it along with the barn fa\u00e7ades, she believes it is a lovely barn just as she believes of all the numerous fake barns that she sees. NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 18 It seems intuitive that Martha\u2019s belief about the real barn and her beliefs about the fake barns are justified. Martha knows what barns look like, she\u2019s looking at all of these fa\u00e7ades and the real barn in good viewing conditions (the lighting is good, it\u2019s a clear day, etc.), and she has absolutely no reason to think that Barn County is full of barn fa\u00e7ades. As a result, it seems perfectly reasonable for her to believe that each of these is a barn. This in itself isn\u2019t a problem because one can have justified false beliefs. But, consider when she looks at the real barn and believes that it is a barn her belief is not only justified, it\u2019s also true. Hence, when Martha sees the real barn it appears that she has a justified true belief. Nevertheless, it seems that Martha doesn\u2019t know that what she sees is a barn. Importantly, this situation is different from the original sort of Gettier case because Martha isn\u2019t making an inference. She simply looks and forms the belief that what she sees is a barn. So, it can\u2019t be that Martha\u2019s justification for believing what she sees is a barn is based on false reasons/evidence. What is more, the problem doesn\u2019t seem to be one with Martha or her reasons at all. The problem seems to simply be the environment in which she unknowingly finds her- self. The presence of the fake barns all around her seems to make it so that Martha doesn\u2019t know that she sees a barn when she is looking at the one real barn, even though her belief is justified and true. It appears that the Gettier Problem for the traditional account of knowledge not only arises when one relies upon justified false beliefs in one\u2019s reasoning, it also arises when one is in the wrong sort of environment.",

    "question": "However, if you look at the one real barn and believe that it is a barn, is your belief justified?",
    "answer": "Yes, my belief is not only justified, but also true. I am looking directly at the barn and have no reason to doubt its authenticity.",
