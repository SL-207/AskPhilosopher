    "paragraph": " But, even if there is no contradiction between the upload scenario and the soul theory, the upload scenario does not mesh very well with the way that soul theorists tend to think about souls. For example, souls are usually thought to be indivisible, so it\u2019s unclear how a gradual transfer would work. Moreover, given that the upload procedure proceeds by way of a data transfer\u2014with nothing really moving from one body to another\u2014it\u2019s not clear when exactly the soul would \u201chop\u201d over from one body to another, or why should we think that it would; and this unclarity arises even in cases where the data process is not gradual but takes place all at once. When we stop the thought experiment before the final twist, \u00adbefore the person beginning to wake up hears the knock at his door, many people share that person\u2019s own initial assessment of the situation: The upload worked to preserve Bhavith\u2019s personal \u00adidentity. He, the person in the bed with the android body, is Bhavith. But, just like the case of teletransportation mentioned in Chapter 39, the upload scenario raises a problem of reduplication, as we see in the final twist when Bhavith comes face to face with himself. The two Bhaviths share con- sciousness up to the moment of the upload; but, at that moment, their consciousnesses diverge. Bhavith-in-the-biological-body\u2014or PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 264 bio-Bhavith\u2014awakens from the scanning procedure before \u00adandroid- Bhavith does, and so has memories of a period of time that \u00adandroid-Bhavith does not. Moreover, at the present moment, they are each having different thoughts: \u201cHey I\u2019m looking at myself in the doorway\u201d and \u201cHey I\u2019m looking at myself in the bed.\u201d Since bio-Bhavith and android-Bhavith are not identical to one another, they cannot both be identical to the Bhavith who elected for the procedure, old-Bhavith (identity is transitive: if x = y and y = z, then x = z).",

    "question": "What does the phrase \"identity is transitive\" mean in this context?",
    "answer": "The phrase \"identity is transitive\" means that if x = y and y = z, then x = z. In other words, if two things are identical to each other, and one of those things is identical to a third thing, then the first two things are also identical to the third thing. However, in the scenario described, this transitivity of identity is challenged by the existence of two distinct Bhaviths.",
