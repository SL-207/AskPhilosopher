    "paragraph": " That is likely impossible in our universe, but not impossible in the broader sense that matters for philosophy. Instead, the reason that this sort of case is impossible, according to this response, is that perceptual states themselves involve (or at least entail) believing (Armstrong 1968). The thought being that when David has experiences of sitting in his armchair and watching TV, those experiences themselves are partly constituted by (or entail) beliefs. Hence, the response insists that it\u2019s impossible for David to have the exact same beliefs as Favre and at the same time have expe- riences as of sitting at home in his chair. This response contends that if David has experiences as of sitting at home in his chair, then these experiences bring with them beliefs. So, David could have Favre\u2019s beliefs plus the beliefs constituting (or entailed by) his experiences of sitting at home, but he couldn\u2019t have just Favre\u2019s beliefs in this situation. If this view of perceptual experience is correct, then in this situation David wouldn\u2019t really have coherent beliefs at all. So, co- herentism wouldn\u2019t be committed to the counterintuitive result that David\u2019s beliefs are justified. Finally, there is another response to this problem that is more com- mon among contemporary theorists that are supportive of coher- entism. This response abandons pure coherentism (where the only objects that need to be in coherence relations are beliefs) for a view that requires coherence among one\u2019s beliefs and the contents of one\u2019s experiences (Kvanvig and Riggs 1992, Poston 2014). On this version of coherentism, David\u2019s beliefs wouldn\u2019t count as coherent. The reason ISOLATION/INPUT OBJECTION 165 for this is that although the beliefs cohere with one another, they don\u2019t cohere with the contents of his experiences. And since both be- liefs and the contents of experiences belong in the web, David\u2019s web of beliefs fails to meet the requirements for justification.",

    "question": "What is another response to the problem of coherentism that some theorists have proposed?",
    "answer": "Another response is to abandon pure coherentism and require coherence among one's beliefs and the contents of one's experiences. According to this view, David's beliefs wouldn't count as coherent because they don't cohere with the contents of his experiences.",
