    "paragraph": " Instead, in the respects indicated the phenomenon of loving has positive value, that of hating negative value. One of the fun\u00ad damental reasons this is so is that in hating someone we are inclined to want him to be bad rather than good, whereas in loving someone we are inclined to want him to be good rather than bad. Wanting the object of our hating to be bad, we are inclined to seek out and to emphasize defects in him that would make him bad and to ignore or explain away any virtues he might have that would make him good. If we fail to suc\u00ad ceed fully in such an enterprise we might, hating the object of our hate as we do, ascribe to him various defects we have not detected and even come to believe that he does indeed have these defects. We might also seek ways of making him bad if we have not succeeded fully in con\u00ad vincing ourselves that he is bad or ways of making him even worse if we believe that he is already bad but not bad enough. The worse he becomes the greater our satisfaction becomes. The central theme coursing through our little phenomenological dialectic of the development of hatred is the desire of the hater that the 1 10 The Nature of Value object of his hatred be bad and the satisfaction the hater derives from his belief that the object of his hatred is indeed bad. It is important to remember that the object of the hater's hatred is a person, not a vice or defect of character, much less a virtue. Indeed, there is a sense in which the hater may be said to regard various of the virtues as good-making properties and various of the vices as bad-making properties. The hater wants the object of his hatred to be bad, not good, since if the latter is good rather than bad the hater's hatred cannot be justified. The hater would doubtless be regarded as joking if he were to attempt to justify his hatred by saying that he hates the object of his hatred because the latter is good.",
