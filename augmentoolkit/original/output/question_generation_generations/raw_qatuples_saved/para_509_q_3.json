    "paragraph": " A person who has certain virtues is even more virtuous than he would otherwise be if he not only exercises these virtues in situ\u00ad ations in which it is appropriate to do so but in addition does so at least in part because he believes that he has a duty to do so and thus that he acts rightly and as he ought to act in doing so and, moreover, when it is possible, also enjoys doing so. In certain situations, however, it is hard if not impossible to like exercising certain virtues. It is doubtful, for ex\u00ad ample, that Jesus enjoyed being crucified. Even, however, when it is hard or impossible to like exercising a given virtue, it might still be possible to take satisfaction in knowing that one is doing so. A person who is in the habit of exercising various of the virtues at least in part because he believes it to be his duty so to do and, when possible, also likes doing so is not only a virtuous person but also a morally good person. Such a Moral and Non-Moral Value 81 person not only exercises various of the virtues in situations in which it is appropriate to do so but does so at least in part because he believes it to be his duty so to do and, in addition, when possible likes doing so. If the preceding is correct, then moral philosophy, rather than being simply a branch of value theory, is instead presupposed in certain re\u00ad spects by the latter. This is illustrated by the concept of a good person, which is one of the concepts it is the task of value theory to explicate. Yet if the preceding argument is sound this concept can be explicated only by using certain moral concepts. This, however, does not mean that value theory is simply a branch of moral philosophy, since part of its task is to examine non-moral as well as moral goodness and badness. 2. The Value of Moral Objectives If the argument of the preceding section is sound, various of the con\u00ad cepts central to moral philosophy can be explicated without using the concepts of goodness and badness and thus without using the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badn\u0453ss, which are the central concepts of value theory.",

    "question": "Is value theory a branch of moral philosophy?",
    "answer": "Although value theory relies on moral concepts, it is not simply a branch of moral philosophy. This is because value theory also examines non-moral goodness and badness, in addition to moral goodness and badness.",
