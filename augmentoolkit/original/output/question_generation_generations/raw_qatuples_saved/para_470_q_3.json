    "paragraph": " And if to claim that it is good to be indifferent toward them all or that it is good to like them all is to imply that we have a duty or that we ought, in the first case, to be indif\u00ad ferent toward them all and, in the second, to like them all, and if such claims be true, then each of us has a duty that few, if any, of us do or can 1 82 The Nature of Value succeed in fulfilling, given that each of us does in fact like some indif\u00ad ferent things, dislike others, and is indifferent toward still others and would find it difficult in the extreme, if not in fact impossible, to adopt an attitude of indifference toward them all or to like them all. Regard\u00ad less, however, of whether such claims do have such implications, all our likings and dislikings of indifferent things would be bad if the only appropriate attitude to take toward them all is one of indifference, and all our dislikings of and indifferences toward indifferent things would be bad if the only appropriate attitude to take toward them is to like them all. The number of our bad likings, dislikings, and indifferences is already sufficiently great without adding needlessly to their number. It is because what I have labeled the \"moderate\" view does not do this but instead holds that it is good to like some indifferent things, to be indif\u00ad ferent toward others, and perhaps also to dislike still others, that it is more congenial to our actual likings, dislikings, and indifferences. There are, however, two versions of the moderate view, one of which may be referred to as the \"uniform\" version, the other the \"individual\u00ad istic\" version. According to the uniform version, all indifferent things fall into at least two and perhaps three classes. One class consists of those indifferent things it is good for anyone to like and bad for anyone to dislike or to be indifferent toward. Anyone's liking any member of this class is good, and anyone's disliking or indifference toward any member of it is bad.",

    "question": "How do the uniform and individualistic versions of the moderate view differ?",
    "answer": "The uniform version views all indifferent things as falling into at least two and perhaps three classes, whereas the individualistic version of the moderate view does not provide a clear classification of indifferent things.",
