    "paragraph": "\u201d But now suppose that we take the phone away (still keeping it out of sight) and we give him a box with a bunch of dif- ferent objects in it, including the phone. When we ask him to retrieve it, he can do so. Or if we give him a pencil (held in his left hand) and ask him to draw what he was just holding, he will produce a picture of a phone. One natural way to describe the case is to say that the right hemisphere knows something that the left hemisphere does not. PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 274 Other experiments with Twain reinforce the assessment that his two hemispheres are functioning independently of one another. Sup- pose we divide his visual fields and flash the word \u201cheart\u201d on a screen such that the letters \u201che\u201d present only to the left half of the visual field (and thus to the right hemisphere) and the letters \u201cart\u201d present only to the right half of the visual field (and thus to the left hemisphere). If we ask Twain aloud what word he has seen, he will say \u201cart.\u201d But if we hold up two cards, one of which has the word \u201che\u201d written on it and the other of which has the word \u201cart\u201d written on it, and we ask Twain to point with his left hand to the word that he has seen, he will point to the card containing the word \u201che.\u201d Again, a natural way to describe the case would be to say that each hemisphere knows something that the other does not. In ordinary situations, however, Twain functions more or less nor- mally. And this generates a puzzle: Is Twain a single person with a single mind, as he appears to be in day-to-day interactions, or he is two persons each with their own minds, as he appears to be in the ex- perimental situations? And, if the latter, when did this split happen? All the operation did was to sever a connection. When conjoined twins undergo an operation to sever the connection between them, the surgeons don\u2019t bring a new person into existence; rather, the surgeons separate two persons who already existed.",

    "question": "What would happen if you were to remove Twain's sight of the phone and then give him a box containing the phone, along with other objects? How would he retrieve the phone?",
    "answer": "Twain would be able to retrieve the phone from the box because he would be able to locate it by touch, even though he couldn't see it.",
