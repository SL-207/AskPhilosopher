    "paragraph": " Here the issue of whether she did in fact originate from g is not up for grabs. Instead, we are assuming that she did and asking whether there is a different way the world could have gone such that she did not. It should also be granted that we can imagine a woman who looks, acts, feels, etc. just as Queen Elizabeth does but who \u00adoriginated from g* rather than g. Such a thing is possible; such a woman might have existed. But, for present purposes, that too can be set aside. Our \u00adquestion was about a specific individual, Queen Elizabeth. With \u00adrespect to that question, it is irrelevant that there could have been a different woman\u2014one who didn\u2019t originate from g but had many of Elizabeth\u2019s other properties. The Queen and the Gametes 297 So, to imagine the Queen failing to originate from g is not as easy as one might have initially thought. But is that scenario possible? \u00adAccording to Kripke (1972/1980, p. 113), the answer is no: \u201cIt seems to me that anything coming from a different origin would not be this object.\u201d DISCUSSION Kripke\u2019s discussion of the Queen and her biological origins occurs in the context of his defense of the existence of a posteriori \u00adnecessities: \u00adnecessary truths (that is, truths that must be the case) that we cannot discover without empirical investigation. Prior to the early 1970s, when Kripke raised these issues, it had been widely thought that all necessary truths can be known a priori, by conceptual reflection alone. For ex- ample, one can know that all squares are rectangular just by reflecting on the concepts of squareness and rectangularity. What goes for \u201call squares are rectangular\u201d was thought to hold for all necessary truths: they are a priori knowable. Kripke rejected that view. His most widely discussed examples of a posteriori necessities concern chemistry and physics\u2014e.g., water is necessarily H2O, lightning is necessarily electric discharge, and heat is necessarily mean molecular kinetic \u00adenergy.",

    "question": "Assuming that Queen Elizabeth did originate from a specific gamete, g, is it possible to imagine a world in which she did not originate from that specific gamete?",
    "answer": "No, it is not possible to imagine a world in which Queen Elizabeth did not originate from the specific gamete g, because that scenario would imply a different individual, not the specific Queen Elizabeth.",
