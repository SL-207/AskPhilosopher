    "paragraph": " His love or hatred might instead consist simply in wanting the person loved to have certain goods or in wanting the person hated not to have certain goods. Speaking very generally, such goods can be clas\u00ad sified as the moral virtues on the one hand and all other goods on the other. We can therefore distinguish between being good, which consists in having various of the virtues, and having various other goods, such as health, wealth, intelligence, knowledge_, and facial and bodily beauty. This can be put by saying that a distinction can be drawn between being good and having goods. One can be good without having various goods, and one can have various goods without being good. The obtaining of a state of affairs co,nsisting of someone's being good is itself good, but the obtaining of a state of affairs consisting of someone's having various \u00b7goods might or might not itself be good, depending upon circumstances. If, for example, a person is not a good person, his having certain goods might not itself be good. Or if a person has done or failed to do something, and if his doing or failing to do the thing in question makes it bad that he have certain goods, then his having the goods in question is itself bad. Ordinarily, a person who hates another recognizes that being good and that having goods, except perhaps under certain conditions, are themselves good. Usually such a person does not regard being good itself or having goods itself as bad. Nor does he usually love being bad in itself or not having various goods in itself. Nor does he ordinarily hate being good in itself or having goods in itself. Instead, what he hates is that the person he hates is good or has certain goods. He hates the obtaining of the state of affairs consisting of the person he hates being good or having certain goods. He could not hate that person's being good or his having certain goods unless he believes that the obtaining of such states of affairs is good.",

    "question": "What does it imply about a person's hatred if they believe that being good or having goods is inherently bad?",
    "answer": "It implies that the person's hatred is irrational or mistaken. If being good or having goods is inherently good, then it is not possible to hate them in and of themselves. Any hatred of being good or having goods must be based on an underlying misunderstanding of the concept.",
