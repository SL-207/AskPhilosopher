    "paragraph": " People generally want their beliefs to be true and prefer understanding to ignorance. The fact that we generally do value knowledge and understanding also explains, I believe, at least in part, our uneasiness when confronted with skeptical hypotheses to the effect that we are only brains in vats or that we are constantly being deceived by Cartesian-like evil demons or scientists (in the seventeenth century by evil demons, in the twentieth by evil scientists).4 Why, one might ask, ought we to be troubled by the fact that our ordinary commonsensical beliefs about the existence of the material world, other minds, and the past might be false, given that we continue to be able in the future to satisfy our desires as well as we have in the past? The answer, I believe, is that one of our desires is to have true rather than false beliefs and understanding rather than ignorance. 144 The Nature of Value We want our commonsensical beliefs about the existence of the material world, other minds, and the past to be true not because their truth is necessary if we are to satisfy various of our non-theoretical or practical interests, but rather because their truth is necessary, given the difficulty if not indeed the impossibility of abandoning such beliefs, for the sake of our theoretical concern for knowledge and understanding. We want our intellect or understanding to be informed or well formed, not mis\u00ad informed or badly formed. Our concern for knowledge and under\u00ad standing also explains why James Rachels' conceited scientist, whose colleagues feed his conceit by concocting a gigantic hoax, never discov\u00ad ered by him, involving the conferring of various high honors on him, is such a pathetic figure. 5 Regardless of how contented and happy he might be in his conceited ignorance, he is pathetic precisely because of his false beliefs about and his ignorance and lack of understanding of himself and his importance.",

    "answer": "According to your values, even if someone is contented and happy, they can still be considered pathetic if they hold false beliefs and lack understanding of themselves and their importance.",
