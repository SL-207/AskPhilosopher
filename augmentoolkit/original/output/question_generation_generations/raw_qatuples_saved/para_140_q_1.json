For another, one could distinguish your knowing based on how the bricks look to you collectively and knowing based on how each brick in the collection looks to you individually (Tye 2009, p. 180). But even if Dretske\u2019s argument can be resisted, his conclusion might be true. There are ways to explain change blindness that are consistent with the view that conscious perception is rich. For example, one might suggest that change blindness involves (or can involve) what Ned Block (2012) calls phenomenal overflow: the subject has conscious experiences but cannot access them (or the information they provide) in ways one usually can. Ned Block (1995) has argued that other experimental results support the existence of phenomenal overflow. In one study he describes, by Georg Sperling (1960), subjects are shown groups of letters, for ex- ample, in 3\u00d74 arrays, for brief periods (e.g., 50 milliseconds). Subjects usually report that they can see all (or at least most) of the letters, but they can report only about half of them (see Chapter 38). Sperling then varied the experiment, playing a tone right after the display. A high tone meant that the subjects were to report the top row, a medium tone meant the middle row, etc. Subjects then were able to report the letters in the row indicated by the tone, but not the other letters. Block suggests that this case might involve phenomenal overflow: the subjects consciously saw all (or most) of the letters in the whole array but did not have access to all of the detailed information that their conscious experiences represented. If Block is right about that, then perhaps the same sort of thing happens in change blindness: the experience is rich, but the access is poor (Block 2012; see Chapter 28).

    "question": "What is phenomenal overflow, and how can it explain change blindness?",
    "answer": "Phenomenal overflow is a concept where a person has conscious experiences, but they are unable to access the information provided by those experiences in the way they usually can. This can lead to change blindness, where a person is unable to perceive changes in their surroundings, even though they are consciously experiencing them.",
