    "paragraph": " It seems that we face a skeptical challenge very similar to that posed by the possibility of massive deception (see Descartes\u2019 Demon pp. 55\u201360). After all, if you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re not asleep, then it seems you don\u2019t really know that things in the world around you are as you think they are. At first, we might be tempted to think that this sort of dreaming skepticism is not only similar to the sort of skeptical challenge posed by a deceptive demon or being in a computer simulation, but that it is the exact same thing. However, there seems to be at least one very im- portant difference. You have never met Descartes\u2019 demon, nor have you been in a computer simulation that is powerful enough to completely mimic your normal experiences. However, you have dreamed before! Hence, while you might think that the idea that you\u2019re being deceived by a demon or that you are in a computer simulation is ridiculous and so skepticism based on these possibilities should simply be ignored, it seems a bit harder to run this line of response to dreaming skepticism. It\u2019s not ridiculous to think that you might have a vivid dream that is hard to distinguish from reality\u2014people (perhaps even you) have had, and continue to have, such dreams. Admittedly, it is a big move from this sort of dream to a dream that completely mimics waking life to the point where you can\u2019t tell whether you are awake right now. But, a skeptic might respond by asking how you know that you\u2019ve ever been awake. Some people (again, perhaps you are one of these people) have dreams within dreams\u2014instances where they are dreaming and seem to wake up but that is all part of a larger dream. Given this, why think that you are really awake now rather than dreaming? Why think that you haven\u2019t been dreaming your entire life? DREAMING SKEPTICISM 63 If you can\u2019t be sure that you\u2019re awake, how can you know anything about the world around you?",

    "question": "Is dreaming skepticism as ridiculous as the skeptical challenge posed by a deceptive demon or computer simulation?",
    "answer": "No, I don't think so. While it's unlikely that I'm dreaming a complete and perfect simulation of reality, it's not impossible that I'm having a vivid dream that's hard to distinguish from reality. People have had, and continue to have, such dreams, so it's not entirely irrational to consider the possibility.",
