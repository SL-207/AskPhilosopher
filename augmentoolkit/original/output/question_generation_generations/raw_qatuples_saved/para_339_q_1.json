    "paragraph": "\u201d There are numerous interesting philosoph- ical questions concerning groups and group behaviors. Many of these are metaphysical questions such as how does a group have a belief?\u2014is this because each member of the group believes the proposition in question or only some of the group? There are interesting epistemological questions as well. Particularly interesting are questions of how groups can be rational and how group rationality can interact with individual rationality. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: JUDGMENT AGGREGATION Ted is a philosophy professor, and he is eligible for a promotion. As with most things in an academic setting, it is decided that the best way to determine whether Ted is deserving of the promotion is to form a committee to make the decision. Jorge, Christine, and Kenji are selected by the Dean to be on the committee. The Dean informs Jorge, Christine, and Kenji that the two criteria for this promotion are research and teaching. Ted must have demonstrated excellence in both GROUP BELIEF AGGREGATION 201 in order to get the promotion. And, if Ted has demonstrated excel- lence in both areas, then he is to be promoted. The Dean also informs them that they are to follow the rule of accepting the majority opin- ion when making their decision as a committee, i.e. if two or more of them vote in favor of something, then that is the committee\u2019s position. Just to be clear they will each decide (and vote) on whether Ted has demonstrated excellence in research and teaching, and so whether he should be promoted. As is also pretty common, Jorge, Christine, and Kenji will be voting via secret ballot and the Dean\u2019s assistant will tally the votes to determine the committee\u2019s decision. Here\u2019s how the voting goes. Jorge votes that Ted demonstrated ex- cellence in both research and teaching, so he votes that Ted be pro- moted. Christine votes that Ted demonstrated excellence in research but not in teaching, so she votes that Ted not be promoted.",
