    "paragraph": " Jenny\u2019s environment is hospitable to her forming true beliefs, so the processes that lead to her beliefs are re- liable. Unfortunately, Denny\u2019s belief-forming processes (which are the same as Jenny\u2019s) aren\u2019t reliable in the environment in which Denny is stuck. So, on externalist theories, Jenny\u2019s beliefs are justified and Denny\u2019s aren\u2019t, even though they have the same reasons for holding those beliefs. This doesn\u2019t seem right though. It seems that Jenny and NEW EVIL DEMON PROBLEM 123 Denny are either both justified or both unjustified. Hence, the New Evil Demon Problem appears to pose a serious problem for externalist theories of epistemic justification. RESPONSES Externalists about epistemic justification are inclined to opt for var- ious responses to this problem. One such response is to simply deny that Denny really is justified and claim that we are mistaken when we think so. Given the intuitive pull of the New Evil Demon Problem, it\u2019s unsurprising that this response is not very popular. A more popular externalist response involves claiming that exter- nalism can actually yield the intuitive result that Jenny and Denny are alike when it comes to justification. One way of doing this is to argue that we should judge Denny not by whether their beliefs are reliably produced in their own environment, but rather by whether their beliefs would be reliably produced if Denny were in the actual world (Sosa 1991, Comesa\u00f1a 2002). When we judge in this way, Den- ny\u2019s beliefs are just as reliably produced as Jenny\u2019s are because they are produced by the same belief-forming processes and they are evaluated relative to their reliability in the actual world. Another response that has become popular more recently is to ar- gue that there are different sorts of justification at play when we think about this sort of case (Goldman 1988). In particular, some who take this response argue that while Denny\u2019s beliefs aren\u2019t justified, they are excusable or blameless.",

    "answer": "Externalists may respond by denying that Denny is actually justified, claiming that we are mistaken when we think so. However, this response is not very popular due to the intuitive pull of the problem.",
