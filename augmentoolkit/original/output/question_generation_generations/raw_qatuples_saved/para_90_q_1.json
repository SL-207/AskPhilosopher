    "paragraph": " In addition, we sometimes use such locutions as \"The fact that John is honest is good;, and \"The fact that John is blind is bad,\" which seem even more clearly to mean that what is said to be good or bad is some fact. Locutions such as these are frequently used, and what is said by using them is not at all strange if what we mean to say is that some fact is good or bad. When, however, we replace \"The fact that John is honest is good\" and \"The fact that John is blind is bad\" with \"The true proposition that John is honest is good\" and \"The true proposition that John is blind is bad,\" we seem to be saying that it is some true proposition that is good or bad, and to say that a true proposition is good or bad does seem strange. Such strangeness, however, disappears completely if we use instead such locutions as \"That the proposition that John is honest is true is good\" or \"It is good that the proposition that John is honest is true\". Just as \"The fact that John is honest is good\" seems to say that it is some fact that is good, so \"It is good that the proposition that John is honest is true\" seems to say that it is good that a given proposition is true. Although it does seem strange to say of a true proposition that it is good, it is not_ at all strange to say that it is good (or bad) that a given proposition is true (or false). To say the latter, however, is not to say that the proposition itself is good (or bad). Similarly, to say of some pur\u00ad ported fact that it is good ( or bad) that it is a fact is not to say that the fact itself is good ( or bad). To say, that is, that it is good that it is a fact that John is honest is not to say that the fact that John is honest is good. If the preceding is correct, there are two fundamentally different ways of interpreting sentences such as the following: (1) \"It is good that John is honest.\" (2) \"That John is honest is good.\" (3) \"It is bad that John is blind.",

    "question": "Does the expression \"The true proposition that John is honest is good\" convey the same meaning as \"The fact that John is honest is good\"?",
    "answer": "No, the expression \"The true proposition that John is honest is good\" seems to convey a different meaning, suggesting that it is the true proposition itself that is good, which sounds strange.",
