    "paragraph": " According to coherentists, this assumption gives rise to the regress of reasons, and it is mistaken. Instead of thinking that justifi- cation is linear in this way, coherentists contend that justification is a holistic matter. Thus, rather than being analogous to a building like the foundationalists claim, coherentists insist that the structure of justifi- cation is like a web where beliefs are all connected to each other by various strands. On the coherentist picture, a belief is justified because of its connection to other beliefs in the web of beliefs. So, your belief that the University of Alabama won the most recent College Football Playoff National Championship is justified because it is connected to your other beliefs in such a way that the set of those beliefs is coher- ent. There are various ways that coherentists might spell out what it means for beliefs to be coherent with one another. One of the most promising ways of doing this is in terms of explanatory relations. The general idea is that coherence is a matter of beliefs explaining or being explained by one another. For instance, the truth of \u201cthe University of Alabama won the most recent College Football Playoff National Championship\u201d explains why CNN reported that they did, CNN\u2019s record of reliable information when it comes to things of this sort explains why you trust the report, and so on. Now let\u2019s turn to the second debate. The debate between internal- ists and externalists about the nature of epistemic justification is one of the major developments to come out of discussion of the Gettier Problem in contemporary epistemology. It\u2019s an unfortunate historical accident that there are a number of debates in philosophy that use the terms \u201cinternalism\u201d and \u201cexternalism\u201d; so it is especially important to get clear on exactly what this debate concerns. The internalism/ externalism debate in epistemology concerns the nature of justifica- tion.",

    "question": "What is the main difference between internalists and externalists in the context of epistemic justification?",
    "answer": "The main difference is that internalists and externalists have different views on what constitutes epistemic justification. However, the exact nature of this debate is nuanced, and it's essential to understand what it concerns before diving into the details.",
