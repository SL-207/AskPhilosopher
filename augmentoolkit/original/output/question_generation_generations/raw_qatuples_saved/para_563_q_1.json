    "paragraph": " If, however, we have a duty and thus a right in par\u00ad ticular cases so to act concerning others, they too have a duty and thus a right so to act concerning us. 3. Theodicy Conflicts ( 1) between its being intrinsically good that certain acts are morally good and its being intrinsically bad that they are objectively wrong and (2) between its being intrinsically good that certain acts are objectively right and its being intrinsically bad that they are morally bad are similar to conflicts of another type. These are conflicts between Moral and Non-Moral Value 87 ( 1) its being intrinsically bad that certain states of affairs obtain and (2) its being intrinsically good that certain other states of affairs obtain which, however, can obtain only if states of affairs of the first type obtain or at least are believed to obtain. States of affairs of the first type include the existence of what are sometimes termed natural or non\u00ad moral evils and the occurrence of moral wrongs of various sorts. States of affairs of the second type include the occurrence of acts intended to eliminate, lessen, or prevent the existence of natural evils or to right or prevent the occurrence of moral wrongs. Unless either ( 1) natural evils exist or at least could exist and moral wrongs occur or at least could occur or (2) it is believed that they do or could exist or occur, acts of the sort in question could not occur or at least would be pointless if they did occur. If natural evils could never exist and if moral wrongs could never occur and if no one ever believed that they could exist or occur, acts intended to prevent their existence or occurrence could not occur or would be pointless if they did occur. It would be intrinsically good that natural evils never exist and that moral wrongs never occur. The obtaining, however, of such a state of affairs would be extrinsically bad in at least one respect, since it would be incompatible with the obtaining of another state of affairs, the obtaining of which would be intrinsically good.",

    "question": "What type of conflict can arise when it is intrinsically good that certain acts are morally good, but it is also intrinsically bad that they are objectively wrong?",
    "answer": "This type of conflict can be classified as a Theodicy Conflict, specifically between the intrinsic goodness of certain acts being morally good and the intrinsic badness of them being objectively wrong.",
