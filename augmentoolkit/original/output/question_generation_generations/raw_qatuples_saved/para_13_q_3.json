    "paragraph": " DISCUSSION Balog\u2019s argument could be seen as an instance of the phenomenal concept strategy for rejecting the zombie argument (and related \u00adarguments, such as the knowledge argument). This strategy accepts the conceivability of zombies, but explains it in terms of special \u00adfeatures of phenomenal concepts rather than special features of the \u00adphenomenal properties those concepts pick out (Stoljar 2005). Balog\u2019s argument also has much in common with a related strategy, on which \u00adphenomenal concepts are construed as conditional concepts: they refer to physical states if the world is entirely physical, and to non-physical states if the world is not entirely physical (Hawthorne 2002, Stalnaker 2002, Braddon-Mitchell 2003; but see Alter 2007.). Like the phenomenal concept strategy, the conditional analysis strategy defends physical- ism by appealing to claims about phenomenal concepts. But, unlike the phenomenal concept strategy, the conditional analysis is used to challenge the premise that zombies are conceivable rather than the premise that zombies are possible if conceivable. Zombie-argument proponents, such as David J. Chalmers (2007, 2010), respond to Balog\u2019s argument by rejecting her analogy between zombies and yogis. Chalmers suggests that the yogis\u2019 flurg concept differs significantly from phenomenal concepts (or at least from the sorts of phenomenal concepts that are most relevant to the zombie ar- gument). The yogis\u2019 flurg concept is a kind of demonstrative concept: its content could be roughly expressed as \u201cthis inner state, whatever that turns out to be.\u201d By contrast, phenomenal concepts do not seem to be demonstrative concepts. For example, the pain concept picks out a state with a certain distinctive phenomenal quality. That state might or might not be physical; but, either way, it must have that distinctive phenomenal quality if it is to be the reference of the pain concept.",

    "question": "How does the yogis' flurg concept differ from phenomenal concepts, according to David J. Chalmers?",
    "answer": "The yogis' flurg concept is a demonstrative concept, whereas phenomenal concepts are not. Phenomenal concepts pick out states with distinctive phenomenal qualities, whereas the yogis' flurg concept refers to a specific inner state, regardless of its underlying nature.",
