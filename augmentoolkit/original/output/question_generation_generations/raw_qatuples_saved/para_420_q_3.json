    "paragraph": " Now, we might be tempted to think that both of these versions of the problem of the criterion arise because we are trying to work out philosophical theories. Hence, maybe we\u2019re safe as long as we don\u2019t go in for philosophical theorizing. So, philosophy is doomed from the start, but at least the rest of our intellectual lives are safe. Unfortunately, this take on things underestimates the reach of the problem of the criterion. In its most general form, the problem of the criterion can be understood in terms of these two questions: (A**)\t Which propositions are true? (B**)\t How can we tell which propositions are true? All of the other forms of the problem of the criterion are just par- ticular instances of this general schema. Thus, it shouldn\u2019t surprise us that, as with all the other versions of this problem, it seems that we need to know the answer to (A**) before we can answer (B**), but we need to know the answer to (B**) before we can answer (A**). Again, we might simply assume an answer to (A**) or (B**), and then use that answer to come up with an answer to the other ques- tion. But, as before, assuming either answer seems to be begging the question. So, we seem to be stuck. What makes this especially trou- bling is that in this general form, it applies to any proposition that we might consider. The problem of the criterion appears to have a very broad scope indeed. RESPONSES There are three classic responses to this problem: particularism, methodism, and skepticism (Chisholm 1973). Let\u2019s start with skep- ticism. The skeptic says that since we can\u2019t know the answer to (B**) unless we first know the answer to (A**) and we can\u2019t know the answer to (A**) unless we first know the answer to (B**), we LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 74 can\u2019t know the answer to either question. So, the skeptic claims we can\u2019t even begin the project of trying to figure out which propo- sitions are true.",
