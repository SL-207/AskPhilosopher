    "paragraph": " He picks one of his favorites because it has his favorite quarterback, Brett Favre. Oddly enough, while David is watching this game, he is struck by an imperceptible burst of cosmic radiation. Unfortunately, unlike what happens in the comic books David doesn\u2019t gain any superpowers from this burst of radiation. However, on the bright side David doesn\u2019t suffer any negative con- sequences either, aside from one curious thing. While watching the game from his armchair, David suddenly has all of the same beliefs ISOLATION/INPUT OBJECTION 163 that Brett Favre had while playing the game. David believes that he is over six feet tall (although he\u2019s not), that his name is Brett Favre, that he is currently playing football, that it\u2019s third down, that the linebacker looks like he\u2019s going to blitz, and so on. David has exactly the same beliefs that Favre did while playing the game, and he no longer has any of his own beliefs prior to the burst of radiation striking him. Despite this, David\u2019s sensory organs haven\u2019t been negatively affected in any way. So, David still has perceptual experiences as of watching TV, sitting in his chair, and so on. Clearly, in this situation there is a terrible disconnect between \u00adDavid\u2019s beliefs and his experiences of the world around him. Never- theless, David\u2019s beliefs are coherent. After all, Favre\u2019s beliefs while he was actually playing the football game were coherent, and David has all the same beliefs as Favre. This appears to be a major problem for coherentism. Coherentism claims that coherence among one\u2019s beliefs is necessary and sufficient for those beliefs to be justified. Hence, since, intuitively, Favre\u2019s beliefs were justified while he was playing the football game, they must have been coherent. But if those beliefs were coherent then, they seem to be coherent now when David has them. After all, they are the exact same beliefs! And yet, it seems clear that David isn\u2019t justified in believing the things that Favre believed.",

    "question": "Why is David's situation a problem for the theory of coherentism?",
    "answer": "David's beliefs are coherent because they are the same as Favre's beliefs, which were coherent and likely justified while he was playing the game. However, it seems clear that David isn't justified in believing the things that Favre believed, which creates a problem for coherentism because it claims that coherence among one's beliefs is necessary and sufficient for those beliefs to be justified.",
