    "paragraph": " In their view, life was something that needed to be explained over and above our explanations of various biological functions. As a result, they ended up postulating a new substance, elan vital, to expli- cate life. But the vitalists were wrong that there\u2019s any such thing as elan vital. It was only due to ignorance and misconception that they were led to think otherwise. In fact, science can give us a complete explanation of what distinguishes living from non-living things. Why should things be any different with respect to consciousness? In a taxonomical discussion of possible responses to the hard prob- lem, Chalmers (2003) distinguishes between various types of mate- rialist approaches (see Chapter 4). The philosophers he classifies as type-A materialists typically claim that we will eventually be able to ex- plain all the functions of consciousness and, in doing so, we will come to realize that this is all there is to be explained. The philosophers that he classifies as type-B materialists accept that there is an epistemic gap\u2014that there really is a hard problem of consciousness; but they deny that the epistemic gap entails that there is an ontological gap, such that consciousness is not a physical phenomenon (see Chapter 7). The philosophers that Chalmers classifies as type-C materialists typ- ically claim that the hard problem seems so hard only due to our cur- rent ignorance. Given the state of our current scientific understanding of the world, we cannot see how to solve the problem; but that does not mean that it is, in principle, unsolvable. Churchland\u2019s overall position has elements in common with both type-A and type-C materialism, but her discussion of the hornswog- gle problem seems to fit best within the type-C rubric. That said, Chalmers (2003) argues that type-C materialism is itself an unstable position, and ultimately collapses into one of the other types of ma- terialism that he differentiates.",

    "question": "What is your view on the idea that the functions of consciousness can be explained in full, and that this is all there is to be explained?",
    "answer": "I do not have a firm stance on this issue. However, some philosophers, known as type-A materialists, believe that it is possible to fully explain the functions of consciousness and that this is the ultimate explanation of consciousness.",
