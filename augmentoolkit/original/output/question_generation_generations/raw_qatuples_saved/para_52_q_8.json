    "paragraph": " When someone has grapheme-color synesthesia, the numeral 2 might appear to be red in color or the letter D might appear to be green in color. Though the colors associated with particular letters and numbers vary from one synesthete to another\u2014so the number 2 might appear red to one synesthete and blue to another\u2014they stay constant for a given synesthete over time. If the number 2 appears red to a synesthete, it will always appear red to that synesthete. Among the many other varieties of synesthesia, there is also taste-tactile as- sociation, taste-color association, olfactory-tactile association, and visual-olfactory association. Sometimes cases are classified as forms of 36 PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 218 synesthesia even when the trigger is not sensory in nature, as when days of the week are taken to be colored or months are taken to have locations in space. In this chapter, we will focus on the sensory cases. Although references to the phenomenon of synesthesia can be found as far back as the 17th century, and though it was discussed by Francis Galton in the late 19th century, it did not generate much sustained attention until the 1980s. Estimates vary widely about what percentage of people have synesthesia, from well below 1% of the population to as high as 15%, though one especially well-regarded study reports the prevalence of synesthesia to be 4.4% (Simner et al. 2006; for discussion see Johnson et al. 2013). The condition seems to be more common in females than in males, though some recent stud- ies have demonstrated otherwise (e.g., Simner et al. 2006). Synesthesia seems to run in families and seems to be an inherited condition; but there are also some cases of acquired synesthesia, sometimes due to neurological conditions and sometimes due to the use of hallucino- genic drugs. Moreover, some cultures, such as the Ancient Mayan and other Mesoamerican peoples, seem to have put great emphasis on the cultivation of cross-modal experiences like those associated with synesthesia\u2014an emphasis that is revealed throughout their art, archi- tecture, and other cultural practices (see Houston and Taube 2000).",
