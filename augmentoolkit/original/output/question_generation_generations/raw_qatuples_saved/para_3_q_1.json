    "paragraph": " Someone studying only physics would predict all of the movements of the subatomic activity that underlies the organism\u2019s behavior\u2014its attempt to get out of danger. But they would miss what causes that behavior, and would probably fail to understand that there was behavior\u2014as opposed to mere physical motions\u2014in the first place. The Puzzle of the Special Sciences 79 Although psychology neither talks about anything non-physical nor contravenes the laws of physics, it is an autonomous science all the same. Some (such as Fodor himself, and many of the non-reductive materialists mentioned in the previous chapter) draw a moral for the philosophy of mind: mental states are physical states, but they are not identical to those states (and cannot be reduced to them) because they are governed by distinct laws. DISCUSSION Probably the most influential counterpoint to Fodor\u2019s picture of the special sciences comes from Jaegwon Kim (1992). Kim finds some- thing suspicious about Fodor\u2019s story in \u201cSpecial Sciences.\u201d The story, in Kim\u2019s view, depends on claiming that there is a law in the \u00adspecial sciences but no corresponding law in the physical sciences. Kim \u00adquestions this assumption: Why not take the special-sciences law to be a law in physical science? Staying with the economics analogy, Fodor\u2019s answer might seem obvious: units of currency are not physical kinds like quarks, charge, mass, etc. But that seemingly obvious answer itself raises questions. Granted, any particular instance of currency is realized by something physical (paper, copper, electrons, etc.), but the kind itself is not physical. One might wonder, though, why there can\u2019t be a disjunctive kind: \u201cP1 or P2 or P3 or P4\u201d\u2014where P1 is the physical basis of paper money, P2 of copper money, P3 of digital currency, and so on? Though it\u2019s a disjunctive kind, it involves only physical terms. So, why isn\u2019t it a physical kind that can be included in physical laws?",

    "answer": "Yes, psychology is an autonomous science, meaning that it operates independently of the laws of physics, even though it does not involve any non-physical entities or principles.",
