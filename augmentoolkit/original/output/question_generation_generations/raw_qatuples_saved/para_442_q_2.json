    "paragraph": " The love he bears others, rather than being the result of some\u00ad thing like a precise mathematical calculation, would instead be or at least resemble what is sometimes referred to as Christian love. A second source of the attractiveness of the present view is that, given Attitudes toward the Indifferent 179 that there seem to be more indifferent than good or bad things, the person who likes all the indifferent \u045as well as all the good things of which he has experience or knowledge would probably lead a happier life than the person who likes only good things. If, that is, a person is likely to lead a happier life if more rather than less of the things he likes exist, a person who likes indifferent as well as good things is likelier to lead a happier life than a person who likes only good things. To this one might respond that a person who likes bad as well as good and indif\u00ad ferent things would be even more likely to lead a happier life, given that the number of good, bad, and indifferent things is greater than the number of good and indifferent things. To this the reply is that although such a person might be likely to lead a happier life he would not lead a better life, given that it is bad to like bad things. Being happy and having a happy life . is one thing, being good and having a good life another. Other things being equal, a person is happy and has a happy life ( 1) to the degree to which the things of which he has experience or knowledge are things he likes and are not things he is either indifferent toward or dislikes and (2) the more he likes the things he likes and the less he dislikes the things he dislikes. But a person is good and leads a good life, other things being equal, not only to the degree to which he is happy and has a happy life but also to the degree to which he does not like bad and dislike good things. Although one person, Peter, who likes many bad and dislikes many good things, might be happier and have a happier life than another, Paul, who likes far fewer bad and dislikes far fewer good things, Paul is a better person and has a better life than Peter.",

    "question": "What is the criteria for someone to be considered a better person and to have a better life?",
    "answer": "According to the answerer, someone is a better person and has a better life if they do not like bad things and do not dislike good things. This means that even if someone is happy and has a happy life because they like many bad things, they are not necessarily a better person or have a better life than someone who is happy and has a happy life because they like fewer bad things.",
