    "paragraph": " Thus instead of saying that everything has value, since everything has either positive, negative, or neutral value, I shall say that those things, if any, that have neither pos\u00ad itive nor negative value have no value at all or that they are indifferent in value. If we restrict our use of \"value\" in the way suggested, we may say that \"value\" names a genus or determinable of which the most general species or determinations are positive and negative value. The terms \"positive value\" and \"negative value\" are technical or at least quasi\u00ad technical terms. The meaning of \"positive value\" is more or less the same as that of \"good,\" in a wide sense of \"good\"; and the meaning of \"negative value\" is more or less the same as that of \"bad,\" in a wide sense of \"bad\". We may therefore say that \"value\" names a genus or de\u00ad terminable of which the most general species or determinations are good and bad. This, indeed, might even serve as a definition of \"value,\" taken as an adjective or a noun. It is unlikely in this context to be taken as a verb, since_, as we have seen, to say that some person values some\u00ad thing, x, is to say that he likes x or regards it as good. Taken as a verb, the genus named by \"value\" would be more appropriately named \"valuing\". If so, then it is valuing, not value, that is named by \"valuing\". Valuings might themselves have value and be valued and evaluated by someone. Just as a person can like or regard as good certain things and dislike or regard as bad certain other things, so also one can like or re\u00ad gard as good some valuings and evaluations and dislike or regard as bad certain others. One might, for example, like or regard as good evalua\u00ad tions that are careful, conscientious, and judicious and dislike or regard as bad those that are careless, unconscientious, and injudicious. And one might like or regard as good and thus value valuings of others that agree with one's own and dislike or regard as bad valuings of others that disagree with one's own.",

    "question": "How should the term \"value\" be used, and what distinction is being made between different types of value?",
    "answer": "The term \"value\" should be used to refer only to things that have either positive, negative, or neutral value. Those things that have no positive or negative value are considered to have no value at all, or to be indifferent in value.",
