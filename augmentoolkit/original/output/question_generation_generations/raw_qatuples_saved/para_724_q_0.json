This does not mean that a third party beneficiary, c, of a's duty to act compatibly with b's acquiring something to which b has a right therefore nec\u00ad essarily also has a right a has a duty to respect. Thus if I promise someone, Smith, to feed his dog while Smith is out of town, Smith has a right to my keeping my promise by feeding his dog, and I a duty to do so, but his dog does not therefore necessarily have a right to my keeping my promise to Smith or to being fed by me. 5.

Ross, The Right and the Good, 7. 7: This, however, does not mean that the motive moving a person to act is morally good only if the person believes that the act is right, morally bad only if he believes that the act is wrong. Instead, one person's compassion for another that moves him to act to relieve the suffering of the other would seem Notes to Chapters 5-9 213 to be morally good regardless of whether the agent regards the act he performs as being right or obligatory, and one person's envy of another that moves him to harm in some way the other would .seem to be morally bad regardless of whether the agent regards the act he performs as being wrong. 8.
