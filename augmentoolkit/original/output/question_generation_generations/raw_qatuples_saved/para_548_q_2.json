    "paragraph": " Keeping this\u2014along with the conditions Barry is experiencing in the relaxation room\u2014in mind seems to spell trouble for the idea that our mental states are luminous. When Barry reaches the borderline for feeling hot and feeling comfortable (not hot) the change from one to the other will be so minute that it seems that Barry could easily LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 92 mistake the two. But this means that Barry might falsely believe that he feels hot in a situation that is similar to the situation he is in when he is just barely hot. If so, then it seems that Barry isn\u2019t really in a posi- tion to know that he is hot when he is just barely hot. Once Barry ap- proaches the borderline between being hot and being comfortable, it seems that he won\u2019t be in a position to know whether he is hot or not. This, however, means that whether or not he is hot is not luminous to him. Thus, it appears that our mental states are not really as luminous as we might have thought. Hence, Timothy Williamson contended, when first presenting this sort of argument, the philosophical tradition and our commonsense thinking about luminosity are mistaken. RESPONSES One response to this sort of situation is to concede that Williamson is correct that there are borderline cases where our mental states are not luminous, but insist that in clear cases they still are luminous (Reed 2006). For example, this sort of response accepts that Barry isn\u2019t in a position to know whether he feels hot or not once he is near the borderline between feeling hot and feeling comfortable. However, it holds that when Barry is not near a borderline, his mental states are luminous to him. So, when Barry is more than just barely feeling hot, he is in a position to know that he feels hot. A different response seeks to limit the reach of Williamson\u2019s argu- ment in another way. According to this response, some mental states are \u201cself-presenting,\u201d in the sense that the mental state is identical to the belief that the mental state exists (or perhaps is itself part of the content of the belief that the state exists).",
