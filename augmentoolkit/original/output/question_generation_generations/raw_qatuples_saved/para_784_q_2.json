    "paragraph": " He can imagine it by applying his mind\u2019s eye to its shape, to its five sides and the area that is contained within their boundaries. From these series of reflections, he draws a conclusion about the nature of imagination\u2014namely, that it \u201crequires a peculiar effort of mind which is not required for understanding\u201d (1641/2017, p. 51). It seems natural to take this peculiar effort of mind to involve mental imagery. DISCUSSION Though Descartes\u2019 examples are all visual in nature, a similar point can be made about imaginings in other sensory modalities. Just as Imagining Chiliagons 197 you might call a triangle to mind by seeing it in your mind\u2019s eye, you might call the happy birthday song to mind by hearing it in your mind\u2019s ear. Philosophers working on imagination tend to use the \u00adnotion of mental imagery in an expanded sense so that we can just as easily refer to auditory or gustatory imagery as we can refer to visual imagery. Even prior to Descartes, the view that imagination should be under- stood in terms of mental imagery was prevalent among philosophers, and it remained the dominant view for several centuries thereafter (see Brann 1991). In the early 20th century, however, the rise of be- haviorism led this view to fall out of favor. Though philosophers have long recognized a tight connection between mental states and behav- ior, and though it is common to take behavior to be a manifestation of our inner mental states, behaviorists took the connection to be even tighter. On their view, behavior is not a manifestation of a mental state; rather, all that it is to be in a mental state is to exhibit (or be dis- posed to exhibit) the relevant behavior. To suppose that we have inner mental states is to fall victim to a confusion\u2014a confusion that they of- ten referred to as \u201cDescartes\u2019 myth\u201d or as \u201cthe myth of Cartesianism\u201d; and the acceptance of mental imagery is simply a further perpetuation of this alleged myth.",

    "question": "How did the view that imagination should be understood in terms of mental imagery evolve over time?",
    "answer": "The view that imagination should be understood in terms of mental imagery was prevalent among philosophers, but it fell out of favor with the rise of behaviorism in the early 20th century. Before that, it was a dominant view, and it remained popular for several centuries after Descartes initially proposed it.",
