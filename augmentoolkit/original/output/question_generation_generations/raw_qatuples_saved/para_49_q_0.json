    "paragraph": " After all, as Putnam describes the super-super-spartans, their pain is re- lated to their beliefs, desires, etc. in much the same way as ours is. Even so, important critiques of functionalism and related views could be seen as variations on a Putnamian theme. For example, consider Galen Strawson\u2019s (1994) weather watchers: sentient, intelligent creatures that are rooted in the ground and profoundly interested in the local weather. They have sensations, emotions, thoughts, etc. But their physiology pre- vents them from behaving. Strawson claims such imaginary creatures are possible, and that this possibility refutes neobehaviorism: the view that the nature of almost all, if not all, mental states is constitutively linked to behavior. Mainstream functionalism could be classified as neobe- haviorist since, on mainstream functionalism, behavioral dispositions figure into the very nature of mental states. Strawson\u2019s case would seem to mirror Putnam\u2019s cases, in which some creatures have mental states of the same sort we humans have but lack relevant (or all) behavioral components. Although neobehaviorism, in the form of functionalism, remains a contender view today, Putnam-style cases, such as Strawson\u2019s, are widely considered important problems for the view.
