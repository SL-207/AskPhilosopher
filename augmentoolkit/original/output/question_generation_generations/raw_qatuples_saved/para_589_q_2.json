    "paragraph": " But Henry knows that the lottery is fair and that one ticket is a winner! Thus, it seems that it is reasonable for Henry to believe that all the tickets lost and at the same time reasonable for him to believe that one of the tickets won. However, \u201call the tickets lost and one of the tickets won\u201d is, of course, a contradiction. This is the lottery paradox. It is important to keep in mind that there only appear to be three principles at play in the lottery paradox, what we have called SUF- FICIENCY, CONJUNCTION, and NO CONTRADICTION. Once we assume that one can know (and so rationally believe) that a particular lottery is fair, that it has one winning ticket, and that one knows how many tickets are in the lottery\u2014exceedingly plausible assumptions\u2014it is easy to come up with cases, like this one, that show that we can\u2019t reasonably accept all three principles. But, they are all at least initially very plausible. That is why this lottery problem is con- sidered a paradox. RESPONSES As we have said, the lottery paradox seems to straightforwardly show that the three principles, SUFFICIENCY, CONJUNCTION, and NO CONTRADICTION, are jointly inconsistent. In other words, Lottery Paradox 241 they cannot all be true. The challenge of the paradox lies in determin- ing which principle we should think is false, since they are all plausible principles. Given that the paradox arises from three principles, there are three general ways of responding to it. The first way of responding to the lottery paradox is to deny NO CONTRADICTION. This response involves accepting that it can actually be reasonable in some cases to believe something that you recognize is a contradiction (Priest 1998). This is by far the least popular option when it comes to responding to this sort of para- dox, but it is not without a handful of serious defenders. The key to this sort of response is to delineate why it is reasonable to believe some contradictions but not others as well as explain how it is that a rational belief in a contradiction doesn\u2019t \u201cexplode\u201d by allowing one to then reasonably infer anything else.",
