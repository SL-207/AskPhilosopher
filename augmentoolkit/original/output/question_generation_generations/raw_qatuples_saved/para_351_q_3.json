    "paragraph": " Here are the conditions that it has been proven are impossible to jointly satisfy when there are multiple claims to evaluate and multiple individuals evaluating them: 1) Give each individual member an equal say in the group\u2019s position. 2) The group\u2019s position on any particular claim depends upon the individual members\u2019 positions toward that claim. 3) Any set of individual attitudes that are logically consistent are used in determining the group\u2019s position. 4) Aggregating all of the individual positions yields a group posi- tion on all of the claims that is logically consistent. Given the practical importance of these sorts of group decision pro- cesses (the seminal presentation of this sort of problem was written because of how juries are to deliberate in courts of law, after all), there is definitely pressure to figure out ways to best navigate the tension between individual rationality and group rationality. Since it is impos- sible to jointly satisfy all four of these conditions, various responses involve giving up at least one of these conditions. For instance, some argue that it is too stringent of a requirement that each of a group\u2019s positions be logically consistent (this amounts to giving up on 4) (Briggs et al. 2014). Instead, they propose that we should hold group rationality in these sorts of cases to require something weaker than logical consistency. Roughly, the idea here is that in order to be ra- tional, groups don\u2019t have to have positions that are logically consistent; GROUP BELIEF AGGREGATION 203 instead, they must have positions that are coherent (in a sense where coherence is weaker than logical consistency). At first, this might seem to not be genuine rationality until we reflect on the fact that each of us likely has some beliefs that are inconsistent with one another. Likely, we aren\u2019t conscious of these inconsistent beliefs at the same time, but there is a good chance that somewhere in the vast collection of beliefs that we each have, there are some beliefs that are inconsistent with each other\u2014perhaps we couldn\u2019t even recognize their inconsistency if we were to think about both of them at the same time.",

    "question": "Do individuals have conflicting beliefs, even if they are not aware of them?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is likely that individuals have conflicting beliefs that they are not aware of at the same time. These beliefs may be inconsistent with each other, but individuals may not be able to recognize the inconsistency if they are not thinking about both beliefs at the same time.",
