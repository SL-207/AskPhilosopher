    "paragraph": " Intentional content\u2003 see content. See also intentionality. Intentionalism\u2003 see representationalism. Intentionality\u2003 The property in virtue of which things are about or represent other things. For example, beliefs are considered \u00adintentional states because they have representational content: they represent the world as being a certain way. In other words, they have accuracy conditions\u2014that is, they are more or less accurate depending on how the world is. Your belief that snow is white is accurate to the extent that snow is, in fact, white. Internalism\u2003 The theory that the content of any mental state \u00addepends constitutively only on internal features of a subject rather than on features of their environment. See also externalism. Intrinsic feature\u2003 A feature of a thing itself, rather than a feature it has in virtue of its relation to other things. For example, a \u00adbaseball\u2019s spherical shape is an intrinsic feature of the baseball. By contrast, that the baseball is larger than a table tennis ball is an extrinsic (or relational) feature. Introspection\u2003 The distinctive and direct process by which one can acquire knowledge of one\u2019s own mental life. For example, right now I know by introspection that I\u2019m thinking about an old friend. Though I might come to know that you are also thinking about an old friend (perhaps because you tell me that you are), I cannot have introspective access to your mental life. Glossary 319 Irreducible\u2003 Not reducible. Materialism\u2003 see physicalism. Memory theory of personal identity\u2003 The theory that a person\u2019s identity through time consists in connections of memory. This theory is typically attributed to John Locke. Mental state\u2003 State of the mind. Some examples: beliefs, desire, visual experiences, and pains. Metaphysical necessity\u2003 A proposition is metaphysically neces- sary if it is necessary without qualification. For example, on some views it is metaphysically necessary that everything is identical to itself.",
