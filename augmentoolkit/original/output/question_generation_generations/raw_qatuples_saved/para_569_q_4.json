    "paragraph": " For example, you might be a nihilist about composition (this is a view in metaphysics that some philosophers accept which says that there are no compound objects, i.e. there are only fundamental particles) and accept that perceptual beliefs are not under our control. In such a case, you might reasonably believe \u201cthere\u2019s a book and I believe that it\u2019s false that there\u2019s a book\u201d because your perceptual faculties spontane- ously cause you to believe that there is a book, but you accept a phil- osophical theory on which there is no such thing as books. Similarly, this response holds that for the other sort of Moorean proposition, it is possible for one to believe \u201cthere\u2019s a book, but I don\u2019t believe that there is\u201d. In this case, it may be that you accept eliminative material- ism (this is a view in philosophy of mind which holds that there are no \u00adbeliefs\u2014it claims that \u201cbelief\u201d is simply an outdated folk concept). So, it might be true that there is a book and that you don\u2019t believe that PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 238 there is because you don\u2019t believe that there are beliefs. Of course, the only way that believing Moorean propositions can actually be a prob- lem is if eliminative materialism is false, so the assumption here is that this theory is false, even though one might believe it. Hence, it could be that you in fact believe that \u201cthere\u2019s a book, but I don\u2019t believe that there is\u201d because you accept eliminative materialism, even though the theory is false. In sum, this way of responding to Moore\u2019s Paradox in- sists that there is no paradox because there\u2019s nothing irrational about believing Moorean propositions in at least some cases.
