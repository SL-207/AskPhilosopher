    "paragraph": " On the animalist view, for example, if my brain is transplanted into a different body, I am still the brainless body (assum- ing the body is alive) even if the new body has all my memories, traits, and so on. For some, the animalist view seems to detach personhood from psychology in an implausible way. Some philosophers, therefore, adopt a different kind of physical theory of personal identity, accord- ing to which a person is not identical with a human animal but is nonetheless constituted by it. THE CASE How many things are sitting in your chair right now? The intuitive answer is one. But if we take a psychological view of personal identity, then we can\u2019t give that answer and we\u2019re presented with a puzzle. To see how the puzzle arises, consider the thinking animal argument: 1. Presently sitting in your chair is a human animal. 2. The human animal sitting in your chair is thinking. 3. You are the thinking being sitting in your chair. 4. Therefore, the human animal sitting in the chair is you. All of these premises are compelling\u2014assuming you are sitting in a chair, of course\u2014and they seem to entail the conclusion in a straight- forward manner. Suppose, though, that one was inclined to say \u201cYes, there is a human animal here, but I am also a person. And being a per- son is not the same as being a human animal!\u201d That sounds plausible enough, but it sounds like it results in there being too many thinking things in your chair. There is the human animal thinking and then there is you, the person. Unless the animalist is right and those two things are identical, there are too many thinking things in the chair. The best response, says the animalist, is to accept that human persons such as ourselves are simply human animals. DISCUSSION Many philosophers think this argument for animalism moves a little too quickly. This can be seen by considering a corollary to the think- ing animal argument that generates too many minds for the animalist.",

    "question": "What is the animalist view of personal identity, and what are its implications?",
    "answer": "The animalist view holds that a person is identical with a human animal, and if a person's brain is transplanted into a different body, they are still the same person, even if the new body is brainless. This view implies that personhood is not separate from the human animal, but rather is a part of it.",
