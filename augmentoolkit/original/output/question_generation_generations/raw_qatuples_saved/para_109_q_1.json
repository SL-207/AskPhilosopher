    "paragraph": " An attempt to deceive oneself about some utterly trivial matter would be far less serious and require far less in the way of justification than an attempt to deceive others about some matter of the utmost importance to them. If so, then an attempt to deceive oneself is not always intrinsically worse than an attempt to deceive others. A third reason that might be given in support of the view that attempts at self-deception are always worse than attempts to deceive others is somewhat more subtle than the first two. It goes as follows. Each of us has a duty to endeavor to develop a character which is such that we can bear to face any truth that confronts us, regardless of how unpleasant we might find it. Each of us has such a duty because of the intrinsic goodness of understanding oneself, others, and the world, and we are more likely to acquire such understanding if we develop such a character than if we resort to self-deception in an effort to escape var\u00ad ious truths we find distasteful. Each of us also has a duty to do what we can to assist others to develop such a character, especially those, such as 1 36 The Nature of Value our children, with whom we have some influence. Since, however, there are some people who have not in fact developed such a character, and whose lives would be shattered were they to lose or to come to doubt certain beliefs they hold, we have a duty not to do or to say anything that would lead them to lose or to come to doubt these beliefs. We may therefore resort to deception, and indeed might even have a duty so to do, if such deception is necessary to avoid the unhappy consequences that very likely would follow upon their losing or coming to doubt the beliefs in question. Since, however, each \u0418f us has a duty to develop the kind of character in question, and since self-deception is incompatible with the development of such a character, none of us can ever rightly resort to such deception.",

    "question": "What is the importance of developing a character that allows you to face any truth, no matter how unpleasant?",
    "answer": "Developing such a character is important because it allows for a deeper understanding of oneself, others, and the world, which is considered an intrinsic good. This character is also necessary for acquiring true knowledge and wisdom.",
