    "paragraph": " I want now to suggest that it is because some such likings are manifestations of such a disposition that they are intrin\u00ad sically good. This, however, can be the case only if manifestations of Attitudes toward the Indifferent 1 93 such a disposition are intrinsically good. If they are, and they do clearly seem to be, then those likings of indifferent things that are manifesta\u00ad tions of such a disposition are themselves also intrinsically good. Indeed, given that magnanimity consists, at least in part, in liking var\u00ad ious indifferent things, a person has this virtue, other things being equal, only if and only to the extent to which he does in fact like various such things. If the preceding is correct, then, again other things equal, the person who likes few, if any, and is indifferent toward most, if not all, of the indifferent things of which he has experience or knowledge is not as magnanimous as the person who likes many such things. And since magnanimity is a virtue or good-making property of a person, an indif\u00ad ferent person, again other things equal, is not as good a person as a magnanimous person. Indeed, a person, if such were possible, who is indifferent toward all the indifferent things of which he has experience or knowledge, including even all those things to which he stands in some special relation, would not in that respect be a very good person at all. From this, however, it does not follow that anyone can reason\u00ad ably be expected. to like all the indifferent things of which he has expe\u00ad rience or knowledge. Although such a person, for reasons given above, might be more likely to lead a good and happy life than one who does not, such supererogatory liking, if it may be called such, is too much to ask, much less to require, of anyone. The most we can reasonably expect of people is that they have sufficient magnanimity to like various of the indifferent things of which they have experience of knowledge, especially those to which they stand in some special relation.",
