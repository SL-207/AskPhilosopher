    "paragraph": " A helpful way to do this is to first start with deductive inferences by way of a contrast. Deductive inferences are such that if they are valid, the truth of the premises entails the truth of the conclusion. Hence, if you make a valid deductive inference starting from true premises, there is no way that your conclusion can be false. Inductive infer- ences are different. Even if they are very good inferences and they start with all true premises, it is still possible for the conclusion to be false. Broadly speaking, inductive inferences are where we infer things about unobserved cases from things we have observed. An example will help (the abstract form is in parentheses): \u2022\t Ravens have been observed in a variety of situations. (F\u2019s have been observed in a variety of situations.) \u2022\t All the observed ravens have been black. (All observed F\u2019s are G\u2019s.) \u2022\t Therefore, the next raven will be black. (Therefore, the next F will be a G.) In this case, we are drawing an inductive inference about the next raven based on the ravens that have been previously observed. It is also common to draw general conclusions from observed cases: Puzzles and Paradoxes 208 \u2022\t Ravens have been observed in a variety of situations. (F\u2019s have been observed in a variety of situations.) \u2022\t All the observed ravens have been black. (All observed F\u2019s are G\u2019s.) \u2022\t Therefore, all ravens are black. (Therefore, all F\u2019s are G\u2019s.) Although neither of these inferences are such that their conclusions must be true, it is clear that they are good ways to reason. And it is clear that as long as one has good reason to accept the premises of the inferences, one has good reason to accept the conclusions as well. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: GRUE/NEW RIDDLE OF INDUCTION Let\u2019s consider a case of what appears to be a good inductive inference. There have been many emeralds observed in a wide variety of situ- ations. All of the observed emeralds have been green.",
