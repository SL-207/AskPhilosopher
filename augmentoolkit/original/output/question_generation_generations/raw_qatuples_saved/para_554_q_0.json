    "paragraph": " When Perry believes he is spilling the sugar, he self-ascribes the property of spilling sugar. When Perry believes that the sky is blue, he self-ascribes the property of being such that the sky is blue (or, to put it another way, he self-ascribes the property of being in a world where the sky is blue). Finally, there are descriptivist theories (Howell 2006, 2023). On these theories, when we have I-thoughts we are thinking of ourselves indirectly, as bearers of certain properties. On one view, for example, in I-thoughts we think of ourselves as the subjects of the conscious states of which we are directly aware. This view thus takes a page from the acquaintance view, which allows that we have direct access to certain subjective things, but, instead of being self-acquainted, we are acquainted with our conscious states (see Chapter 46).
