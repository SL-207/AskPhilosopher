    "paragraph": " But again, the naturalistic \u00adexplanation in question relies on teleological theories of mental content, and the Swampman example threatens to undermine those theories. Representationalists who accept teleological/co-variational accounts of representation would appear to be committed to denying that Swampman has phenomenal consciousness. In other words, their view seems to entail that Swampman does not feel anything\u2014that there is nothing it\u2019s like for him to see green, for example. That might Swampman 149 seem even more counterintuitive than the idea that Swampman has no beliefs. DISCUSSION The Swampman example first appeared in Donald Davison\u2019s 1987 article \u201cKnowing One\u2019s Own Mind.\u201d But Swampman-like challenges to teleological theories had previously been discussed in the literature (Boorse 1976, Millikan 1984). Such challenges stem from the fact that, intuitively, having mental states with representational content seems compatible with the absence of the historical factors that teleological theories emphasize in their explanation of such content. Some respond to the challenge by rejecting the historical/etiologi- cal component of such theories while retaining the teleological com- ponent (Schroeder 2004, Nanay 2014, Bauer 2017, Piccinini 2020). In other words, they explain representational content in functional terms, but give up on the attempt to explain a thing\u2019s function in terms of historical factors such as historical co-variation. For example, Bence Nanay proposes that, roughly put, a certain trait has a certain function F if and only if F would contribute to the relevant organism\u2019s fitness\u2014whether or not F has served this function in the past (but see Artiga 2014, Garson 2019; and for other theories of representational content in which such historical factors do not play a central role, see Pautz 2021 and Siewert 1998). Others respond to the challenge by rejecting the intuitive judgment that Swampman has mental states with content.",

    "question": "What is the intuition that underlies the challenge posed by the Swampman example?",
    "answer": "The intuition is that having mental states with representational content seems compatible with the absence of the historical factors that teleological theories emphasize in their explanation of such content. In other words, it seems that a being can have mental states with content without having a historical connection to the world.",
