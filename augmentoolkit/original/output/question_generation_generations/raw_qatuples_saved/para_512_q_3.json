    "paragraph": " Derek Ball (2009) calls this fellow \u201cArthritis-man.\u201d Now imagine a counterfactual situation in which Arthritis-man is the same as he actually is in all individualistic respects, just like Amari and AmariTE. But, in the counterfactual situation, physicians, lexicographers, and informed non-experts apply the term \u201carthritis\u201d CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 156 not only to arthritis but also to various other ailments, some of which can \u00adoccur in thighs. According to Burge, Arthritis-man and his \u00adcounterpart have different mental contents. Arthritis-man\u2019s actual contents (the propositions he believes) contain the concept of arthri- tis. Yet, in the\u00a0counterfactual situation, his contents contain a distinct concept\u2014the concept of \u201ctharthritis.\u201d Internalism is again refuted. But this time, the relevant environmental features are social. In both the actual and counterfactual situations, Arthritis-man would describe what he means by \u201carthritis\u201d in the same way (at least prior to when his doctor informs him that arthritis cannot occur in the thigh\u2014something that would not happen in the counterfactual situation). Nevertheless, the concepts involved in the two situations are distinct. Initially, this might sound odd. How could one be mis- taken about one\u2019s own concepts? But, on reflection, it isn\u2019t so odd. One can possess a concept incompletely, that is, without fully un- derstanding what it does and does not apply to\u2014a position many of us are in with respect to concepts like \u201cfruit\u201d and \u201cvegetable\u201d (which category should tomato go in?). Indeed, having incomplete mastery of our own concepts is quite common. Burge (2007) describes the idea that one might possess a concept without completely understanding it as the pivot on which his arthritis thought experiment turns. And if his analysis of that or the Twin Earth thought experiment is correct, then the content of one\u2019s mental states cannot be cleanly separated from specific features of one\u2019s environment in the way that internal- ism entails.",
