Although the intrinsic value of a compound state of affairs, x, con\u00ad taining two or more states of affairs as its parts, is determined, at least in part, by the intrinsic value of its parts, a consideration of the relation of x to other states of affairs that are not parts of x can be relevant only to determining the extrinsic value of x.

    "answer": "The concepts of extrinsic goodness and badness are relative concepts, which means that they are determined by a state of affairs' relationship to other states of affairs.",
