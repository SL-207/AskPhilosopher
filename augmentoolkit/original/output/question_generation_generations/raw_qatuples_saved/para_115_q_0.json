    "paragraph": " Such a position manifests a certain compassion for others that is missing in the view that we can never rightly deceive others, even in those situations in which our not doing so has profoundly unhappy consequences for those we decline to deceive. It seems, however, to be less compassionate than the position that each person may also resort to self-deception if doing so is necessary to prevent deeply unhappy con\u00ad sequences for himself. It might well be true that each of us does indeed have a duty to develop in himself the kind of character mentioned above and also to do what he can to assist others in the development of such a character. But just as others, despite our having such a duty, might still be unable to face certain truths, so also I might equally be unable to face certain truths. Just as the lives of others might be shattered if they were to lose or to come to doubt certain of their beliefs, so also might mine were I to lose or to come to doubt certain of my beliefs. If so, and if I can rightly resort to deception to prevent the shattering of the lives of others, then why cannot I also rightly resort to self-deception to prevent the shattering of my own life? If in such cases I can rightly resort to deception, and indeed have a duty to do so, for the sake of others, then why cannot I resort to self-deception, and even have a duty to do so, for my own sake? The answer would seem to be that if I can rightly do, and indeed have a duty to do, the former, then I can also rightly do, and even have a duty to do, the latter. Just as I can rightly deceive others from compassion for them, so also I can rightly deceive myself from concern for my own happiness. The position advocated here is compatible with the view that each of us has a duty to develop in himself, and to assist others in developing in themselves, the kind of character mentioned above. It is compatible The Primacy of Practical Rationality 137 also with the view that the possessiqn of such a character is a good\u00ad making property or virtue of a person, and thus with the view that, other things equal, a person is a better person if he has this virtue than he would be if he did not have it.",
