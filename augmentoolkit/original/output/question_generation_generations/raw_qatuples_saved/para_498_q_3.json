    "paragraph": " But do you find anything that is you? Do you find the thing having these conscious states? Both the Buddha and Hume think not. There is nothing found but conscious expe- riences. The thing that has them\u2014the self, or the subject of those experiences\u2014eludes introspection. This point about elusiveness is primarily epistemological or expe- riential. It concerns what we can introspect or experience. But Hume and the Buddha both also draw metaphysical conclusions. The Bud- dhists adopt the doctrine of no-self. Though there is a conventional sense in which there is a self or person\u2014so words like \u201cI\u201d or names like \u201cAnanda\u201d aren\u2019t meaningless\u2014the deeper metaphysical truth is that there is no such thing (see Chapter 40). Hume seems to take a different path, adopting the view that the self just is the bundle of experiences. There is some chance that the difference in these views is merely verbal. Hume\u2019s bundle could just be the conventional referent of \u201cI\u201d; but since it is not an unchanging thing, persisting unaltered throughout a person\u2019s existence, it wouldn\u2019t count as a real (non- conventional) self for the Buddhists. DISCUSSION The claim that the self is elusive can be glossed as the claim that we do not have inner perception of the self. To determine whether this is true, and indeed to understand the view itself, we need to be clear about what is involved in this sort of perception. According to one view, to perceive an object is to perceive the properties of that object. When we perceive a desk, we perceive it by perceiving its shape and its color. If this view is true, then there is a clear sense in which we do in fact perceive the self. Thoughts and conscious states are properties of the self. They are not free-range experiences; they belong to the subject of experience and are modifications of it. Our awareness of these properties, then, just is perception of the self, in the same way that our awareness of the desk\u2019s shape and color just is perception of the desk.",

    "question": "What is the view that Hume seems to adopt regarding the nature of the self?",
    "answer": "Hume seems to adopt the view that the self is simply a bundle of experiences. This suggests that the self is not a single, unchanging entity, but rather a collection of experiences that are not determinate or constant.",
