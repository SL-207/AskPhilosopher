    "paragraph": " Love not only makes us blind to defects easily detectable by an impartial eye but also makes us see things utterly invisible to such an eye. Loving as we do those we love most, we can easily come to believe that they have various of the virtues that would make them worthy of our love and that they do not have various of the vices that would make them unworthy of it. What has just been said applies also, with the necessary changes, to Persons, Things, and Value 109 those who hate us most. Those who hate us most, hating us as they do, are provided by their hatred for us with a motive for regarding us as bad that others who do not hate us do not have. It is hard, although not impossible, to hate a person we regard as good. We want those we hate to be bad even though we believe them to be good and are thereby pro\u00ad vided a motive for ascribing to them various of the vices the possession of which would make them bad and for not ascribing to them various of the virtues the possession of which would make them good. Wanting those we hate to be bad, we are inclined to believe that they are indeed bad. Being so inclined, we find it easy to explain away or even to fail to see in those we hate various virtues that those who do not hate them as we do detect with an impartial eye. We also find it easy to see in those we hate various vices that remain invisible to an impartial eye. Hate not only makes us blind to virtues easily detectable by an impartial eye but also makes us see things invisible to such an eye. Hating as we do those we hate most, we can easily come to believe that they have various vices that would make our hatred of them justified and that they do not have various virtues that would mak\u0455 it unjustified. In the respects indicated, loving and hating are reverse images of one another. There \u00b7 is a kind of reverse phenomenological parallelism between the two. This, however, does not mean that the phenomena are equal in value.",
