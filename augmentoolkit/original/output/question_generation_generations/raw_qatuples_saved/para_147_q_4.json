    "paragraph": " There are various ways that supporters of credit views of knowledge spell out the \u201cdeserving credit\u201d condition. Rather than attempt a survey of them, it will be helpful to just consider one prominent version in order to get a good handle on what these views of knowledge are saying in general. According to some virtue reliabilists (these are theorists who claim that knowledge requires intellectual virtue but include a commitment to reliabilism in their account of intellectual virtues; for more on reliabilism see General Background: The Nature of Justification pp. 113\u2013119), in order for S to deserve credit for the true belief that p, it has to be the case that be- lieving the truth about p is intellectually valuable, S believes the truth about p, and S\u2019s believing this manifests S\u2019s reliable cognitive functioning. Credit theories of knowledge seem to be able to handle many Gettier cases because in various Gettier-style examples the subject believes truly, but it seems that their believing the truth isn\u2019t really creditable to them. Instead, in a Gettier case, credit theorists claim, it is a matter of luck that the person believes truly, and so their true belief shouldn\u2019t be credited to them. NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 26 EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: CREDIT VIEW OF KNOWLEDGE Bob has recently arrived in New York City, which he is visiting for the very first time. He has just walked out of Grand Central Station onto 42nd Street. It\u2019s a beautiful day, so he thinks to himself that it\u2019d be great to have a good look at the city. He\u2019s always wanted to see the Empire State Building, and he remembers that it has an observatory too, so he decides that\u2019s where he\u2019ll go. He reaches into his pocket to look up di- rections on his phone and realizes it\u2019s not there. Oh no! Bob suddenly remembers that he left his phone on the table at home before he went to the train station! Having no better options Bob looks around and walks up to the closest adult nearby and asks her for directions to the Empire State Building.",
