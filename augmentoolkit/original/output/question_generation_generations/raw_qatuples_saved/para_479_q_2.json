    "paragraph": " Though the question of sharing conscious states and minds is plenty interesting in itself, it also has bearing on a problem that is often raised for panpsychism. According to panpsychism, at least a substantial amount of fundamental\u2014or, if not fundamental, very \u00adbasic\u2014\u00adfeatures of the universe are mental. Panpsychists do not usually hold that quarks are popping around with fully developed conscious fields like yours. But they do hold that things like quarks nonetheless have some conscious properties. Far from appearing only when there are creatures with particularly sophisticated brains, consciousness is pervasive, appearing even at the microphysical level. Odd as this view might sound, it has recently received an increas- ing amount of attention and shouldn\u2019t be dismissed simply because it sounds weird. Almost any story about consciousness will probably involve some weirdness (Goff et al. 2022). The motivation for the view is that there must be some consciousness on the microphys- ical level to explain how consciousness exists at the macrophysical level. The view does face a challenge, however, concerning how these \u00adlittle conscious states add up to compose conscious minds like ours. Suppose with the panpsychist there are conscious states at the most Sharing Feelings, Combining Minds 283 fundamental microphysical level. Conscious states there are presum- ably like conscious states anywhere\u2014they have to be had by some- thing. So, wherever there is a conscious state, there is a subject of that state. This means that, for the panpsychist, the world is filled with micro-\u00adsubjects. But how do these micro-subjects combine in such a way to produce macro-subjects such as ourselves (Goff 2006)? Re- call James\u2019 example\u2014putting a group of subjects together does not create a new subject, but only a collection of subjects. If this is the case, panpsychism cannot explain part of what it meant to explain: the existence of conscious experience in subjects like ourselves.",
