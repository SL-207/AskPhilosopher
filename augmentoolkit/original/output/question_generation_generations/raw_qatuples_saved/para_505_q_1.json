    "paragraph": " (As Burge notes, that last difference can be set aside since he could as easily have made the case about aluminum and twin-\u00ad aluminum, mackerel, and twin-mackerel, etc.; and with those exam- ples Amari and AmariTE would be fully physically indistinguishable.) In short, they are indistinguishable from the skin in, insofar as those features are described non-intentionally\u2014that is, without reference to what their mental states represent. What should we say about the mental states of Amari and AmariTE? Suppose Amari and AmariTE have a belief that they might verbally express by saying: \u201cI believe that water is refreshing.\u201d Amari\u2019s belief is about water, whereas AmariTE\u2019s belief is about twin-water. But do their beliefs have the same propositional content, just applied to differ- ent substances? Do they involve the same concepts? According to in- ternalism, the answer is yes, for there is no relevant difference between individualistic features of Amari and her counterpart. According to Burge, the correct answer is no. Amari and AmariTE believe distinct propositions, which contain distinct concepts. The \u00adproposition Am- ari believes contains the concept of water, whereas the proposition AmariTE believes contains the concept of twin-water. Thus, Burge concludes, internalism is false. The difference in mental content between Amari and AmariTE would seem to derive from differences in their physical environments. But Burge (1979) argues that mental content can constitutively de- pend on features of one\u2019s social environment as well. To show this, he considers a series of cases, one of which involves arthritis, a disease that can only occur in joints. Imagine someone who has a wide range of unsurprising attitudes about arthritis, such as the belief that the arthritis in his wrists and fingers is more painful than the arthritis in his ankles. But he also thinks that he has developed arthritis in his thigh\u2014something his doctor might tell him is not possible since the thigh is not a joint.",
