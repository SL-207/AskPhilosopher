    "paragraph": " If so, then whereas in the first example the duty of rendering aid overrides the duty to keep my promise, in the second the duty to keep my promise overrides the duty of rendering aid. If the preceding examples, and many others that could also be adduced, show what I think they do, then there can be no hierarchy of specific duties descending from the most stringent to the least stringent in such a way that any given duty is either more stringent or less strin\u00ad gent than any other in every conceivable situation. Instead, in one situ\u00ad ation duty a might override duty b, so that we act rightly in that situa\u00ad tion only by doing a, and in another situation duty b might override duty a, so that we act rightly in this situation only by doing b. It is also conceivable that there be situations such that in them we have a duty to do something, a, and also a duty to do something, b, that a and b 132 The Nature of Value cannot both be done, and that neither takes precedence over the other. Most of us tend, I believe, to regard such dilemmatic situations as uncomfortable. If we do, part of the reason we do is perhaps that we like to have decisive reasons for doing a rather than b, or for doing b rather than a, and in such situations there are no such decisive reasons, so that the choice we make, whether it be to do a or to do b, seems arbi\u00ad trary. Part of the reason might sometimes also be that we want some\u00ad thing to guide and justify our choice, and in such situations there is nothing that counts decisively from a moral point of view in favor of doing a or in favor of doing b. It is sometimes uncomfortable to be in a situation in which we must do either a or b, cannot do both, and have no better reason for doing a rather than b or b rather than a. If only we had some decisive reason for doing one rather than the other we should be freed from the need to choose between the two. At the same time, however, there is also a comfortable side to such situations, which is that we act rightly whether we do a or do b and are therefore morally free to do either and even to choose the alternative we are more inclined to choose independently of any need to attempt to justify on moral grounds the choice we make.",

    "question": "What can be uncomfortable about having to choose between two duties that cannot both be done?",
    "answer": "It can be uncomfortable because it means that the choice between the two duties seems arbitrary, and there is no decisive moral reason for choosing one over the other. This can make it difficult to justify the choice that is made.",
