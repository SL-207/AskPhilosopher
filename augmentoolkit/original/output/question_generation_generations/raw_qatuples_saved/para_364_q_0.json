    "paragraph": " The difficulties confronting the other positions issue from the fact that they all accept either an egoistic view of practical rationality and a non-egoistic view of morality or an egoistic view of morality and a non-egoistic view of such rationality. Unmitigated non-egoism escapes Morality and Rationality 1 69 these difficulties precisely because it \u00b7holds a non-egoistic view of both practical rationality and morality. It recognizes that there is no an\u00ad tecedent impartial concept of practical rationality that is neither ego\u00ad istic nor non-egoistic, that the relatively empty concept of practical ra\u00ad tionality can be given adequate content only by adopting an egoistic or a non-egoistic view of morality, and that an egoistic morality is unac\u00ad ceptable. This means that the concept of practical rationality can be given adequate content only by adopting a non-egoistic view of morality, so that the only acceptable concept of practical rationality must also be non-egoistic. I have given the position for which I have argued the ugly negative name \"unmitigated non-egoism\" rather than \"unmitigated altruism\" for the following reason. The latter name might suggest that each person acts rightly only if he acts compatibly with the promotion of the interests of others affected by his action, regardless of how his own interests are affected. Such a view, however, would ignore the fact that the agent who acts 3:s well as those affected by his actions is a person and that the promotion of his interests as well as those of others has value. Because of this each person may rightly have as much concern for the promotion of his own interests as for the pro\u00ad motion of those of others. Just as each of us ought not to treat others as things to be used and manipulated solely for the sake of the pro\u00ad motion of one's own interests, so also no one ought to regard himself as a thing to be used by himself solely for the sake of the promotion of the interests of others.",
