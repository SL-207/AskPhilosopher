    "paragraph": " If that which remains upon the completion of step ( 1) is greater than that Species of Value 3 7 which remains upon the completion of step (2), then x has greater total value than y; if it is less than that which remains upon the completion of step (2), then y has greater total value than x; if it is the same as that which remains upon the completion of step (2), then the total value of x is the same as that of y. It might happen that although the difference between the intrinsic positive value of x and y is greater than that between the intrinsic posi\u00ad tive value of a and b, the proportion of the value of b to a is greater than that of the value of x to y. For the sake of convenience, let us make the admittedly unrealistic assumptions ( 1) that the degree of the positive intrinsic value of a state of affairs can be measured in terms of positive units of value and (2) that the degree of the negative intrinsic value of a state of affairs can be measured in terms of negative units of value. Let us suppose also that the degree of positive value of x is 100 units, of y 50 units, of a 10 units, and of b 40 units. If so, then x is twice as valu\u00ad able as y, b four times as valuable as a. This, however, does not mean that the conjunction of y and b is intrinsically better than that of x and a. Instead, since the positive intrinsic value of the conjunction of x and a is 110 units, whereas that of the conjunction of y and b is only 90 units, the conjunction of x and a is intrinsically better than that of y and b. If so, the total value of x is greater than that of y. It might be helpful to consider another example. Suppose ( 1 ) that x has positive intrinsic value but negative extrinsic value, (2) that y has negative intrinsic value but positive extrinsic value, (3) that a, the state of affairs from the obtaining of which x derives its extrinsic value, has negative intrinsic value, and ( 4) that b, the state of affairs from the obtaining of which y derives its extrinsic value, has positive intrinsic value.",

    "question": "What are the conditions for a conjunction of states of affairs to be intrinsically better?",
    "answer": "A conjunction of states of affairs is intrinsically better when the positive intrinsic value of the conjunction is greater than the positive intrinsic value of another conjunction. This can occur even if the individual states of affairs in the conjunctions have different degrees of value.",
