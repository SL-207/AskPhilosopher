    "paragraph": " Philosophical behaviorism\u2019s popularity was also waning. Nevertheless, Putnam anticipated potential behaviorist \u00adresponses to his argument. One response was that the claim that \u00adsuper-super-spartans feel pain is unverifiable, and therefore meaning- less. That response assumes a verificationist theory of meaning, on which a statement is meaningful only to the extent that it can be em- pirically verified or empirically falsified. Like behaviorism, that theory had fallen out of favor by 1963. (If verificationism sounds plausible, then consider that the verificationist principle is itself unverifiable!) But Putnam argued that it would be possible to empirically verify that the super-super-spartans feel pain, for example, by detecting relevant brain activity. In fact, the main behaviorist response was to not to defend their theory, at least not as a general theory of mind (with exceptions; see, for example, Gibbs 1969). Some proposed that behaviorism applies to cognitive states, such as belief and desire, but not to sensations such as pain (Smart 1959); and some rejected even that weakened variety of the theory. Even so, many embraced successor theories, including functionalism (see Chapters 15, 16, and 18). These philosophers often attributed the implausibility of behaviorism to its narrow focus on the external causes (stimuli) and external effects (behavioral responses) of mental states. A better theory, they thought, would include a place for inner states and relationships among such inner states. Mental states should be understood as states that play certain functional roles, where The Super-Spartans 85 the components of functional roles include not only external stimuli and behavioral responses but also relations among mental states (Lewis 1966, Putnam 1967, Armstrong 1968). Although the possibility of super-super-spartan pain is incompati- ble with behaviorism, functionalism might be able to accommodate it.",
