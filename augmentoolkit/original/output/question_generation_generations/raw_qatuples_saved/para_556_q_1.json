    "paragraph": " Until now, we\u2019ve been discussing Moore\u2019s Paradox in terms of what\u2019s wrong with what George says; however, the paradox also ap- plies to beliefs. In particular, it seems that the absurdity doesn\u2019t go away if George believes these things but keeps his mouth shut about them. In other words, it seems just as absurd to believe \u201cit\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s raining, but I believe that it\u2019s not raining\u201d as it is to assert these claims to others. We will limit our focus to the belief version of this paradox because that is more clearly central to epistemology. That said, let\u2019s make sure that we are crystal clear on the general nature of Moore\u2019s Paradox. It seems that it is absurd to believe \u201cp and I don\u2019t believe that p\u201d or to believe \u201cp and I believe that p is false\u201d. Nevertheless, neither of these Moorean sentences express ob- vious contradictions. In fact, it seems that they could both be true. So the challenge of Moore\u2019s Paradox is to explain why it is that believing such Moorean propositions is unreasonable. RESPONSES One response to Moore\u2019s Paradox contends that at least for one kind of Moorean proposition, it is impossible for you to believe its content. This response relies upon the idea that anytime you believe that p, you also believe that you believe that p (Hintikka 1962). Hence, this response insists that \u201cp and I don\u2019t believe that p\u201d cannot be rationally believed because it will land the believer in a contradiction. Here\u2019s how. According to this response, if you believe \u201cp and I don\u2019t believe that p\u201d, that means that you believe p and you believe that \u201cI don\u2019t believe that p\u201d. But since you believe that p, you must also believe that you believe that p. Thus, according to this response, what\u2019s absurd about believing a Moorean proposition is that in doing so, you would have to believe that you believe that p and (at the same time) believe that you don\u2019t believe that p, which is a contradiction.",

    "question": "What is the nature of a Moorean proposition, and what are some examples of such propositions?",
    "answer": "A Moorean proposition is a sentence of the form \"p and I don't believe that p\" or \"p and I believe that p is false\". These sentences are not obvious contradictions, but they are still considered absurd to believe.",
