    "paragraph": " Given that we act rightly by doing either a or b, we are morally free to choose whichever alternative we believe would please us most or displease us least. The preceding position is realistic in that it recognizes that there are genuine conflicts between competing values and duties that cannot be resolved by an appeal to abstract universal principles that would enable us in any conceivable situation that might arise, regardless of its com\u00ad plexity, to determine definitively that one value or duty takes prece\u00ad dence over another. Despite the animadversions and easy cavils of var\u00ad ious of their critics, some of whom seem not to have taken the trouble to read them with care, it is \"intuitionists\" such as Prichard, Ross, and Carritt who, among twentieth-century moral philosophers, seem most clearly and fully to have recognized and appreciated the complexities of moral and value questions that require an acceptance of the kind of realistic position presented above. Such a realistic position does not deny that certain duties are gener\u00ad ally weightier than others or that certain sorts of things generally have greater value than other sorts of things, nor does it deny that we can some.times know which duties are generally weightier than others and which sorts of things generally have greater value than other sorts of The Primacy of Practical Rationality 133 things. Nor does it deny that such kn9wledge is frequently helpful, and sometimes indispensable, in endeavoring in concrete existential situa\u00ad tions to divine which of two or mo_re conflicting duties overrides the others in such situations or which of two or more competing values in such situations takes precedence over the others when it is impossible that they all be realized. It does, however, deny that such abstract and general knowledge is always sufficient, in any conceivable concrete sit\u00ad uation in which we might find ourselves, to enable us to determine, in the situation in which we find ourselves, which of the conflicting duties applicable to us in that situation overrides the others in that situation and which of the competing values realizable by us in that situation takes precedence over the others in that situation.",
