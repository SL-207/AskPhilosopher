    "paragraph": " In that case, even if you know I\u2019m drinking water, you could conceive of my glass containing no hydrogen\u2014and you could do so without making any mistake in reasoning. There\u2019s nothing about the concept of water that prevents you from conceiving of hydrogen-free water. For you, such a thing is conceptually possible. But for all that, it might be metaphysically impossi- ble. Likewise, one might reason, perhaps a zombie world is impossible despite being conceivable. However, the analogy between conceiving of zombies and conceiv- ing of hydrogen-free water has been questioned. Hydrogen-free water is ideally conceivable only if we fail to consider some of the world\u2019s physical features, including water\u2019s chemical composition. By contrast, the zombie-world scenario duplicates all of the actual world\u2019s physical features. So, without saying more, physicalists can\u2019t explain the ideal conceivability of a zombie world in the way they can explain the ideal conceivability of hydrogen-free water. But these philosophers have a lot more to say. Recall the phenomenal concept strategy from Chap- ter 4. Phenomenal concept strategists attribute the ideal conceivability CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 42 of zombie world not to distinctive features of consciousness itself but rather to distinctive features of how we think about consciousness\u2014 that is, to phenomenal concepts (Loar 1997, Balog 1999, Hill and McLaughlin 1999, Papineau 2002). Maybe it\u2019s just built into phe- nomenal concepts that consciousness is independent of physical and functional features. If so, we should blame the ideal conceivability of a zombie world not on the nature of phenomenal consciousness but instead on the nature of phenomenal concepts. If the phenomenal concept strategy succeeds, then we can have our cake and eat it too: we can accept the intuition that a zombie world is ideally conceivable, but deny that this ideal conceivability entails that such a world is metaphysically possible.",

    "question": "Can a zombie world be metaphysically possible if it is ideally conceivable, according to the phenomenal concept strategy?",
    "answer": "If the phenomenal concept strategy succeeds, then we can accept the intuition that a zombie world is ideally conceivable without it entailing that such a world is metaphysically possible. This seems to be a way to \"have our cake and eat it too\" - accepting the conceivability of a zombie world without accepting its metaphysical possibility.",
