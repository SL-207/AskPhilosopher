    "paragraph": " Recall S\u2019s belief that p is safe just in case in the closest worlds to this one (\u201cclosest worlds to this one\u201d are ways that our universe could be different that are very similar to how the universe actually is) where S believes that p, p is true. This is thought to not be satisfied in the fake barn cases because there are very close worlds in which Martha believes that she sees a barn, but she\u2019s wrong. There are so many barn fa\u00e7ades around her that she could easily have looked at one of them and still believed that what she sees is a barn (Sosa 1999, 2007). When it comes to sensitivity, S\u2019s belief that p is sensitive just in case if p were false, S wouldn\u2019t believe that p. Again, it seems that Martha\u2019s belief fails to meet this requirement. Presumably, if it were false that what she sees is a barn, it would be because Martha is looking at one of the many barn fa\u00e7ades. But if she were looking at a barn fa\u00e7ade, Martha would believe that she is seeing a barn (Nozick 1981). Hence, requiring that modal conditions, such as safety or sensitivity, be satisfied in order to have knowledge seems to yield the correct result in fake barn cases.
