    "paragraph": " As indicated above, to say that the true proposition that John is honest is good is another way of saying that the fact that John is honest is good. The only reason advanced for saying that some true propositions are good and some bad is that true propositions are facts, in the third sense of \"fact,\" and that some facts are good and others bad. Since, however, false propositions are not facts in any of the three senses of \"fact\" distinguished above, the reason given for saying that some true propositions are good and some bad cannot be given for saying that so also are some false propositions. Even if there were some reason for claiming that some false proposi\u00ad tions are good and some bad, it still is not clear what could be meant by such a claim. One thing that might be meant is the following. For any given propo\u00ad sition there is a contradictory proposition opposite in truth-value to the given proposition. Similarly, if a given true proposition is good its con\u00ad tradictory is bad, and if a given true proposition is bad its contradictory is good. On such a view, just as the contradictory of any given proposi\u00ad tion is opposite in truth-value to the given proposition, so also the con\u00ad tradictory of any given proposition is bad if the given proposition is 26 The Nature of Value good and good if the latter is bad. In the way indicated, the view in question would assimilate the goodness or badness of propositions to their truth or falsity. This, however, would not mean that every true proposition is good and every false proposition bad. Instead, just as some true propositions are good and others bad, so also some false propositions are good and others bad. Let us examine this view. As was indicated above, the only reason given for saying that some true propositions are good and others bad is that true propositions are identical with facts, some of which are good and some of which are bad.",

    "question": "According to the view being discussed, what is the relationship between the goodness or badness of a proposition and its truth or falsity?",
    "answer": "The view suggests that the goodness or badness of a proposition is assimilated to its truth or falsity, but this does not mean that every true proposition is good and every false proposition is bad. Instead, some true propositions are good and others are bad, and some false propositions are good and others are bad.",
