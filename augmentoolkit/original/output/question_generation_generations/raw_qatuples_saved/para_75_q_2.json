    "paragraph": " But that is a minority view. Type-A materialists more typically accept the existence of con- sciousness, but argue that it is a mistake to think that any problem regarding its existence or its nature will remain after the so-called easy problems have been solved. For example, Patricia Churchland (1996) argues that, insofar as we cannot imagine how that would work, this is attributable to our own limitations\u2014and that we have good reason to expect that further scientific progress will overcome The Hard Problem of Consciousness 23 them. (We will return to Churchland\u2019s response to the hard problem in Chapter 10.) In a similar vein, Daniel Dennett (1996) concludes that if we re- move all functional features of our experience, there is nothing left to explain. He reaches that conclusion by taking a \u201cthird-person perspec- tive\u201d on his own experiences\u2014viewing himself objectively, from the outside, so to speak (he refers to this method as heterophenomenology). Indeed, his conclusion might seem inevitable unless one considers consciousness subjectively, from the inside\u2014that is, from the first-\u00ad person perspective. One might regard taking information acquired from the first-person perspective as unscientific. But, if we are trying to understand consciousness, that attitude strikes many philosophers as overly restrictive. Type-B materialists agree that the hard problem does not reduce to a bunch of easy problems. But they deny that this indicates that the universe itself must contain some extra non-physical ingredient. These philosophers often attribute the hard problem to how we think about conscious experience, rather than to conscious experience \u00aditself. In other words, they blame the hard problem on our concepts of \u00adconsciousness. This approach is known as \u201cthe phenomenal concept strategy\u201d (Stoljar 2005, Balog 2012). Though popular, the phenomenal concept strategy faces \u00adserious challenges.",
