    "paragraph": " If you translate them into the imper- sonal, though, they do: if I am saying \u201cThere is a headache\u201d and you are saying \u201cThere is not a headache,\u201d then one of us must be wrong. Impersonal reports are thus not equivalent to first-personal reports. Since it can certainly be the case that I have a headache and you don\u2019t, the selfless reports must leave something out. And it is evident what is missing from the selfless reports: who has the headache. Putting the point in terms of language and impersonal versus per- sonal thoughts might seem to invite a Buddhist response: though Chisholm\u2019s point shows that first-personal sentences are not equiv- alent in meaning to impersonal sentences, it doesn\u2019t follow that PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 288 sentences or thoughts using \u201cI\u201d refer to a real self. They might just refer to the conventional self of the sort the Buddhists can accept. This might be a little quick, however. The point can be put in meta- physical terms instead. You can have a headache when I don\u2019t because there is a certain natural unity to each of our conscious states. The itch in my back and the pain in my knee occur together\u2014in the same mental space, as it were\u2014and they don\u2019t occur in the same mental space with your headache. My mental states are mine, and yours are yours. This doesn\u2019t appear to be a merely conventional matter. If someone adopted a convention to refer to \u201cTorambert\u201d as that self that \u00adcombined the conscious states of the three authors of this book, that convention wouldn\u2019t change the metaphysical facts\u2014Torin\u2019s headache is not \u00adunified with Amy\u2019s imaginings or the music playing in Robert\u2019s head. According to some philosophers, the self is just that which explains this unity of consciousness (Peacocke 2014, Howell 2023; see also \u00adChapters 44 and 45). Whether or not this argument from the unity of consciousness is convincing as an argument for the self, it seems clear that it is too quick to conclude from the elusiveness of the self to introspection that there is no self.",

    "question": "What is the relationship between the self and the unity of consciousness, according to some philosophers?",
    "answer": "According to some philosophers, the self is the entity that explains the unity of consciousness. In other words, the self is what holds together your various conscious states, such as your headache, your itch, and your knee pain, into a single, unified mental space.",
