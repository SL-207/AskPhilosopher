    "paragraph": " But, the debasing demon can ruin things for you. It can make it so that your current experience of reading this page, say, is in fact what is causing you to believe that epistemology is the most impor- tant area of philosophy. And, at the same time, the demon can make it so that the argument that you previously read is having no influence at all on your believing what you do. In such a situation, you are believ- ing the right thing but for the wrong reasons. You have been debased. Another way the demon might debase you is by making it so that you don\u2019t hold your belief on the basis of any reason whatsoever, perhaps because it directly makes you have the belief. So, rather than making it so that some other mental state of yours causes you to believe that epistemology is the most important area of philosophy, the debasing demon causes you to have this belief by directly affecting your brain in an undetectable way. Again, you are debased! Now, you might be thinking \u201cthis is ridiculous, there\u2019s no debas- ing demon!\u201d Well, you\u2019re probably right. But, remember that often LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 78 in epistemology in order for a thought experiment to be effective it doesn\u2019t have to be very likely\u2014it just has to be possible. Is it possible (in the broadest sense of the term) that a debasing demon could ex- ist? It seems so. Is it possible (in the broadest sense of the term) that right now you are the unwitting victim of a debasing demon? Again, it seems so. Well, since this seems possible, we might wonder whether any of our beliefs are actually justified. How do we know that we aren\u2019t debased? The possibility of the debasing demon casts doubt on whether any of our beliefs are justified. And, if our beliefs aren\u2019t justi- fied, they don\u2019t qualify as knowledge. Hence, the debasing demon may threaten every bit of our (presumed) knowledge. RESPONSES There are two basic sorts of responses to the skeptical threat posed by the debasing demon.",

    "answer": "Yes, I believe that it is possible (in the broadest sense of the term) that a debasing demon could exist. Even though the idea of a debasing demon may seem ridiculous, it is conceivable that such an entity could exist.",
