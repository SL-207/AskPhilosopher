    "paragraph": " EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: EPISTEMIC JUSTIFICATION: EXTERNALISM VS. INTERNALISM; FORGOTTEN EVIDENCE We\u2019re going to consider two people: Belle and Bill. Let\u2019s start with Belle. Belle is a very careful person. She only trusts sources of information JUSTIFICATION 130 that she knows to be reliable, she doesn\u2019t believe things simply because she wants them to be true, and so on. That said, she is just like all of us. She\u2019s not infallible; sometimes she makes mistakes and sometimes she forgets things. Several months ago, Belle researched the health benefits of eating avocados. As per usual, Belle only consulted reliable sources of information when she learned that avocados have good fats, dietary fiber, and several vitamins. So, when Belle formed her belief that avocados are a healthy food to eat, she did so on the basis of good evidence. As a result, Belle formed a justified belief that avocados are a healthy food to eat. Now, several months later, Belle still believes that avocados are a healthy food to eat. However, she doesn\u2019t remember how she came to form this belief. That is to say, Belle has forgotten all of her evidence for this belief, but she still believes that avocados are a healthy food to eat. Bill tends to be less careful about what he believes. At least some- times Bill believes things without sufficiently good evidence. Several months ago, Bill formed the belief that avocados are a healthy food to eat. His evidence for this? The fact that he thinks avocados taste good. That\u2019s it. Bill didn\u2019t do any research into the health benefits of avocados, he didn\u2019t ask anyone who might know about this, etc. Bill simply formed the belief that avocados are healthy because he likes them. Clearly, Bill\u2019s belief that avocados are healthy wasn\u2019t justified. Now, however, many months later Bill has forgotten all about how he came to have the belief that avocados are healthy. Nevertheless, Bill still believes that avocados are a healthy food to eat.",

    "question": "Does Bill's lack of justification for his belief about avocados change the fact that he still believes it?",
    "answer": "No, Bill's lack of justification for his belief about avocados does not change the fact that he still believes it, but it does affect the status of that belief as justified.",
