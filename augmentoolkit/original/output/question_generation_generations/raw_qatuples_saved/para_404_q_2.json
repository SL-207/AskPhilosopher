The problem of the cri- terion threatens our knowledge by questioning whether we can have good reasons/evidence at all. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: EPISTEMOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY; SKEPTICISM Descartes asks us to consider trying to sort good apples from bad ap- ples. A very important task\u2014because as we all know, one bad apple can ruin the bunch! Of course, this is easy. You can sort good and bad ap- ples, no problem. But imagine that you are completely unfamiliar with apples and that no one is around to tell you how to go about sorting them. You have a basket full of apples in front of you, and you are going to sort several more baskets full. How could you possibly sort the good apples from the bad? If you knew the answer to one of these questions, you\u2019d be set: (a) which of the apples in this basket are good apples? (b)\u00a0How can you tell which apples are good? If you knew the answer to (a), you could use that answer to come up with an answer to (b), and so proceed to sort the remaining apples. Or, if you knew the answer to LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 72 (b), you could use that to answer (a). Unfortunately, you don\u2019t know the answer to either question. Even worse, it seems that before you can know the answer to (a) you have to already know the answer to (b), and before you can know the answer to (b) you have to already know the answer to (a). It appears that you are going to have a very tough time sorting these apples! This is essentially the problem of the criterion. One prominent way of understanding the problem of the cri- terion is just the apple sorting problem applied to epistemological theorizing. It arises when we consider these two questions about knowledge: (A) What do we know?",

    "question": "Why is the apple sorting problem a useful analogy for understanding the problem of the criterion?",
    "answer": "The apple sorting problem is a useful analogy because it illustrates the difficulty of determining how to evaluate or \"sort\" knowledge claims. Just as it is difficult to determine how to sort good apples from bad apples without already knowing the answer to either question, it is difficult to determine how to evaluate knowledge claims without already having some knowledge or criteria for evaluation.",
