    "paragraph": " There is only one difference: you have conscious experi- ences, and they do not. They could be described as \u201cseeing\u201d words right now, in the sense that their brains register information. But there is nothing it\u2019s like for them to see those words. There\u2019s nothing it\u2019s like for them, period\u2014ever. They are a zombie: a physical/functional duplicate of a human being who lacks consciousness entirely. Not that anyone could tell. If your zombie twin were asked what they are seeing, they will answer exactly as you would. And they will insist that they are not a zombie, just as you would. But while you are right, they are wrong. Your zombie twin probably does not exist. But their existence does not seem impossible. Indeed, it seems possible for there to be an entire zombie world: a world that lacks consciousness but is identical to the actual world in all physical and functional respects. And that possi- bility is hard to reconcile with physicalism. By definition, a zombie world has every physical and functional feature that the actual world has. If such a world is possible, then how could consciousness be just a physical phenomenon? In the actual world, consciousness exists. So, if consciousness were physical, then duplicating the actual world\u2019s physical and functional features should guarantee the \u00adexistence of consciousness. For comparison, consider rocks. Could there be a world that dupli- cates the actual world in all physical and functional respects but that does not contain rocks\u2014a rock-zombie world? This seems doubt- ful, precisely because rocks are physical phenomena. There is nothing more to a rock than what would be captured in a complete physical and functional description of it. But while a rock-zombie world seems impossible, a consciousness-zombie world seems possible\u2014contrary to what physicalism seems to imply. The zombie argument has three main premises, which can be stated roughly as follows: 1.",

    "question": "Can a zombie twin understand and respond to questions in the same way as a human being?",
    "answer": "Yes, a zombie twin can be fooled into thinking that it has conscious experiences and can respond to questions in the same way as a human being. However, it truly lacks consciousness.",
