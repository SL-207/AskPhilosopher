Analysis 64: 348\u2013353. 48 LOTTERY PARADOX Background: Here are three principles that seem very plausible. First, what we might call \u201cSUFFICIENCY\u201d. SUFFICIENCY says that it is rational to accept/believe that p, if the probability that p is sufficiently high (even if the probability isn\u2019t 1, i.e. even if it isn\u2019t absolutely certain that p is true). Many people accept this because it seems that if we require certainty (probability 1) before it is rational to believe something, we will be saddled with wide- spread skepticism. After all, very few things that we believe are absolutely certain for us. Second, there\u2019s what we might call \u00ad\u201cCONJUNCTION\u201d. CONJUNCTION says that if it is rational to believe p and rational to believe q, then it is rational to believe p and q.",

    "question": "How does the concept of SUFFICIENCY relate to the idea that very few things that we believe are absolutely certain for us?",
    "answer": "SUFFICIENCY suggests that it is sufficient to have a high probability of a proposition being true in order to believe it, rather than requiring absolute certainty. This is consistent with the idea that very few things that we believe are absolutely certain for us, and that a more nuanced view of rational belief is more reasonable.",
