    "paragraph": " Learning that something like where you were born affects what you believe may give you a good reason to doubt that your beliefs are sufficiently responsive to evidence to count as justified or known. In other words, when a person\u2019s belief that p is challenged on the grounds that they only believe that p because of some influ- ences that aren\u2019t sufficiently connected to the truth, it seems that this challenge gives the person reason to doubt that the evidence they have for p is good enough to warrant believing it. RESPONSES One way of understanding the challenge posed by \u201cyou only believe that because\u2026\u201d is as giving one reasons to think that one\u2019s belief(s) isn\u2019t formed in a way that is sensitive or safe. Recall saying that S\u2019s belief that p is sensitive amounts to claiming that if p were false, S wouldn\u2019t believe that p. When it comes to safety, S\u2019s belief that p is safe just in case in the closest worlds to this one where S believes that p, p is true. So, this challenge might be understood as giving one reasons to think that one would have the same belief even if that belief were false (i.e. that the belief isn\u2019t sensitive to the truth). Another way to un- derstand the challenge is as alleging that one\u2019s belief isn\u2019t safe because there are nearby worlds (perhaps even this world!) where S believes p but p is false. Given these understandings of the challenge, it is possible to respond by arguing that sensitivity and safety aren\u2019t necessary for knowledge or justification (Bogardus 2013). If these modal condi- tions aren\u2019t really required for knowledge, then pointing out that one\u2019s LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 88 belief fails to meet either of these conditions doesn\u2019t really threaten one\u2019s justification for that belief or threaten whether such a belief can count as knowledge. A different approach to this general challenge is to embrace what is known as \u201cpermissivism\u201d (Schoenfield 2014).",
