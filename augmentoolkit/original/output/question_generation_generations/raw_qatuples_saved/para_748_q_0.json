    "paragraph": " To make the point even clearer, this person is an exact mental duplicate of Jenny. But, unlike Jenny, who is a normal adult in a normal situation, this person is the victim in some sort of skeptical scenario. Perhaps they are being deceived by Descartes\u2019 Demon (see Descartes\u2019 Demon pp. 55\u201360) or they are a brain in a vat, or they are in the Matrix. Let\u2019s call this mental duplicate of Jenny in this situation \u201cDenny\u201d. Denny has all of the same beliefs, as Jenny, thinks the same way that Jenny does, has the same experiences as Jenny, has the same memories, and so on. As we said, Denny is exactly like Jenny mentally, but in a skeptical scenario rather than in the real world. An interesting question arises when we think about this possibil- ity: what should we say about Denny\u2019s beliefs? Denny has all of the same beliefs as Jenny and they hold these beliefs for the same reasons that Jenny holds her beliefs, but many of Denny\u2019s beliefs are false. For example, Jenny and Denny both think that they are reading this book, but while Jenny really is reading it, Denny is being tricked into thinking this. Denny doesn\u2019t even have a book. Denny may not even have eyes to see the book or ears to hear the words of the book if someone were to read it to them. So, Denny\u2019s beliefs are false, whereas Jenny\u2019s are true. But what about justification? Jenny and Denny believe all the same things for the same reasons. It seems that if Jenny is reasonable in believing as she does, so is Denny. After all, Jenny doesn\u2019t have any special information that Denny lacks. Denny thinks that they are reading about a crazy possibility where someone exactly like Jenny is in a skeptical scenario, and they are having the same thoughts and JUSTIFICATION 122 questions as Jenny when they think about this possibility. Given that Jenny should believe that she is reading this book, shouldn\u2019t Denny believe the same thing?",
