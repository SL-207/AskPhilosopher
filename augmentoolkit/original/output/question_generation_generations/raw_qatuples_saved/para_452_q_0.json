DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-51 SHARING FEELINGS, COMBINING MINDS BACKGROUND When we empathize with someone, we might say \u201cI feel your pain.\u201d But that\u2019s a figure of speech. We can\u2019t actually feel someone else\u2019s particular pain, can we? Thoughts and conscious states are private, in the sense that only subjects who have them can be aware of them in a certain way. Suppose you get a pain in your finger whenever your twin cuts himself dicing carrots. Do you feel his pain? Not really. Instead, it seems you are having pain when he has pain, perhaps mys- teriously caused by his feeling pain or by his finger being cut. It\u2019s not literally his pain. Although his thoughts and feelings are of the same type as yours, his are his and yours are yours. As it is sometimes put, his thought tokens are different from your thought tokens. His pain could stop and yours doesn\u2019t, or vice versa. But is this how we have to think of things? Is there anything incoherent in the idea that two subjects or selves have to be in one and the same token conscious state? The privacy of the mental is closely tied to what might be called the independence of minds, the idea that two minds cannot combine to form another mind. No matter how closely you and your twin work together and \u201cshare\u201d thoughts, there are still two minds there, each 45 PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 280 with their separate (even if exactly similar) streams of consciousness. Moreover, it is difficult to understand how two distinct minds can also combine to form a further mind. This idea was motivated by the case proposed by Williams James (1890) that we consider in this chapter.",
