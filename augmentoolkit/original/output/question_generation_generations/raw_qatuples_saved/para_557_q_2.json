    "paragraph": " If, however, he does what is in fact objectively right even though he believes that the act he performs is wrong, his act is objectively right but morally bad. It is intrinsically good that his act is 86 The Nature of Value objectively right but intrinsically bad that it is morally bad. In such sit\u00ad uations the obtaining of one state of affairs, the obtaining of which is intrinsically good, is possible only at the cost of the obtaining of another, the obtaining of which is intrinsically bad. So long as he con\u00ad tinues to hold his mistaken beliefs and acts on them, certain of his acts will be morally good but objectively wrong; if, however, he fails to act on them certain of his acts will be objectively right but morally bad. In either case he will bring about something intrinsically good but also something intrinsically bad. Given the possibility of such conflicts, ir is our absolute duty to reflect as carefully and conscientiously as we can about what our objective duties in fact are and to seek advice from the wisest people to whom we have access, given the amount of time we have for such reflection and for seeking such advice before choice and action are inescapable, and, having done so, to act accordingly. Doing so gives us the best chance we have of avoiding such conflicts at least to some extent, given that it is unlikely that we can unfailingly avoid them in all the complex situations in which from time to time we might find ourselves. We have also a duty to give others, when requested, the advice we have a duty to seek. Should our advice be rejected or should it not be sought, it might become our duty to do what we can to dissuade and even by force to prevent others from acting in ways we believe to be objectively wrong even though in doing so we might be compelled to require of them that they act in ways they believe to be wrong. Whether in particular cases we act rightly in an objective sense in doing so depends upon whether the total positive value of their acting rightly but in ways they believe to be wrong is greater than that of their acting wrongly but in ways they believe to be right.",
