    "paragraph": " Perhaps the major flaw in the argument outlined above against the possibility of self-deception is the assumption that a necessary condi\u00ad tion of anyone's attempting to deceive anyone, either himself or others, is that he know that or be conscious that he is attempting to do so. Such an assumption has things backwards. The truth of the matter is that a necessary condition of one's knowing that or being conscious that he is endeavoring to deceive someone, whether himself or others, is that he in fact be attempt.ing to do so. Just as a necessary condition of one's knowing that a given proposition is true is that it be true, so also a nec\u00ad essary condition of my knowing that I am attempting to deceive someone is that in fact I be doing so. If I am not attempting to do so, then I cannot know that I am attempting to do so. And just as a given proposition can be true regardless of whether I believe or know that it is, so also I can endeavor to deceive someone, whether myself or others, regardless of whether I believe or know that I am endeavoring to do so. What holds here for attempts to deceive holds generally for other endeavors, acts, and mental states. In general, a necessary but not a suf\u00ad ficient condition of my knowing that I am doing or attempting to do something or that I am in a certain mental state is that I am in fact doing or attempting to do the thing in question or that I am in fact in the mental state in question. If so, then although I cannot know that I am endeavoring to deceive someone, either myself or others, unless in fact I am attempting to do so, I can endeavor to deceive myself or others without knowing that I am attempting to do so. A second major flaw in the argument outlined above against the pos\u00ad sibility of self-deception is the assumption that to endeavor to deceive someone, whether myself or others, is to attempt to lead him to believe either ( 1) that some proposition I believe to be true is false or (2) that 140 The Nature of Value some proposition I believe to be false is true.",
