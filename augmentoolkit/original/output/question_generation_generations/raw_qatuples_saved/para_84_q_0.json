    "paragraph": " Such a reason cannot be given for saying that some false propositions are good and others bad. Nor does the fact that every true proposition has a contradictory opposite that is false mean that the latter must be bad if the former is good or good if the former is bad. From the fact that the true proposition that John is honest is good it does not follow that the false proposition that it is false that John is honest is bad. Instead, what follows is that it would be bad if it were false that John is honest. If so, then although some true propositions might be good and others bad, it does not follow that their contradictory opposites might also be either good or bad. Instead, if a given true proposition is good ( or bad) its contradictory would be bad ( or good) if it were true. This is another way of saying that it would be bad if a given good proposition were false rather than true and that it would be good if a given bad proposi\u00ad tion were false rather than true. It is not at all strange to say (1) that it would be bad if John, who is in fact honest, were instead dishonest or (2) that it would be good if John, who is in fact blind, were instead sighted. It is, that is, not in the least strange to say of propositions we believe to be false that it would be good (or bad) if they were true. It is, however, strange to say of any proposition we believe to be false either that it is good or that it is bad. What led us to the view that some false propositions are good and others bad was the view that some true propositions are good and others bad. The latter view, as was indicated earlier, is itself strange, although perhaps not as strange as the former view. What led us to the latter view was the view that true propositions are facts, in the third sense of \"fact,\" coupled with the view that some facts are good and others bad. And what led us to this view is the fact that we sometimes say such things as \"It is good that John is honest,\" \"That John is honest is good,\" \"It is bad that John is blind,\" \"That John is blind is bad,\" cou\u00ad pled with the view that what is said by using such locutions is that some Ontological Categories and Bearers of Value 2 7 fact is good or bad.",
