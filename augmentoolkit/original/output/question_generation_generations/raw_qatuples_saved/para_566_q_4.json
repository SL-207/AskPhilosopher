    "paragraph": " Remember, Otto is not merely a casual user of his notebook. He uses it consistently and relies on it completely. Insofar as we\u2019re inclined to accept that what makes something a belief is the causal-explanatory role that it plays in a cog- nitive system, it would be arbitrary to treat the case of Otto differently from the case of Inga. If something external to one\u2019s head, such as an inscription in a notebook, plays an appropriate causal-explanatory role, then, in Clark and Chalmers\u2019 view, it should qualify as a belief despite its location. It seems to follow that even before he consults his notebook, Otto believed that MoMA is on 53rd Street. DISCUSSION When Clark and Chalmers first published their theory, in 1998, smart devices were not yet in mass circulation. The first BlackBerry phones came out in 2002 and the iPhone followed in 2007. Our slavish reli- ance on these devices probably makes the case for the extended mind more compelling than it seemed two decades ago. When your sibling asks, \u201cDo you know Mom\u2019s work number?\u201d you might very well an- swer \u201cyes\u201d and pull out your phone to look it up in your contacts. In the 2020s, most of us no longer store our beliefs about phone \u00adnumbers in our biological memory; rather, we store them in the non-biological memory of our phones. Just as Otto\u2019s mind extends out into the world to his notebook, our minds often seem to extend out into the world to our phones. But at this point, a question arises. In light of the fact that we regu- larly carry our phones with us and use our phones the way that Otto CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 164 uses his notebook, does that mean that any information contained on someone\u2019s phone counts as one of their beliefs? At any given time, someone could easily Google the population of Fresno or the recipe for figgy pudding. Does that mean that they count as having beliefs about these facts?",

    "answer": "The issue is whether any information contained on someone's phone, such as facts looked up with a search engine, counts as one of their beliefs.",
