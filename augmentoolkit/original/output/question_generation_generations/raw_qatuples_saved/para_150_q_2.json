    "paragraph": " Although he might believe that the reasons in question are good reasons, he is still deceived by the other person if he does not see that the reasons given him are good reasons. Since attempts at the kind of deception in question do in fact occur, attempting to deceive does not always consist of endeavoring to lead someone, whether oneself or others, to believe either ( 1) that some proposition one believes to be true is false or (2) that some proposition one. believes to be false is true. It might, however, be objected that the argument presented, if it establishes anything at all, establishes on]y that attempts to deceive others do not always consist in endeavoring to lead them to accept as true some proposition one believes to be false or The Primacy of Practical Rationality 141 to reject as false some proposition one _believes to be true. Since I cannot endeavor to deceive myself into accepting some proposition I believe to be true or into rejecting some proposition I believe to be false, endeav\u00ad oring to deceive myself does consist in attempting to lead myself to believe either ( 1 ) that some proposition I believe to be true is false or (2) that some proposition I believe to be false is true. This brings us to the second reason for rejecting the view that to endeavor to deceive someone, whether oneself or others, is to attempt to lead him to believe ( 1 ) that some proposition one believes to be true is false or (2) that some proposition one believes to be false is true. The second reason for rejecting this view is based on the fact that a person can attempt to deceive someone, either himself or others, into believing that some proposition he neither believes to be true nor believes to be false is ( 1) true or (2) false. Such attempts at deception are perhaps most likely to occur when I neither believe that a given proposition, p, is true nor believe that it is false, yet want either myself or others to believe either that p is true or that p is false.",
