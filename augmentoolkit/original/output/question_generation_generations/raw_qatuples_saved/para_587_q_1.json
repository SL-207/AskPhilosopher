    "paragraph": " But establishing his conclusion requires more than the observation that it is hard to imagine the Queen herself not originating from g. Perhaps we are simply unimaginative. And, even if were impossible for us to imagine the Queen not originating from g, it would not immediately follow that such a thing could not have happened (Gendler and Hawthorne 2002). Kripke connects his discussion of the Queen with another example, and others have followed him in doing so. He considers a wooden table t and asks whether it could have been made from a completely differ- ent block of wood b\u2014or even from \u201cwater cleverly hardened into ice\u201d (1972/1980, p. 113). His answer is no, and his reasoning parallels what he says about the Queen and the gametes. For example, he notes that, although we can imagine a table not made from b that has many of t\u2019s properties, that does not show that t itself could have failed to have been made from b. Taking this one step further, Kripke uses both the Queen example and the table example in support of a general principle that we might call the essentiality of origins principle: \u201cIf a material object has its origin from a certain hunk of matter, it could not have had its origin in any other matter\u201d (1972/1980, p. 114, fn. 56). As Kripke remarks, the general principle just stated probably requires qualification\u2014e.g., concerning the vagueness of the notion of a \u201chunk of matter.\u201d Also, whether the Queen (or any person) is a material object is controversial (see Chapters 1, 39, 41, and 42). But the Queen, the table, and the latter principle are usually discussed in tandem. Several different arguments for the essentiality of origins principle have been developed. Colin McGinn (1976), Nathan Salmon (1981), Graham Forbes (1985), and others develop arguments based on The Queen and the Gametes 299 sufficiency principles\u2014principles detailing conditions for being a par- ticular object (t or the Queen, say) in any possible world.",
