    "paragraph": " After all, Denny has the same reasons for thinking this that Jenny does. On what grounds would it make sense to say that Jenny should believe that she\u2019s reading this book but Denny shouldn\u2019t? It can\u2019t simply be because Denny is wrong and Jenny\u2019s not. Otherwise, that would mean that we can never have justified false beliefs, but surely sometimes we can reasonably believe something despite being mistaken. That seems to be exactly what is going on with Denny. Thus, it seems that Jenny and Denny are both justified in believing the same things even though only one of them has true beliefs. This possible situation is known as the New Evil Demon Problem. It is \u201cnew\u201d because it\u2019s not quite the same as Descartes\u2019 original demon problem (see Descartes\u2019 Demon pp. 55\u201360). In fact, unlike Descartes\u2019 Demon, the New Evil Demon Problem isn\u2019t even used to argue for skepticism. But then, why is it a problem and why is it important? The answers to these questions go hand in hand. The New Evil Demon Problem is important because it is thought to teach us a valuable lesson about the nature of justification: we can have justified beliefs regardless of the external environment in which we find ourselves. It\u2019s considered a problem because this valuable lesson seems to be at odds with ex- ternalist theories of justification. Recall, such theories claim that what one is justified in believing is not simply a matter of the experiences, memories, and so on that one has. Instead, externalist theories of jus- tification claim that epistemic justification is the result of beliefs being produced in the right way. Consequently, such theories seem commit- ted to claiming that Denny\u2019s beliefs are all unjustified while Jenny\u2019s are justified, despite the fact that they have the same beliefs because of the same apparent memories, experiences, and so on. Why is this? Well, the environments that Jenny and Denny are in are very different, although they don\u2019t realize this.",

    "question": "What is the New Evil Demon Problem, and what is its significance?",
    "answer": "The New Evil Demon Problem is a thought experiment that illustrates a possible situation where two people, Jenny and Denny, have the same beliefs despite being in different environments. This problem is significant because it seems to teach us a valuable lesson about the nature of justification: that we can have justified beliefs regardless of the external environment in which we find ourselves.",
