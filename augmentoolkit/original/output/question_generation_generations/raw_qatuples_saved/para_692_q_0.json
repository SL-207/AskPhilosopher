For example, one can know that water is H2O only a posteriori. See also a priori knowledge. A priori knowledge\u2003 Knowledge that does not depend, for its \u00adjustification, on sense experience. For example, one might know a priori that 5 + 7 = 12. See also a posteriori knowledge. Animalism\u2003 The theory of personal identity that says that a person is fundamentally a physical organism (a human animal), and thus that a person\u2019s continued survival through time consists in facts about the survival of the human animal. Anti-individualism\u2003 see externalism. Behaviorism\u2003 Behaviorism is the theory that explains the mental in terms of behavior or behavioral dispositions. For example, the mental state of belief is explained in terms of behavior such as assenting to a proposition; the belief that snow is white might be explained in terms of such dispositions as being disposed to say \u201cYes\u201d when asked \u201cIs snow white?",
