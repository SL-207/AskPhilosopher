    "paragraph": " In support of claim 2, that a split-brain subject like Twain is a single person, we might first point to the fact that this is how they seem to think of themself. They don\u2019t describe themself as having more than one mind, or like a part of themself is hidden to themself. We might also point to the behavioral integration that they exhibit in ordinary day-to-day life. Split-brain patients are able to tie their shoes, to play the piano, and to swim\u2014activities that require coordination between both sides of the body. Disunity arises only in artificially induced conditions and is temporary. As Kathleen Wilkes notes, when some- one experiences temporary disunity as a result of a post-hypnotic \u00adsuggestion, or because of a fugue state involving memory loss, we don\u2019t take that to count against the claim that they have a single mind. So why should the temporary disunity exhibited by a split-brain sub- ject be treated any differently? As for claim 3, that each person has exactly one mind, this seems to be at the heart of our thinking about persons. For example, accord- ing to John Locke\u2019s influential account of personhood (1689/1974), a person is a thinking, intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can reflect on itself as itself (see Chapter 39). This account seems to presuppose that each person has only a single mind. A person with PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 276 two minds would not be able to reflect fully on itself as itself, since each mind would not be able to reflect on the contents of the other mind, and there is no way to reflect on the contents of both together. Philosophers have offered various responses to this puzzle. One common response tries to reject claim 1, that a split-brain has two minds. But there are different ways of rejecting this claim. Tim Bayne (2008) has suggested that a proper understanding of the notion of unity of consciousness allows us to attribute unity to split-brain pa- tients.",

    "question": "Do we typically treat temporary disunity in certain individuals as evidence against the claim that they have a single mind?",
    "answer": "No, we do not typically treat temporary disunity in certain individuals, such as those experiencing a fugue state or post-hypnotic suggestion, as evidence against the claim that they have a single mind. This suggests that temporary disunity in a split-brain subject should not be treated any differently.",
