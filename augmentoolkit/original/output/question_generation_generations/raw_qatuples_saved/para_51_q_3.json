    "paragraph": " Unlike these first two phenomena, change blindness is a condition that affects us all. Sometimes when we look first at one stimulus and then another, we fail to notice any differ- ence between the two\u2014even when the difference should be a glaring one. In developing theories of consciousness, philosophers have taken these puzzling phenomena to have important consequences.

Color, for example, is particular to vision\u2014someone without vision could not acquire the idea of color. Shape, on the other hand, appears to be an idea we can get both from vision\u2014by seeing the outline of a body\u2014and from touch\u2014 by feeling the edges of a body. Relatedly, Aristotle held that some qual- ities are perceivable only by a single sense\u2014again, only vision perceives color, only hearing perceives sound, etc.\u2014while other qualities are \u201ccommon sensibles\u201d and can be perceived by multiple senses; again, shape is a paradigm case, but size, number, and motion are arguably others. What, though, is the relationship between the different sensory representations of these common sensibles? What is the \u00adrelationship between the visual perception of shape and the tactile perception of shape? This is the issue that gives rise to Molyneux\u2019s problem. THE CASE Suppose someone has been blind since birth. Through touch, they learn how to distinguish between a cube and a sphere. They feel the 30 PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 186 corners of the cube and its six faces. They notice the stark contrast between that and the smooth feeling of the sphere. Now, suppose they are suddenly given sight and are presented with the cube and the sphere. Could they know, by sight alone, which one was the cube and which one was the sphere?",
