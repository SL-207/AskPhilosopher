    "paragraph": " While I might gain a concept of pain from seeing someone hopping around saying \u201couch,\u201d I gain a different concept of pain by having it. The latter concept is a phenom- enal concept. Phenomenal concepts are often discussed in contempo- rary debates about consciousness. For example, recall Frank Jackson\u2019s (1982) knowledge argument, which we discussed in Chapter 6. The Missing Shade of Blue 193 Recall that Mary learns all the physical truths there are about color vi- sion without ever seeing in color; she lives in a black-and-white room and gains all her knowledge from black-and-white books and videos. Then she leaves and finally sees red for herself. It is often said that seeing colors enables her to know that seeing red is like this, where this indicates the use of a phenomenal concept. Some conclude that pos- session of phenomenal concepts of a property depends on experiences of that property. If so, this might seem to undermine Jackson\u2019s claim that Mary would not be able to figure out, from within her room, what it\u2019s like to see red. If we can imagine the missing shade of blue without seeing that shade, then maybe Mary can imagine what it\u2019s like to see red without seeing it (Dennett 2007, Mandik 2010, Kind 2019). But the matter is contested. Imaginatively extrapolating the miss- ing shade is one thing; imaginatively extrapolating from black and white to color is quite another. And Torin Alter (2008) argues that the knowledge argument is not committed to the claim that every phenomenal concept can be traced to a corresponding experience. The argument implies that we cannot deduce certain truths involv- ing phenomenal concepts from truths involving only physical con- cepts (such as concepts of motion and space). But that is a much weaker principle, which is not threatened by the missing shade of blue case. In addition to connecting with contemporary debates about phe- nomenal concepts, the missing shade of blue case also connects with contemporary debates about the limits of imagination.",

    "question": "What is an example of a debate about phenomenal concepts, and what is the central argument in that debate?",
    "answer": "The debate about phenomenal concepts, as exemplified by Frank Jackson's knowledge argument, concerns whether the possession of phenomenal concepts (such as the concept of what it's like to see red) depends on experiencing the property itself. The central argument is that Mary, who learns all physical truths about color vision without seeing in color, would not be able to figure out what it's like to see red without experiencing it herself.",
