    "paragraph": " It can occur in the complete absence of any brain states, and, indeed, of any physical states altogether. If this is possible, then the particular pain under consideration cannot itself be a physical state. Contrary to what the physicalist claims, the pain is an irreducibly mental state. In saying that it is irreducible, Gertler means that it does not reduce to physical states. For comparison, consider a glass of water. Arguably, the water in that glass is nothing more than a collection of H2O molecules. In other words, the water reduces to H2O, and H2O itself reduces to bonded hydrogen and oxygen atoms. By contrast, ac- cording to Gertler, pain does not reduce to any physical state. DISCUSSION A related scenario has also been posed by W. D. Hart (1988); though, un- like Gertler, he does not focus on pain. Rather, he focuses on visualizing The Disembodied Pain 15 oneself disembodied (see also Chapter 1). Hart moves us slowly in im- agination from embodiment to disembodiment. You\u2019re asked to im- agine waking up in your usual embodied state. Before you open your eyes, you carefully walk over to the mirror. In front of the mirror, when you raise your eyelids, you see empty eye sockets. You then peel back the top of your skull, and you can see that your entire skull is empty. There is no brain inside. As you stare into the mirror, the rest of your body slowly seems to melt away. By visualizing what you would see in the mirror once the entirety of your body has \u00addisappeared, you are able to conceive of yourself in a completely disembodied state. Again, on the assumption that whatever is conceivable is possible, we get to the conclusion that physicalism must be false and that dualism must be true. Arguments that rely on this assumption\u2014that whatever is \u00adconceivable is possible\u2014are often referred to as conceivability \u00adarguments. Many arguments concerning the mind\u2013body problem and the \u00adnature of consciousness take this basic form: that is, they begin with a claim about what is conceivable and move to a claim about what is \u00adpossible.",

    "question": "What is the assumption underlying conceivability arguments, such as the one presented in the scenario of visualizing a disembodied state?",
    "answer": "The assumption underlying conceivability arguments is that whatever is conceivable is possible. This assumption is often used to argue that physicalism must be false and that dualism must be true.",
