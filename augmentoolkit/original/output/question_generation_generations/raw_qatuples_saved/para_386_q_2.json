    "paragraph": " Moreover, if the statue is smushed, the clay remains but the statue is gone. If the Buddha\u2019s left ear breaks off and another piece of clay\u2014or even some other material\u2014is molded to replace it, the statue remains though the original lump of clay doesn\u2019t. If the statue is identical to the clay, how can either one exist without the other? If they\u2019re not identical, there PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 270 seem to be two distinct entities in the same place at the same time. Here there is no temptation to say that the statue is some shadowy, supernatural entity, related in some way to the clay. But if the statue and the clay are distinct, what is the statue if not the clay, and what is the relationship between these two entities? A number of philosophers argue that, though the statue is not identical to the clay, it is constituted by it. Before the artist made the statue, the clay did not constitute a statue, and after some clay was removed and then replaced, something different\u2014a different bunch of clay\u2014constitutes the statue. Baker argues we should say something \u00adsimilar for the relationship between persons and their bodies. I am not \u00adidentical to my body, just as the statue is not identical to the clay. \u00adNevertheless, I am constituted by a particular physical body. If my body survives in a vegetative state, the body, the human animal, is there but it no longer constitutes a person\u2014it is like a lump of clay no longer constituting a statue. How does the constitution view respond to the animalist \u00adargument? The natural response is to say that the conclusion is true: you are the human animal in the chair. But this doesn\u2019t mean you are identical with that human animal; instead, you are constituted by it. Are there now too many minds\u2014my mind and the mind of the human animal? No. That would be double counting. Compare: the statue weighs 10 pounds and the clay it is made of weighs 10 pounds.",

    "question": "A philosopher argues that the statue is not identical to the clay, but it is constituted by it. What does this mean?",
    "answer": "This means that the statue is composed of the clay, and the clay makes up the statue. The statue is not the same as the clay, but it is formed from the clay.",
