    "paragraph": " Indeed, his intense dislike of the thing in question might well on the whole be good, as it would be if its positive contribu\u00ad tory value is greater than its negative intrinsic value. Such occasional dislikings of indifferent things, though doubtless intrinsically bad at least to some slight degree, need not and frequently do not manifest a lack of magnanimity. But the person who pervasively dislikes indif\u00ad ferent things does thereby manifest a lamentable lack of magnanimity concerning such things even though he be quite magnanimous in var\u00ad ious other respects, and it is because of this that such dislike is intrinsi\u00ad cally bad. It is because the nature of magnanimity is such that its instances are intrinsically good and therefore that the nature of the vice opposed to magnanimity is such that its instances are intrinsically bad, coupled with the fact that the pervasive dislike of indifferent things is a specific form of the vice opposed to magnanimity, that such pervasive dislike is also intrinsically bad. If, that is, the nature of a given genus is such that all its instances are intrinsically bad, then so also are all the instances of any of the species comprehended by that genus. But if a pervasive dis\u00ad like of indifferent things is intrinsically bad, then so also are particular instances of such dislike on the part of a person who does not generally dislike such things. Although particular occasional instances of such dislike, taken singly, are not as bad as a pervasive dislike of such things, they are still at least slightly bad, if for no other reason than that a person who occasionally dislikes particular indifferent things, even Attitudes toward the Indifferent 1 95 though he does not pervasively dislik\u041d them, is less magnanimous than he would otherwise be. As such slightly bad instances of such dislike on the part of a given person become i_ncreasingly frequent, his magna\u00ad nimity correspondingly diminishes, and he becomes in that respect a worse person than he would otherwise be even though he remains mag\u00ad nanimous in other respects and continues to like good things and good likings and dislikings of others and to dislike bad things and bad likings and dislikings of others.",

    "question": "Is it possible for a person to dislike indifferent things occasionally without being considered a less magnanimous person?",
    "answer": "No, it is not possible for a person to dislike indifferent things occasionally without being considered a less magnanimous person. Even occasional dislike of indifferent things can indicate a lack of magnanimity and lead to a diminishment of magnanimity over time.",
