Journal of Philosophy 75: 229\u2013249. 3 A STRANGE COUNTY (FAKE\u00a0BARNS) Background: Two of the earliest responses to the Gettier Problem were to opt for a causal account of knowledge or to accept the no false reasons/ evidence response (see Promotions and Traveling Friends pp. 6\u201311 and A Grisly Discovery pp. 12\u201315). As has been common in the literature sur- rounding the Gettier Problem, soon after these responses were proposed new Gettier-style examples were put forward. These examples revealed that both the causal account of knowledge and the no false reasons/evidence response failed to solve the Gettier Problem. The problem with the causal account (aside from the counterexample described in the previous entry) is that it seems that there can be Gettier-style cases where the fact that p causes one\u2019s true belief in what seems to be the appropriate way, and yet one fails to know that p. The problem with the no false reasons/evidence response is that it relies on the subject making an explicit inference, i.e. reasoning from a justified false belief, but it is possible to construct Gettier-style examples where it doesn\u2019t seem that the subject is engaging in an inference at all. After this problem became clear, other responses were proposed. Many of these responses had the common feature of trying to restrict the reasoning or evidence that the subject is allowed to rely upon if knowledge is to be gen- erated. However, a key feature of these sorts of responses is that they didn\u2019t put restrictions upon the environmental conditions in which the subject is found. It is this feature of fake barn scenarios like the one described in this FAKE BARNS 17 entry that undermines the effectiveness of these modifications of the no false reasons/evidence response as well as the effectiveness of the causal theory of knowledge when it comes to solving the Gettier Problem.",
