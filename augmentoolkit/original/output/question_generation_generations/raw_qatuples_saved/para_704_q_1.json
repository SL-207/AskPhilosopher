    "paragraph": " If we take the test to be definitive, and thereby deny that the coffee is tasting any different to Sanborn from how it tasted in the past, then we would be overriding Sanborn\u2019 own subjec- tive assessment of her qualia. After all, Sanborn insists that the coffee tastes different to her now. If we accept that she could be wrong about that, then it looks like she is no longer directly apprehending those qualia; if she were, says Dennett, then she would know what they are like. On the other hand, to check things with Chase, suppose that we subject him to a bunch of tests where he is asked to re-identify sam- ples of coffee, tea, and other beverages. If he does poorly at these tests, we might doubt his claim that the company\u2019s coffee still tastes the same to him. Insofar as we\u2019d be willing to override an individual\u2019s own subjective assessments of their qualia, it again looks like we\u2019re denying that qualitative experience is directly or immediately apprehensible to consciousness. Either way, it looks like we\u2019re departing from our initial notion of qualia. As Dennett says (1988, p. 60), if we accept that individuals have to do tests or consult experts in order to confirm what qualia they\u2019re having, then we\u2019ve \u201csurely\u201d moved \u201cfar away from our original idea of qualia as properties with which we have a particularly intimate acquaintance.\u201d Now let\u2019s take this one step further. Suppose we try to explain why Chase\u2019s qualia might be different from how they were before. A natural explanation would be to say that his shifting preferences have affected the way the coffee tastes to him\u2014that is, that it\u2019s precisely because his CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 52 preferences have changed that the taste has changed. Wine, for exam- ple, is often said to be an acquired taste. But what happens when you acquire that taste? One natural way to describe things would be to say that, as you come to appreciate certain aspects of the wine\u2019s flavor, your qualitative experience changes.",

    "question": "If someone performs poorly on tests designed to confirm their subjective assessment of their qualia, what does this imply about the nature of their qualitative experience?",
    "answer": "It implies that their subjective assessment of their qualia may be incorrect, and that they are not directly apprehending those qualia. This would suggest that qualitative experience is not directly or immediately apprehensible to consciousness.",
