    "paragraph": " Because identity is a one-to-one rela- tion, you are not identical to your upload in cases of nondestructive uploading\u2014that is, cases in which your consciousness is retained in your biological body while also being uploaded into a machine. But, even if your upload is not identical to you, the upload has just about everything we care about in survival. When thinking about your \u00adfuture, then, Parfit suggests that you shouldn\u2019t focus on whether some future being is identical to you, but rather whether and to what extent you are related in relevant ways to some future being. Such relevant PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 266 ways might include relating to that future being by memory and/ or other psychological features. Whatever the relevant features are, in Parfit\u2019s view, personal identity is not one of them. Contrary to what is often assumed, personal identity is not what we should care about when thinking about our futures. RECOMMENDED READING CANONICAL PRESENTATION Schneider, Susan. 2019.
