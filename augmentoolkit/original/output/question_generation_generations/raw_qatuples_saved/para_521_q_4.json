    "paragraph": " On this view, a proposition is true just in case it would be believed without doubt after learning all there is to know about the topic. Fellow pragmatist William James developed a different pragmatic theory of truth. According to James, a proposition is true when acting on the basis of accept- ing the proposition makes us successful at our endeavors. Of course, there are important differences between these theories, and there are serious problems with such accounts of truth aside from what we are going to discuss in this entry, but the key point to notice here is that they are both committed to all truths being knowable. For Peirce, something is true only if we would believe it after an ideal investigation; presumably, this means that the truth must be knowable. Similarly, for James, we can\u2019t act on the basis of accepting a proposition unless we are in a position to believe the proposition, which suggests that the proposition must be knowable. There are numerous other antirealist views (not just about the nature of truth) that are committed to the idea that in order for a proposition to be true, it must be knowable (note this doesn\u2019t mean that they are committed to all truths being known\u2014only that all truths are in principle knowable). PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 232 EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: KNOWABILITY PARADOX The Knowability Paradox yields a problem for any theory that is committed to the idea that all truths are knowable because it seems to show that this commitment forces one to accept that all truths are actually known by someone. Here\u2019s a simple expression of the Knowa- bility Paradox. We start with an assumption that seems pretty safe\u2014 let\u2019s assume that there is some truth that no one knows. Let\u2019s call this truth (since we don\u2019t know its content\u2014if we did know its content, it wouldn\u2019t be unknown, after all) \u201cUNKNOWN\u201d. So, UNKNOWN is true, but no one knows it. Of course, this means that it is true that \u201cUNKNOWN is true and not known\u201d.",

    "question": "What is the name given to the unknown truth in this paradox, and what significance does its name have?",
    "answer": "The unknown truth is called \"UNKNOWN\". This name is significant because it highlights that its content is unknown, and that it cannot be specified because its existence is what is being assumed.",
