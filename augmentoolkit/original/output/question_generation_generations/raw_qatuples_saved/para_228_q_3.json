    "paragraph": " This response denies that belief ascriptions are governed by norms about what an agent can or cannot rationally believe. While this solution does, in a sense, divorce what is believed from the rational significance of the belief for the agent, defenders can claim that rational significance is captured by the way that propositions are believed, not by the propositions themselves. So, for example, while Pierre does believe the propositions that London is pretty and that Lon- don is not pretty, he believes them in ways, or under guises, that hide the inconsistency. His rationality is governed by the way he believes prop- ositions, not the propositions he believes. While philosophers who take this stance needn\u2019t accept the Millian principle, they often do, taking the same stance in traditional Hesperus/Phosphorus cases. (Although their views differ in important ways, this view is defended by Braun (1998), Salmon (1986), Soames (2002), and others.) CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 176 In the second camp are those who want to hold onto the intui- tion that belief ascriptions should capture the cognitive significance of the belief for the subject. We needn\u2019t ascribe contradictory beliefs to Pierre. In general, these philosophers argue that, while it is true that \u201cLondon is pretty\u201d is a translation of \u201cLondres est jolie,\u201d and they both mean that London is pretty, Pierre is still thinking about London in two different ways. So far this is consistent with the strategy taken by philosophers in the first camp; but the crucial difference is that \u00adphilosophers in the second camp believe these \u201cways of thinking\u201d make a difference to the content of Pierre\u2019s beliefs. Perhaps (at least part of) the content of the belief Pierre expresses by \u201cLondres est jolie\u201d is that the city in the postcard is pretty, and (at least part of) the content of the belief he expresses by \u201cLondon is not pretty\u201d is that the city he lives in is not pretty (Sosa 1996, Bach 1997).",

    "answer": "Philosophers in the second camp believe that when two propositions are assigned to an agent, it is because the agent is thinking about the same subject matter in two different ways.",
