    "paragraph": " There are various possible answers to our question. Some may be la\u00ad beled \"extreme,\" others \"moderate\". The extreme answers maintain that any instance of liking, disliking, or being indifferent toward an in\u00ad different thing is itself one, but only one, of the three-good, bad, or in\u00ad different. On this view ( 1) any instance of liking an indifferent things is one, but only one, of the three-good, bad, or indifferent; (2) any in\u00ad stance of disliking an indifferent thing is one, but only one, of the three-good, bad, or indifferent; and ( 3) any instance of being indif\u00ad ferent to an indifferent thing is one, but only one, of the three-good, bad, or indifferent. The moderate answers, on the other hand, maintain ( 1) that some instances of liking an indifferent thing are good, some bad, and some indifferent; (2) that some instances of disliking an indifferent thing are good, some bad, and some indifferent; and ( 3) that some in\u00ad stances of being indifferent toward an indifferent thing are good, some Attitudes toward the Indifferent l 77 bad, and some indifferent. Thus on the moderate answer some instances of liking, some instances of disliking, and some instances of being indif\u00ad ferent toward indifferent things are .good, some bad, and some indif\u00ad ferent. We turn first to consider the extreme answers. The extreme answer that most will perhaps find to have the greatest initial plausibility is the view ( 1) that any instance of being indifferent toward an indifferent thing is good and (2) that any instance of liking or disliking an indifferent thing is either bad or indifferent. In support of such a view one might argue that if a thing is indifferent the appro\u00ad priate attitude to take toward it is to be indifferent toward it and thus neither to like nor to dislike it. If so, then being indifferent toward it is good and liking or disliking it bad or at least indifferent. A proponent of this view might also argue that if the appropriate attitude to take toward an indifferent thing is an attitude of indifference, then liking or disliking such a thing, rather than being indifferent, must instead be bad.",
