    "paragraph": " So, was Twain two persons all along? If so, what does that say about the rest of us? After all, setting aside his epilepsy, Twain\u2019s brain was no different from any of ours prior to his commissurotomy. We too have two different hemispheres that could be separated from one another. Following Elizabeth Schechter (2018), we can refer to the puzzle generated by split-brain cases as the unity puzzle. As she describes it, the unity puzzle consists of three claims that are each independently plausible but that jointly result in a contradiction. The three claims making up the inconsistent triad are as follows: (1) A split-brain sub- ject has two minds. (2) A split-brain subject is a single person. (3) Each person has exactly one mind. (See also Wilkes 1988, pp. 141\u20133.) DISCUSSION Let\u2019s start by explaining why each claim in the inconsistent triad seems plausible. Split Brains and the Unity\u00a0Puzzle 275 In support of claim 1, that a split-brain subject like Twain has two minds, we might invoke considerations relating to the unity of consciousness. Generally speaking, we take a subject of conscious experience to be a single unified entity. If a subject is consciously experiencing an itch on their back and a pain in their right knee, then these two experiences get integrated as aspects of their overall conscious experience. This is not true of the split-brain patient, as when Twain\u2019s simultaneous visual experiences of \u201che\u201d and \u201cart\u201d are not integrated with one another. Relatedly, if a subject is consciously having experiences, these should be accessible via introspection. But this does not seem to be true in the case of Twain, as there seems to be no single subject who can introspectively access both the visual experience of \u201che\u201d and \u201cart.\u201d Finally, the conscious mental states of a single subject would typically be internally consistent. While any of us might suffer from occasional irrationality, as a general matter a single conscious subject cannot consciously think \u201cthere is a phone in my left hand\u201d and \u201cthere is not a phone in my left hand\u201d simultaneously as Twain seems to be able to do.",

    "question": "Why does claim 1, that a split-brain subject has two minds, seem plausible?",
    "answer": "Claim 1 seems plausible for several reasons:\n1. We typically take a subject of conscious experience to be a single unified entity.\n2. A split-brain patient like Twain does not seem to integrate their conscious experiences, such as when they have simultaneous visual experiences that are not accessible to each other.\n3. Introspection does not seem to work for split-brain patients, who cannot access both visual experiences at the same time.",
