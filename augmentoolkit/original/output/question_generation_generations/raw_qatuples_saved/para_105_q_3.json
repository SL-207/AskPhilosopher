    "paragraph": " The problem also seems to plague causal theories of knowledge. Martha\u2019s belief that she sees a barn is caused by the real barn in the way that such beliefs would normally be caused. So, it is a mystery how a causal theory of knowledge could yield the intuitive result that this true belief of Martha\u2019s doesn\u2019t amount to knowledge. RESPONSES A bit of history about the \u201cfake barn\u201d Gettier cases before discussing the philosophical issues. Often, the idea for these cases is credited to Alvin Goldman because of his widely known early discussion of FAKE BARNS 19 such cases. However, Fred Dretske and Carl Ginet (Goldman actually credits Ginet with coming up with the examples) offered serious dis- cussions of such examples before Goldman (in the case of Dretske, the discussion was in print several years before Goldman\u2019s presentation). Now, let\u2019s discuss the cases themselves. Unlike the cases originally used to motivate the Gettier Problem, there is a sizeable number of epistemologists who deny the intuition at play here (empirical re- search (see Cola\u00e7o et al. 2014) suggests that nonphilosophers may be inclined to deny this as well). They maintain that when Martha sees the one real barn she knows that it is a barn. One way this response has been motivated is by considering variations of the case where Martha is continually looking at the real barn while moving in and out of Barn County (roughly, one idea is to imagine that a river runs through Barn County and Martha is on a boat with a real barn on it that she looks at while she passes through the land filled with barn fa\u00e7ades) (Gendler and Hawthorne 2005). Many epistemologists deny that Martha knows that what she sees is a barn though. Some of the responses to the original Gettier cases are thought to solve the problem here as well. Most commonly, con- sideration of fake barn cases is used to motivate modal requirements on knowledge such as safety and sensitivity.",
