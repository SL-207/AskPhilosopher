    "paragraph": " In line with this criticism, some philosophers have suggested that we should jettison the Turing Test because it fails to set an appropri- ate goal for the field of artificial intelligence (Hayes and Ford 1995). According to this line of criticism, focus on passing the Turing Test forces researchers to work towards an unreasonable and perhaps un- reachable goal. Moreover, it requires researchers to spend too much time worrying about issues irrelevant to intelligence\u2014for example, mimicking the speed of typical human response or mimicking the kind of common errors that humans might make. In short, working to develop machines that pass the Turing Test might not be the best way to achieve machine intelligence. A different kind of criticism of the Turing Test worries that it sets too low a standard for the attribution of intelligence. This kind of criticism has been offered by John Searle (1980), who claims that we can see the central problem with the Turing Test by way of a first-person thought experiment. If we imagine a scenario in which we ourselves are furnished with a sufficiently powerful rulebook, we can see that we could produce answers to questions without actually having any genuine understanding of what we were doing. We could do this without knowing what either the questions or the answers mean. Since all a computer does is work with that kind of rulebook, we should thus conclude that the computer doesn\u2019t have any gen- uine understanding either. We will discuss this thought experiment, commonly known as the Chinese Room, in the next chapter. Other philosophers have raised related worries, focusing not just on under- standing but on consciousness. A machine that passes the Turing Test might just be a very good actor\u2014so good that it can fool us into thinking that it is consciously thinking even though it lacks con- sciousness altogether. In response to this kind of worry, Susan Schneider (2019) has sug- gested that we should move beyond our sole focus on the Turing Test and use alternative tests in addition (or instead) when trying to determine whether machines can think (see also Harnad 1991).",
