    "paragraph": " However, the Equivalence condition yields that observing the white piece of chalk also confirms \u201call ravens are black\u201d because this is logi- cally equivalent to \u201call nonblack things are non-ravens\u201d. But what does a white piece of chalk have to do with the color of ravens?! Intuitively, it seems that observing pieces of chalk (regardless of their colors) tells us nothing about the color of ravens. And yet, if the Equivalence con- dition and the Nicod condition are true, it seems that observing white chalk can give us evidence for thinking that all ravens are black. This is the Ravens Paradox (sometimes called the \u201cConfirmation Paradox\u201d). RESPONSES One response is to simply accept that there is no problem here. In fact, when Carl Hempel originally presented the Ravens Paradox, he took it to simply show that observing a white piece of chalk confirms \u201call PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 214 ravens are black\u201d (1937, 1945). Many have been uncomfortable with following Hempel\u2019s acceptance of this conclusion, however. Before considering other responses, it is worth noting that it has been argued that the Ravens Paradox and the New Riddle of Induction/ Grue Problem (see A Gruesome Riddle pp. 207\u2013211) are logically equiv- alent (Boyce 2014). This is important because if it is correct and the two really are logically equivalent, then any solution to one is automatically a solution to the other. Hence, if this line of reasoning is right, any of the responses to the New Riddle of Induction considered in the previous entry have the potential to be a response to the Ravens \u00adParadox as well. That said, most respond to these two problems differently. There is a notable exception to the general trend to respond to the Ravens Paradox and the New Riddle of Induction differently though. As we saw in the previous entry, one way of responding to the New Riddle of Induction involves arguing that \u201cgreen\u201d picks out a natural kind, whereas \u201cgrue\u201d doesn\u2019t.",

    "question": "Why might it be useful to consider the New Riddle of Induction in relation to the Ravens Paradox?",
    "answer": "It has been argued that the Ravens Paradox and the New Riddle of Induction are logically equivalent. If this is correct, then any solution to one paradox is automatically a solution to the other. This means that any response to the New Riddle of Induction could potentially also be a response to the Ravens Paradox.",
