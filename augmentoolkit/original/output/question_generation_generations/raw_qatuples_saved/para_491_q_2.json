One can believe that grass is green, hope that grass is green, desire that grass is green, etc. The relevant propositions are sometimes described as mental contents, which in turn are often described as containing concepts or notions, such as the concept of being green. Features of one\u2019s environment often causally influence which prop- ositions one believes, desires, etc. For example, seeing grass typically causes one to form beliefs about it. But do the contents that figure into one\u2019s propositional attitudes depend constitutively on one\u2019s en- vironment? That is, are features of the environment part of the nature of one\u2019s propositional attitudes? According to internalism (also known as individualism), the answer is no. In principle, one might have ex- actly the same mental states even if one\u2019s external environment were radically different\u2014indeed, even if it were some sort of illusion. Tyler Burge (1979, 1982) disagrees. He argues for externalism (his term for this view is \u201canti-individualism\u201d). 25 CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 154 Externalism might seem easy to establish. Suppose at noon Alfred is looking at an apple. He believes it to be wholesome, and his belief is true: the apple is indeed wholesome. A minute later, when he looks away for a few seconds, the wholesome apple is replaced with a rotten one, which looks the same from the outside. Alfred turns back toward the apple but doesn\u2019t notice the change. We might describe him as having different belief contents at noon and at 12:01. After all, his \u00adearlier belief is true and his later belief is false. Even so, his internal states remain constant (in relevant respects).",

    "answer": "According to internalism, the contents that figure into one's propositional attitudes do not depend on the environment. According to externalism, the contents of one's propositional attitudes do depend on the environment.",
