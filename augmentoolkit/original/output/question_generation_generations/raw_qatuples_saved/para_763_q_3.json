    "paragraph": " This happens frequently in situations in which we are deliberating about which of two or more possible courses of action we ought to undertake. Usually such deliberation will include a consideration of what seem to us to be the probable consequences of choosing one pos\u00ad sible course of action as opposed to others. Prior to our choice, each of the possible courses of action and its probable consequences have no being at all independently of our consideration of them. They are instead only intentional objects for us, and are such objects for us only if and only so long as we think of them. Yet it is precisely the value of such intentional objects that we in our deliberation are endeavoring to determine. Or, if one prefer, it is precisely what would be the value of each course of action and its probable consequences if it were under\u00ad taken and if its probable consequences did in fact ensue that we are attempting to ascertain. Yet even in this second way of describing the situation involved in deliberation, it is still the value of what are only intentional objects for us prior to our choosing and acting that we are endeavoring to determine. Even, that is, if it is not the value of each of Value and Psychological Phenomena 5 the possible courses of action and it\u043b probable consequences as inten\u00ad tional objects for us that we are attempting to ascertain, but instead what would be the value of each possible course of action and its prob\u00ad able consequences if it were in fact chosen and if its probable conse\u00ad quences did in fact ensue, each possible course of action and its prob\u00ad able consequences are still during the process of deliberation only intentional objects for us. At least one of the purposes of deliberation is that it helps us to choose wisely between possible courses of action by attempting prior to choice and action to assess what would be the value of each of the courses of action open to us and of its probable conse\u00ad quences if it were chosen and if its probable consequences did in fact ensue.",

    "answer": "Even if it's not their value as intentional objects for you that you're attempting to ascertain, but instead what would be the value of each possible course of action and its probable consequences if it were in fact chosen and if its probable consequences did in fact ensue, the possible courses of action and their probable consequences are still during the process of deliberation only intentional objects for you.",
