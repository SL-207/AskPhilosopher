    "paragraph": " However, it was later shown that reliabilism isn\u2019t the only theory targeted\u2014any basic knowledge structure theory faces this problem. RESPONSES One response to this sort of situation is to argue that the problem here is that the process is \u201crule-circular\u201d (it uses a rule/faculty to sup- port the use of that very rule/faculty), and that rule-circularity cannot produce knowledge or justification (Vogel 2008). A version of this response doesn\u2019t prohibit the use of rule-circular methods in general, but rather claims that such methods can only be legitimately used when one isn\u2019t already doubtful about the rule/faculty being tested (Bergmann 2004). Consequently, this sort of response says that the problem in Stew\u2019s case isn\u2019t that he is using his vision to show that his vision is reliable. Instead, the problem lies in the fact that Stew has BOOTSTRAPPING/EASY KNOWLEDGE 97 reason to doubt that his vision is reliable, and yet he is still using it to establish that his vision is reliable. A different sort of response argues that the problem here is that such bootstrapping processes fail to track the truth (Roush 2005). The processes aren\u2019t really sensitive to the truth of whether Stew\u2019s vision is reliable or not. After all, Stew would end up with the same belief that his color vision is reliable by using this test even if his vision was actually horribly unreliable. It is because of this feature that it may be claimed that this process doesn\u2019t give Stew any evidence concerning the reliability of his vision. A somewhat related response is to argue that the problem here is that Stew is using a \u201cno-lose\u201d method (Titelbaum 2010). In other words, Stew is gathering information about his color vision in such a way that he cannot get any evidence that goes against its reliability. This response insists that such methods cannot produce knowledge/ justification. A different sort of response holds that the way to respond to this sort of case is to insist that one cannot combine basic knowledge (that a particular card is red) with reflective knowledge (that the card looks red) (McCain and Moretti forthcoming).",

    "question": "What is a \"no-lose\" method, and why is it problematic?",
    "answer": "A \"no-lose\" method is a way of gathering information about a particular thing (e.g. the reliability of Stew's vision) in such a way that one cannot get any evidence that goes against its reliability. This method is problematic because it does not allow for the possibility of obtaining evidence that challenges the reliability of the thing being tested.",
