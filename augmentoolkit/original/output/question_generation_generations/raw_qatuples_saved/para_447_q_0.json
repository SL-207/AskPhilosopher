    "paragraph": " RESPONSES The most popular response to the dogmatism puzzle is to insist that an underlying assumption of the above reasoning is false (Harman 1973, Conee 2004). The underlying assumption is that knowledge is indefeasible. Claiming that knowledge is indefeasible amounts to claim- ing that when you currently know that p you also know that p at any later time when you believe p for the same reasons that you do now. In other words, your knowledge cannot be defeated by additional in- formation as long as you believe for the same reasons as you do when you now have that knowledge. Many philosophers argue that knowl- edge is in fact defeasible though. So, they contend you might know that p now and believe it for the same reasons later, and yet fail to know that p at this later time. Take the Super Bowl example again. You know that the Chicago Bears won Super Bowl XX now because\u00a0you read it in this book. However, this response claims that later when you gain evidence against this claim your knowledge will be defeated. Hence, you will no longer know that the Chicago Bears won Super Bowl XX. Of course, since at this later time you no longer know that the Chicago Bears won Super Bowl XX, you aren\u2019t in a position to rea- sonably ignore evidence for or against this claim. PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 220 While it may seem that accepting that knowledge is defeasible gets us out of the dogmatism puzzle, some argue that it doesn\u2019t fully succeed (Lasonen-Aarnio 2014). They worry about situations where you gain evidence that weakens your support for believing p without making it so that you fail to know p. It seems that in such cases, you will still be in a position to ignore this evidence, since you still know that p, and so, know that the evidence against p must be misleading. But this still seems problematically dogmatic\u2014you shouldn\u2019t ignore this evidence. Thus, some philosophers argue that accepting that knowledge is defeasible isn\u2019t enough to solve the dog- matism puzzle.",
