    "paragraph": " Shall we just say that her senses have gotten cross-wired? Though the description may seem apt, it doesn\u2019t provide us with much of an ex- planation of what\u2019s going on, but rather seems simply to re-describe the case. Perhaps instead we should deny that Cyndi\u2019s experience is per- ceptual in nature. Perhaps we should say that she\u2019s merely imagining green. But this too seems implausible. Typically, imagination is volun- tarily produced, but Cyndi would deny that her experience of green is something that she\u2019s voluntarily producing. Also, we can usually tell when we\u2019re imagining and when we\u2019re perceiving; but it doesn\u2019t feel to Cyndi like she\u2019s imagining. Moreover, tests reveal that her experi- ence of the sound of pouring orange juice and the sensation of green are stably coordinated for her over a long period of time. The con- nection between the sound and the color seems to be too tight and too immediate for it to be simply an imaginative association or some other learned association of ideas. And there\u2019s nothing special about Cyndi. Tests on other synesthetes reveal similar results. For example, consider a typical color-grapheme synesthete whom we\u2019ll call Jade. For Jade, the number 2 appears red (see Ramachandran and Hubbard 2001). She is presented with an array of numbers printed in green ink. All of them are 5s except for a few 2s that are scattered throughout the array. When asked to point out the 2s, Jade can almost instantly PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 220 locate them. She can locate them in the same amount of time it takes for non-synesthetes to do so when the 5s are printed in black and the 2s are printed in some other bright color). As Jade tells the researchers, because the 2s appear red to her, they \u201cpop out\u201d from the 5s. Her per- formance on these tests suggest to the researchers that the triggered colors must be genuinely perceptual in nature\u2014that is, they are being processed by her visual system.",

    "question": "What happens when a synesthete is presented with a list of numbers with some of them printed in a color that is not typically associated with the number, and the others printed in a different color?",
    "answer": "The synesthete can quickly and accurately identify the numbers that are printed in the color that they typically associate with the number. For example, if a person typically sees the number 2 as red, they will be able to quickly spot the 2s in a list of numbers even if they are printed in a different color, such as green. This suggests that the synesthete's experience of perceiving colors and numbers is automatic and not something that they can control.",
