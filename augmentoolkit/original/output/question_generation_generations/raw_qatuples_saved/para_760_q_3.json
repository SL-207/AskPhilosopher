    "paragraph": " On this way of looking at things, we could see Churchland as a type-C materialist whose view collapses into type-A materialism. In short, such a view suggests that the way the problem will ultimately be solved will be to explain the functions of consciousness, with the explanation likely being something that is hard to predict or anticipate given our current state of understanding. In virtue of our current ignorance of what a possible explanation The Hornswoggle Problem 59 could look like, we are hornswoggled into thinking that no such ex- planation is possible. If this interpretation of Churchland is correct, then her argument can be addressed in similar fashion as other type-A materialist re- sponses (see Chapter 11). For example, one might try to undercut the various scientist analogies that she draws in an effort to show that there is something different about the problem of consciousness. The scientific analogies involve cases where it was clear that what we were trying to explain involved functions. For example, in the case of life, it\u2019s hard to see how there is anything to be explained over and above the functions involved\u2014how, for example, a living mammal manages to circulate its blood. But this fact differentiates the case of life (and the other scientific cases) from the case of consciousness. With respect to consciousness, the problem is not that we don\u2019t see how the func- tions could be explained, but rather that there seems to be something beyond functions for which we need to account (see Chapter 4).

    "question": "Do you think that the Hornswoggle Problem is a genuine challenge to our understanding of consciousness, or is it simply a reflection of our current ignorance and limitations?",
    "answer": "I think that the Hornswoggle Problem is a reflection of our current ignorance and limitations, rather than a genuine challenge to our understanding of consciousness. While we may not currently have a clear understanding of how consciousness can be explained, it is possible that future research and discoveries will provide new insights and perspectives that will help to address this problem.",
