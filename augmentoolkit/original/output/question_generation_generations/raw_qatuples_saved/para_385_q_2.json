    "paragraph": " Imagine if you were going to buy a car and you wanted to know whether the salesperson was trustworthy. How convinced would you be if the salesperson said to you \u201clook, you want to know whether I\u2019m trustworthy? Just ask me. I\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m trustworthy.\u201d A salesperson telling you that they are trustworthy is not very good evidence for thinking they\u2019re trustworthy, is it? You might worry that using your memory to show that your memory is reliable amounts to the same thing. Let\u2019s sum up. It seems that it is possible (in the broadest sense of the term) that the universe is only five minutes old, and it could be that a five minutes old universe is indistinguishable from how the universe actually is. Consideration of this possibility seems to gen- erate two different skeptical challenges. The first is skepticism about the past, which challenges our knowledge of the past. The second is memory skepticism, which challenges whether our memory can give us knowledge at all. The difference between these two forms of skepticism can be seen if we consider a possibility where Russell\u2019s five-minutes-old universe hypothesis is true, but in this scenario our memory works fine. In such a case, memory would allow us to know things from less than five minutes ago. However, anything from more than five minutes ago would be false. Hence, it is at least possible to challenge our knowledge of the past while granting that the faculty of memory works well enough to give us knowledge. RESPONSES When it comes to the first skeptical challenge, skepticism about the past, it\u2019s structurally similar to external world skepticism. Conse- quently, it\u2019s not surprising that many of the sorts of responses that have been put forward in reply to external world skepticism have also been used to respond to it. We won\u2019t rehearse those responses again here (see Descartes\u2019 Demon pp. 55\u201360). RUSSELL\u2019S FIVE MINUTES OLD UNIVERSE 69 When it comes to skepticism about the reliability of memory, things appear to be different because the question of circularity takes center stage.",

    "question": "Consider a scenario where the universe is only 5 minutes old, but your memory works perfectly. What would be the implications of this scenario for your knowledge of the past?",
    "answer": "* You would be able to know things that happened in the last 5 minutes, because your memory would be working perfectly for that time period.\n* However, you would not be able to trust your memory for anything that happened more than 5 minutes ago, because in a 5-minute-old universe, all memories from before that time would be false.\n\n**QUESTION:\u202c\nWhat is the structural similarity between skepticism about the past and external world skepticism?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThey are structurally similar in that many of the same responses that have been put forward in reply to external world skepticism can also be used to respond to skepticism about the past.",
