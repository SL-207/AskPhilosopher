    "paragraph": " Folk psychology is a \u201ctheory\u201d in the sense that it might turn out to be false; but it is not an explicit theory in the science of psychology. Functionalism\u2003 The theory that mental states are functional states. Functional states are states consisting of (i) environmental stimuli, (ii) behavioral responses, and (iii) relations among mental states. For example, according to functionalism, human pain is that mental state that (very roughly) is typically (i) caused by damage to the body, (ii) causes wincing and saying things such as \u201couch,\u201d and (iii) combines with other mental states (such as the desire to avoid the state and the belief that aspirin will help one do that) to cause one to take aspirin. Human pain, on this theory, is whatever state plays that role in humans, e.g., a certain brain state. However, functionalism is not a theory about what realizes or implements mental states in humans. Just as a functional descrip- tion of a hammer (e.g., as a tool for banging in nails) does not tell you what actual hammers are made of, functionalism does not Glossary 318 tell you whether in humans the mind is realized by a brain or an immaterial soul. Nevertheless, functionalists are often physical- ists, who say that all mental phenomena are realized by physical phenomena. Idealism\u2003 The theory that all concrete phenomena are funda- mentally mental. For example, on Berkeley\u2019s idealism, rocks are \u00adcomposed of ideas, such as the idea of solidity, the idea of having a certain shape, etc. Immaterial\u2003 Not made of matter. The claim that immaterial things exist is incompatible with physicalism. For example, according to Cartesian dualism, the mind is immaterial: it can exist without the body. See also substance dualism, extended substance. Individualism\u2003 see internalism. Infallible\u2003 Incapable of being incorrect. For example, according to Descartes, his knowledge of his own existence is infallible.",
