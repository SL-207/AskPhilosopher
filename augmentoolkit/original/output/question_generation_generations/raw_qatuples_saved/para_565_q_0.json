    "paragraph": " have been completed. Now imagine Mary, a brilliant scientist, 6 CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 32 who has never seen colors. She isn\u2019t colorblind. It\u2019s just that there were never any colors for her to see. She was raised in an entirely black- and-white room. Suppose her clothing is black and white too, that there aren\u2019t any mirrors, etc. Even so, Mary knows a lot about color vision. From a scientific perspective, she knows everything about it. Indeed, she knows the complete physical truth. She learns that truth by reading black-and-white books and watching lectures on a black- and-white television monitor. If that seems like a lot of information to master, well it is. But Mary is not just brilliant: she is a perfect reasoner. And she has plenty of time. After learning the complete physical truth, Mary is released from her room. She sees colors for the first time. Does she learn anything new? Intuitively, she does. She already knew the complete science of how the human vision system processes information about colors, and so she doesn\u2019t learn anything more about that. Even so, she learns something that she didn\u2019t previously know\u2014something that color- sighted people outside the room did know. She learns what it\u2019s like to see in color (see Chapters 4 and 5). The Mary case causes trouble for physicalism. According to physi- calism, all information is physical. That includes all information about color experiences. So, if physicalism is true, then, before leaving the room, Mary should know all there is to know about seeing in color. But she doesn\u2019t. At that point, she lacks information about what it\u2019s like to see in color. She doesn\u2019t acquire that information until she leaves. But that means the information she acquires cannot be physical information, since she has all that information in the room. And if her newly acquired information is not physical, then not all information is physical, and so physicalism is false.",
