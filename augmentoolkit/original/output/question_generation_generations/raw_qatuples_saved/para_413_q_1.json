    "paragraph": " The general idea with this response is that green is in some sense a feature of the world that is independent of us and our interests, but grue isn\u2019t. The response contends that it is only natural kind properties that can be projected. This same \u201cnatu- ral kinds\u201d response has been put forward as a solution to the Ravens Paradox as well (Quine 1969). According to this way of responding to the Ravens Paradox, the Nicod Condition is false. The response con- tends that it is only universal statements about natural kinds that are confirmed by their instances. Thus, this response yields the result that observing a black raven confirms \u201call ravens are black\u201d (because ravens and blackness are natural kinds), but a white piece of chalk doesn\u2019t confirm \u201call nonblack things are non-ravens\u201d (because nonblack and non-ravens aren\u2019t natural kinds). This move allows supporters of this response to deny the conclusion that observing a white piece of chalk confirms \u201call ravens are black\u201d. Perhaps the most common response to the Ravens Paradox is the Bayesian response (Maher 1999, Fitelson and Hawthorne 2010, \u00adRinard 2014). This sort of response makes use of Bayesian confirma- tion theory to make the conditions of confirmation more precise (we won\u2019t worry about the details of Bayesianism here). What is perhaps most interesting about this response is that, like the previous response, it involves a denial of the Nicod condition (though for different rea- sons than the natural kind response), but it embraces the conclusion Ravens Paradox 215 that observing a white piece of chalk confirms \u201call ravens are black\u201d. In order to make this conclusion less troubling, the Bayesian response insists that observing a white piece of chalk doesn\u2019t support \u201call ravens are black\u201d nearly as strongly as observing a black raven does. In fact, many Bayesians insist that the support that observing a white piece of chalk provides for \u201call ravens are black\u201d is extremely miniscule.",

    "question": "What is the \"Nicod Condition\", and why is it often denied in responses to the Ravens Paradox?",
    "answer": "The Nicod Condition is a statement that holds that observing an instance of a universal statement confirms that statement. However, responses to the Ravens Paradox often deny this condition, arguing that it is only universal statements about natural kinds that are confirmed by their instances.",
