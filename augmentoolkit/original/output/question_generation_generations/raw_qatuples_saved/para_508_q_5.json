    "paragraph": " Of course, one worry that immediately arises is why we should think that Aaliyah and the other students can\u2019t know that the professor\u2019s announcement is true. One way of insisting that the announce- ment cannot be known is by arguing that the announcement is a Moorean sentence (see Moore\u2019s Paradox pp. 235\u2013238) (Wright and \u00adSudbury 1977). Moorean sentences are things like \u201cit\u2019s raining, but I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s raining.\u201d Many think that even though such sentences express propositions that can be true, they can\u2019t be known to be true by the person uttering them. Similarly, some insist that the professor\u2019s announcement amounts to a Moorean sentence for the\u00a0\u00adstudents. As a result, Aaliyah and her\u00a0\u00adclassmates cannot know that the announcement is true. A related response doesn\u2019t claim that the professor\u2019s initial an- nouncement is a Moorean sentence, but instead contends that it becomes one at the end of class on Thursday (Olin 2003). The thinking here is that if class ends on Thursday and there hasn\u2019t been a quiz yet, Aaliyah (as well as the other students) can no longer know that the professor\u2019s announcement of a surprise quiz is true. This stops the first step in Aaliyah\u2019s argument. Here\u2019s the idea. \u00adAaliyah\u2019s knowledge that the professor\u2019s announcement is true is the basis for her knowing Thursday (after class ends) that there will be a sur- prise quiz on Friday. However, if Aaliyah were to know that there would be a surprise quiz on Friday, then the quiz wouldn\u2019t be a sur- prise. But this means that the professor\u2019s announcement is false\u2014so, \u00adAaliyah couldn\u2019t know the announcement is true. Hence, on this response, Aaliyah could know that the professor\u2019s announcement is true all week until the end of class on Thursday. At that point, Aal- iyah would no longer know that the announcement is true. Con- sequently, this response maintains that Aaliyah\u2019s initial step in her argument doesn\u2019t work.",
