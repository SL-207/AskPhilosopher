    "paragraph": " The general idea here is that green is in some sense a feature of the world that is inde- pendent of us and our interests, but grue isn\u2019t. The response contends that it is only natural kind properties that can be projected. A different way of responding insists that \u201cgreen\u201d is an observable predicate but \u201cgrue\u201d is not (Thomson 1966a, 1966b). The gist of this response is that you can tell simply by looking whether something is green or not\u2014if you\u2019re in the right lighting conditions, you simply look and can tell if it is green. However, the same isn\u2019t true when it comes to telling whether something is grue. In order to know if an object is grue, you must not only look at it, but you must also know when you are observing it. Yet another response contends that hypotheses employing \u201cgreen\u201d are simpler than those employing \u201cgrue\u201d because the former involve stable laws of nature, whereas the latter involve those that change. The thought here is that if in fact all emeralds are green, then whether we observe an emerald or not has no effect on its color. But if all emeralds are grue, then the actual appearance of the emerald will change depending upon whether it is observed before a particular time or not (Rheinwald 1993). A different sort of explanatory response argues that in some sense, \u201call emeralds are green\u201d better explains our observations than \u201call em- eralds are grue\u201d does (White 2005, Ward 2012). One way of cashing out this kind of response is to point out that any hypothesis, such as that all emeralds are grue, which holds that unobserved emeralds aren\u2019t green will have to include some condition that accounts for why we, for some reason, have only observed the emeralds that look green. This is a seemingly ad hoc addition that the hypothesis that all emeralds are green doesn\u2019t need in order to account for our obser- vations. As a result, the hypothesis that all emeralds are green offers a better explanation of the many observations of green (and only green) emeralds than the hypothesis that all emeralds are grue does.",

    "question": "What is the main advantage of the hypothesis that all emeralds are green over the hypothesis that all emeralds are grue?",
    "answer": "The hypothesis that all emeralds are green offers a better explanation of the many observations of green (and only green) emeralds because it doesn't need to include any additional conditions to account for why emeralds that are unobserved seem green.",
