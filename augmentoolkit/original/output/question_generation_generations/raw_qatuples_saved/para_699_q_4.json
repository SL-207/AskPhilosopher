    "paragraph": "\u201d Methodological behaviorism is a theory about how to study the mind scientifically: one should study the mind by studying behavior. Philosophical behaviorism is a theory about the nature of mental phenomena: mental phe- nomena are behavioral phenomena. Glossary 316 Blind spot\u2003 Area where a person\u2019s view is obstructed. Normally sighted humans have an anatomical blind spot corresponding to the place where the optic nerve is attached to the retina. Constitution\u2003 A thing\u2019s constitution is what makes it up. For exam- ple, a diamond is constituted by a lattice of carbon atoms; a statue is constituted by the clay from which it is made, perhaps together with certain other features, such as the clay\u2019s shape. Content\u2003 What is represented as being the case. For example, the content of the belief that Biden is the president of the United States in 2023 is the proposition that Biden is the president of the United States in 2023. One can hold different attitudes toward that same proposition. For example, one could not only believe that Biden is the president of the United States in 2023 but also desire that Biden is the president of the United States in 2023. See also proposition, propositional attitude. Contingent\u2003 A proposition is contingent if it need not have been the case. For example, the claim that all frogs are happy is \u00adcontingent. Even if all frogs happen to be happy, this is not a necessary truth; it might have been the case that not all frogs are happy. By \u00adcontrast, the claim that all frogs are frogs is necessary\u2014 that is, not contingent. Disposition\u2003 A tendency to do something or to behave in a certain way. For example, salt has the disposition to dissolve in water. Dualism\u2003 The theory that the mental and the physical are funda- mentally distinct. See also property dualism, substance dualism. Epiphenomenalism\u2003 The theory that mental states or proper- ties are by-products (effects) of physical phenomena but do not themselves have any effects on the physical world.",

    "question": "What is a contingent proposition, and can you give an example?",
    "answer": "A contingent proposition is one that need not have been the case. For example, the claim that all frogs are happy is contingent, as it might not have been the case that all frogs are happy, even if that happens to be true.",
