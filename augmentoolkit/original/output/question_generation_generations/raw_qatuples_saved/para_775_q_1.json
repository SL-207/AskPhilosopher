    "paragraph": " EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: EPISTEMIC JUSTIFICATION: EXTERNALISM VS. INTERNALISM; CLAIRVOYANCE CASES Ms. Cleo is a mostly normal adult except for one big thing\u2014she\u2019s psychic. That\u2019s right, she really has psychic powers. In particular, she is a reliable clairvoyant. Her faculty of clairvoyance tends to produce way more true beliefs than false beliefs. Ms. Cleo has no idea that she has this psychic power though. In other words, she doesn\u2019t believe that she\u2019s psychic, she has no memory of using this power in the past and being correct, and so on. Hence, she has no reason at all to think JUSTIFICATION 126 that she is psychic. However, unlike most everyone else, Ms. Cleo is also woefully uninformed about how unlikely it is for anyone to have psychic powers. As a result, Ms. Cleo doesn\u2019t have any reason to think that she, or anyone else, can\u2019t have psychic powers. Thus, Ms. Cleo has no reason one way or the other about her psychic powers. One day, a belief pops into her mind\u2014\u201cthe current mayor of New York City is visiting Los Angeles right now\u201d. Ms. Cleo has no evidence whatso- ever for or against this. Nonetheless, the belief is reliably produced\u2014it is the output of her reliable clairvoyant faculty. Why is this case important? It matters because intuitively Ms. Cleo shouldn\u2019t believe that the current mayor of New York City is visiting Los Angeles right now. It seems that her belief is entirely unreasona- ble. Yet, Ms. Cleo\u2019s belief is reliable. Consequently, this case illustrates a failure of simple reliabilism (or any reliabilist view that holds that reliability is sufficient for justification). Ms. Cleo has a belief that is reliable but unjustified. RESPONSES Most everyone (opponents and proponents of reliabilism) agrees that this sort of case shows that simple reliabilism fails. Opponents of relia- bilism take this to be yet another reason to reject reliabilist theories in general.",
