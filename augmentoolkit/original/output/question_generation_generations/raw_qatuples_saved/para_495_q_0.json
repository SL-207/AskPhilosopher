Yet, a seemingly impeccable line of reasoning yields the conclusion that there cannot be such a quiz. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: SURPRISE QUIZ PARADOX Aaliyah is a very clever student (as philosophy students tend to be) in an epistemology course that meets five days a week (Monday through Friday). One Friday, as class is finishing up Aaliyah\u2019s professor announces that there will be a surprise quiz someday next week. Aaliyah thinks for a few minutes; then right before class ends, she raises her hand. When the professor calls on her, Aaliyah tells the professor that there cannot be a surprise quiz next week. The professor knows that Aaliyah is a very conscientious student, but she can\u2019t think of anything that is coming next week so that class would need to be canceled or any other reason why the students couldn\u2019t have a quiz. So she asks Aaliyah to explain. Here\u2019s Aaliyah\u2019s response. The quiz can\u2019t be on Friday because if the class makes it to Thursday without a quiz, a quiz on Friday wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. So, the quiz can\u2019t be Friday. However, it can\u2019t be on PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 228 Thursday either. Why not? Well, Aaliyah explains that she knows that it isn\u2019t on Friday, so if the quiz hadn\u2019t occurred by the end of class on Wednesday, then she would know that it was on Thursday. But again this would mean that the quiz isn\u2019t a surprise. So, the quiz can\u2019t be on Thursday. Now, Aaliyah knows that it\u2019s not on Thursday or Friday. She says it can\u2019t be on Wednesday either. After all, since she knows it\u2019s not on Thursday or Friday, if the quiz hasn\u2019t been given by the end of class on Tuesday, then it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if it\u2019s on Wednesday. So the quiz can\u2019t be given on Wednesday.",

    "question": "A student is told that there will be a surprise quiz next week. How can the student prove that the quiz cannot be on Friday if the class makes it to Thursday without a quiz?",
    "answer": "The student can argue that if the class makes it to Thursday without a quiz, a quiz on Friday would not be a surprise. This is because the student would already know that there is no quiz on Friday, and a surprise quiz would require the student to be unaware of its schedule.",
