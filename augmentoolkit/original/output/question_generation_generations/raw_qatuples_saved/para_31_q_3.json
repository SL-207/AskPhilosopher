    "paragraph": " But how could that be if teleological theories are correct? Unlike Donald, Swampman has no evolutionary history. No aspect of Swampman\u2019s mental life can be correctly described as having co-\u00ad varied with encounters with green-colored objects (or with anything else). Factors that play a central role on teleological theories are ab- sent. So, it is hard to see how those theories could be correct. The Swampman case presents a similar challenge to a view about consciousness known as representationalism (also known as intentional- ism). Earlier we noted that, at least from a naturalistic perspective, it can seem mysterious how mental states can represent (or be about) anything. We also noted that teleological theories of content promise to dispel that mystery, explaining mental representation in natural- istic (e.g., causal/historical) terms. Some suggest that those theories can also dispel another widely discussed mystery: how to explain the phenomenal, or \u201cwhat it is like\u201d, aspect of conscious experience (Harman 1990, Dretske 1995, Tye 2000, Jackson 2003; and see Part I). These scholars\u2019 suggestion combines two ideas. The first is rep- resentationalism about phenomenal character, the view that a mental state\u2019s phenomenal character consists entirely in its representational character\u2014that is, in how that state represents the world (this can include both representational content and the way that content is rep- resented). The second is to apply teleological/co-variational theories to the representational character in which, according to representa- tionalism, phenomenal character consists. The idea here is to explain this representational character in terms of naturalistic considerations about teleology and co-variation. That suggestion might seem promising. Phenomenal character might not seem so baffling if it can be identified with a \u00adphenomenon that can be explained naturalistically.",

    "question": "What is the idea behind applying teleological/co-variational theories to the representational character of mental states?",
    "answer": "The idea is to identify the phenomenal character of a mental state with a phenomenon that can be explained naturalistically, by applying teleological/co-variational theories to the representational character of mental states. This would make the phenomenal character less mysterious and more understandable in naturalistic terms.",
