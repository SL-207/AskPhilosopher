DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-30 OTTO\u2019S NOTEBOOK BACKGROUND As we have seen in our discussion of Twin Earth and Arthritis Man (Chapter 25), philosophers who embrace externalism believe that our mental contents \u201cextend\u201d out into the world. According to exter- nalism, which mental contents we have depends constitutively on what physical and social environment we are in\u2014for example, whether the stuff that makes up our lakes and oceans is composed chemi- cally of H2O or some other chemical substance, such as XYZ. In the late 20th century, some philosophers began to embrace a more radical form of externalism on which the mental \u201cextends\u201d out into the world in a much stronger sense.",
