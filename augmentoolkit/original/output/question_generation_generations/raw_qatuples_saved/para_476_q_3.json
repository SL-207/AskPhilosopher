    "paragraph": " Given, however, that I have no duty to perform any particular supererogatory act as opposed to others, the choice of which such acts to perform is mine to make. Particular supererogatory acts would therefore on the view in question still differ Moral and Non-Moral Value 77 from particular acts it is my duty to perform. In the case of acts of the latter type the choice of whether to perform them is not mine to make, since were I to choose not to perform them I would fail to fulfill my duty and thus would act wrongly. Since I have no duty to perform any particular supererogatory act as opposed to others, the possible beneficiaries of such acts have no claim or right against me that I perform them, and I do not wrong them in not doing so. This brings us to the concept of moral rights. I have argued elsewhere3 in some detail for the view that to say that some moral agent, a, has a moral right to something, x, is to say ( 1 ) that a acts at least prima facie rightly in attempting to acquire or retain x and (2) that if any other moral agent, b, is in a position to affect a's acquisition or retention of x, then b has at least a prima f acie duty to act compatibly with a's acquiring or retaining x. Since beings that are not moral agents-such as dumb animals, fetuses, infants, small children, and severely retarded people-are incapable of acting rightly or wrongly in a moral sense, to say that such a being, a, has a moral right to some\u00ad thing, x, is to say only (2) abovew4 If in a given situation b's prima facie duty to act compatibly with a's acquiring or retaining something, x, to which a has a moral right, is not overridden by some conflicting weightier prima f acie duty or countered by some conflicting prima f acie duty of equal weight, then b has an absolute duty to act compatibly with a's acquiring or retaining x. In failing to fulfill this duty b not only acts wrongly but also wrongs a, especially if b attempts to prevent a from acquiring or retaining x, as distinguished from simply doing nothing to assist a in acquiring or retaining x.",

    "question": "Are non-moral agents (such as animals or people with severe developmental disabilities) capable of having moral rights?",
    "answer": "No, non-moral agents are incapable of acting rightly or wrongly in a moral sense, so for them to have a moral right to something means only that others have a prima facie duty to act compatibly with their acquiring or retaining the thing.",
