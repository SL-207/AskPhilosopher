    "paragraph": " The goodness or badness of particulars of both types is determined by the nature of the universals they exemplify, taken in conjunction with the nature of the kinds of which they are instances. The exemplification of a given universal by an instance of one kind might make it a good instance of its kind, whereas the exemplification of the same universal by an instance of another kind might make it a bad instance of that kind. It is argued that in at least some cases being a normal instance of xii Preface a given kind is sufficient to make an instance of the kind a good instance and that an instance of a kind can be a good instance without being an excellent one. This is followed by a discussion of virtues and vices, which are treated as good-making and bad-making properties of per\u00ad sons, and of loving and hating, the first of which is treated as a central virtue of persons, the second a central vice. It is then argued that the complete good of a person consists of two components-one a non\u00ad moral component consisting of having non-moral goods of various sorts, the other a moral component consisting of being morally good, which consists of having various of the mo\u0439al virtues in a degree suffi\u00ad cient to make one a good person. The seventh and eighth chapters are devoted to a discussion of the nature and value of practical rationality. In chapter 7 it is argued that such rationality takes precedence over theoretical rationality, given that the object of theoretical rationality-the acquisition of theoretical knowledge or understanding-is only one value among others. The argument includes a discussion of the difference between silence and deception and of the possibility of self-deception and an assessment of the relative value of silence, deception, and knowledge. In the eighth chapter the relationship of practical rationality to morality is discussed. Two views of practical rationality and morality are discussed, one of which is egoistic, the other non-egoistic.",
