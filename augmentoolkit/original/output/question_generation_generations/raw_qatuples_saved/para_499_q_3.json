    "paragraph": " But, as Burge (1982) ar- gues, Alfred could equally well be described as having the same belief content at both times, just applied (unwittingly) to two distinct apples. So, this case does not adequately establish externalism. Burge\u2019s argument for externalism is more subtle. He appeals to two thought experiments. One is Twin Earth, a case originally devised by Hilary Putnam (1975) for a related purpose (Putnam was concerned with the reference of terms, whereas Burge is concerned with the contents of mental states). The other is Burge\u2019s own (1979) arthritis case. THE CASES Putnam (1975) imagines a near duplicate of our planet Earth, which he calls Twin Earth. There is one key difference: on Twin Earth, the liquid that runs through the rivers and faucets, and which is called \u201cwater\u201d in the language some Twin Earth inhabitants call \u201cEnglish,\u201d is not H2O. Their liquid has an entirely different chemical composi- tion, XYZ\u2014where X, Y, and Z are elements not presently known to us. Putnam claims that the liquid on Twin Earth is not water, despite the superficial similarity it bears to water. Burge agrees: it is what we might call twin-water instead. Putnam\u2019s and Burge\u2019s view about water and \u201ctwater\u201d is widely shared. Water is a natural kind\u2014a kind found in nature, which was not human-made. The fundamental nature of such a natural kind is determined not by superficial qualities, such as how it appears to humans, but rather by the underlying, more basic features, such as chemical composition. Suppose Amari is an Earthling who doesn\u2019t know that water is H2O. Now consider her Twin Earth counterpart, AmariTE. Amari and \u00adAmariTE are duplicates in many respects. Their behavioral dispositions, Twin Earth and Arthritis Man 155 their inner functional states, and their qualitative conscious states are indistinguishable. They are also physically indistinguishable, save for the fact that Amari\u2019s body contains water and AmariTE\u2019s contains twin-water.",

    "answer": "The only difference between Amari and AmariTE, apart from the substance they contain, is that Amari's body contains water (H2O) and AmariTE's body contains twin-water (XYZ).",
