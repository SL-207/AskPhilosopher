The general idea is that it seems that various non-evidential factors can change how things seem to us. For in- stance, if we are really angry, someone\u2019s facial expression might seem hostile, whereas if we weren\u2019t angry, that same expression might seem neutral. Some argue that the possibility of cognitive penetration poses a serious prob- lem for phenomenal conservatism because it suggests that not all seemings provide justification.",

    "question": "Does the idea of cognitive penetration pose a problem for a particular philosophical theory?",
    "answer": "Yes, the idea of cognitive penetration poses a serious problem for phenomenal conservatism, which is a philosophical theory that suggests that seemings provide justification.",
