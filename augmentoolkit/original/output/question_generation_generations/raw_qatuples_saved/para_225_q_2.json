    "paragraph": " On this strategy, dualism is built into our concepts; but that is perfectly consistent with a \u00adphysicalist view about what our concepts pick out. Non-\u00adphysicalists counter that this strategy doesn\u2019t succeed. It merely relocates the \u00adproblem the \u00adzombie case brings out. If phenomenal concepts are \u00adreally so \u00addistinctive\u2014if their features can explain the ideal \u00adconceivability of a zombie world\u2014then those concepts will themselves be \u00adnon-\u00adphysical, and so the anti-physicalist argument can be reinstated (Chalmers 2007; for further discussion, see Balog 2012, Alter 2023).

    "question": "What is the zombie case and what does it have to do with the anti-physicalist argument?",
    "answer": "The zombie case refers to the idea of a world in which all the physical processes in a person's brain are replicated, but there is no subjective experience or consciousness. The zombie case is used to argue against physicalism, as it suggests that subjective experience cannot be reduced to purely physical processes. Non-physicalists argue that the zombie case shows that our concepts of consciousness and subjective experience cannot be explained purely in terms of physical processes.",
