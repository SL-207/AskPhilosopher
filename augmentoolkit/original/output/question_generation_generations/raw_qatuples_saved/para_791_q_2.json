    "paragraph": " In one influential effort to overthrow Cartesian- ism, Gilbert Ryle (1949) advanced a behavioristic theory of mind that eliminated mental images entirely. Toward this end, he developed an analysis of imagination that takes it to be identical with pretending, an activity that can be understood non-imagistically. On Ryle\u2019s view, to imagine a triangle is to pretend to see a triangle; and to imagine a world containing philosophical zombies is just to pretend that a world of philosophical zombies exists (see Chapter 7). Though behaviorism is no longer a popular view among philos- ophers, the imagery-based view of imagination has not returned to its former dominance. Even philosophers who are perfectly willing to countenance the existence of mental imagery deny that it is an essential component of imagining, and it is commonly accepted that imagining can occur without imagery (see, e.g., Walton 1990, White 1990, Van Leeuwen 2013). Motivating this view are two broad classes of examples. First, there are cases of imaginings where it\u2019s hard to see how imagery could play a role. For example, someone who is reading Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings might imagine that elves live forever. But, as Neil Van Leeuwen claims, this proposition can\u2019t be imagined using PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 198 mental imagery; in his words, \u201cIt would take too long!\u201d (2013, p. 222). Second, there are cases of imaginings where it\u2019s hard to see how im- agery could distinguish one imagining from another. Consider, for example, a case where we imagine a young child emerging from the ocean and scrambling up the shore. How could a mental image dif- ferentiate this from where it\u2019s the young child\u2019s identical twin who is emerging from the ocean (White 1990)? In response to these kinds of cases, proponents of an imagery-based account of imagining note that the cases only seem to raise worries because of overly demanding conceptions of the role that imagery would have to play in imagining.",

    "answer": "The two broad classes of examples motivating this view are cases of imaginings where it's hard to see how imagery could play a role, and cases of imaginings where it's hard to see how imagery could distinguish one imagining from another.",
