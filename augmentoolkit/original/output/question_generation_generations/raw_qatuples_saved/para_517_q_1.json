Attitudes toward the Indifferent 1 87 4. Instances, Kinds, and Value The preceding means that it is possible for a person ( 1) to like some\u00ad thing, a, more than something else, b,. as an instance of one kind, (2) to like b but not a as an instance of another kind, and ( 3) to like b on the whole or simpliciter more than a regardless of their being instances of certain kinds. Thus the widow might like the necklace more than the bauble as an aesthetic object, like the bauble but not the necklace as a token of her husband's love, and like the bauble on the whole more than the necklace. It is also possible ( 1) for one thing, a, to have greater value of one kind than another, b, (2) for b but not a to have value of another kind, and (3) for either of the two, a or b, to have greater value on the whole than the other. Thus ( 1) the necklace might have greater aesthetic value than the bauble, (2) the bauble but not the necklace might have what may be referred to as \"sentimental\" value, at least for the widow, and (3) either of the two, the necklace or the bauble, might have greater value on the whole than the other. It is possible also for a person ( 1) to like one thing, a, more than another, b, as an instance of one kind, (2) to like b but not a as an instanc'e of another kind, ( 3) to like something else, c, simply for itself alone and not as being an instance of some kind, and ( 4) to like c more than a or b. Thus the widow might ( 1) like the necklace more than the bauble as an aesthetic object, (2) like the bauble but not the necklace as a token of her husband's love, ( 3) like her hus\u00ad band's having loved her for itself alone and not as being an instance of some kind, and ( 4) like her husband's having loved her more than either the necklace or the bauble.",

    "question": "What is the difference between liking something as an instance of a certain kind and liking it simply for itself alone?",
    "answer": "Liking something as an instance of a certain kind means that you like it because of its particular qualities or characteristics that fit into a certain category. Liking something simply for itself alone means that you like it for its own sake, without considering its qualities or characteristics in relation to any particular category.",
