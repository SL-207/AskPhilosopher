    "paragraph": " Realization\u2003 How a feature is implemented or constituted. For \u00adexample, consider the feature being a hammer. That feature can be realized by an object made of metal and wood. It can also be \u00adrealized by an object made of plastic. Likewise, on some philo- sophical theories, the feature pain can be experienced by creatures with biological brains such as ours and by creatures with non-\u00ad biological \u201cbrains,\u201d such as robots. Reducible\u2003 Minimally, the relationship that holds between two fea- tures A and B when A is nothing more than B. Usually the term Glossary 322 \u201creducible\u201d implies something stronger than the \u201cnothing more than\u201d relation. For example, the claim that mental properties are reducible to physical properties often means that every mental property is identical to a physical property, such as a specific sort of neutral property. See also constitution. Representation\u2003 see content. Representationalism\u2003 The theory that phenomenal properties are just representational properties\u2014that is, properties of represent- ing that something is the case. For example, according to this the- ory, the property of being phenomenally red is just the property of representing something, in a certain way, as being red. See also content. Self-awareness\u2003 Awareness of oneself. Many philosophers have held that each of us is aware of oneself, and/or one\u2019s own mental states, in a distinctive way. For example, according to this theory, I am aware of my own existence, and of the contents of my mind, in a far more direct way, and with far more justification, than you are aware of those things. Structural truths\u2003 Truths that concern how things relate to one another, as opposed to how things are in themselves. According to some philosophers, the truths in theoretical physics are structural. That is because those truths concern abstract relations among entities that are themselves described in terms of how they in- teract with each other.",

    "question": "What is the theory that phenomenal properties are just representational properties?",
    "answer": "This theory is called representationalism, which posits that phenomenal properties, such as the experience of being red, are equivalent to representational properties, or properties of representing something as being red.",
