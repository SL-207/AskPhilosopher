    "paragraph": " This is a version of what is known as the combination problem (Seager 1995). A number of solutions have been proposed for this combination problem. According to one, just because some subjects don\u2019t combine in certain ways doesn\u2019t mean that no subjects, including those on the micro-level, can combine. True, you don\u2019t get a single mind by lining up a group of people thinking about letters of the alphabet. But it doesn\u2019t follow that there is no way to combine subjects. It is possible, for example, that some fundamental physical relations are such that, when two micro-subjects stand in those relations, they compose a further subject that contains the conscious states of both. It\u2019s also an option to deny James\u2019 intuition. The 26 subjects do compose a further subject, and it only appears otherwise because none of us are that subject; we just don\u2019t have access to the combined experience. The 27th subject is itself not likely to be integrated enough to do complex tasks like survey its own experiences and report on them, so there is a difference between subjects 1\u201326 and the 27th subject. But it is a difference in degree, not a difference in kind. RECOMMENDED READING CANONICAL PRESENTATION James, William. 1890. The Principles of Psychology, Vol. 1. London: Dover: 158\u201362.
