    "paragraph": " From the preceding several consequences follow. One is that in order that one of two things have greater value than the other it is not neces\u00ad sary that they both be instances of the same kind. Thus although a might have greater value than b as an instance of the kind, k, c, which is not an instance of that kind, might have greater value than either a or b. If so, then an instance of one kind can have greater value than an instance of some other kind. This, however, does not mean that c has greater value than any instance of the kind, k, nor does it mean that any other instance of the same kind as c has greater value than any instance of the kind k. Instead, some instances of one kind can have greater value than some instances of a second kind and vice versa. Moreover, in order that this be the case it is not necessary that the value of the instances of these different kinds differ in kind. Thus the aesthetic value of a musical 1 88 The Nature of Value performance of one kind, such as a country, jazz, or rock performance, might be greater than that of another kind, such as a performance of a classical symphony, even though most performances of the latter kind have greater aesthetic value than most of the former kinds. This, how\u00ad ever, does not mean that one kind cannot have greater value than another. Thus the kind having performances of classical symphonies as its instances might have greater aesthetic value than any of the kinds having country, jazz, or rock performances as their instances. The first kind, however, can have greater aesthetic value than any of the latter kinds only if most performances of classical symphonies have greater value than most country, jazz, or rock performances. It is the value of the instances of a kind that determines the value of their kind, not vice versa. A second consequence, connected with the first, is that the value of an instance of a kind is not determined simply by the kind of which it is an instance.",

    "question": "What determines the value of a kind?",
    "answer": "The value of a kind is determined by the value of its instances. This means that a kind's value is ultimately determined by the value of the individual instances that make up that kind.",
