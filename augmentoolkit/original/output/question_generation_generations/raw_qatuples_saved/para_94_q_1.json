    "paragraph": " EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE; GETTIER PROBLEM In a rural portion of the U.S. Midwest there is a county that is known for its rolling hills and beautiful barns, let\u2019s call it \u201cBarn County\u201d. In fact, Barn County\u2019s income is greatly supplemented by the many visitors who come to drive on the winding roads and gaze at the lovely barns. Unfortunately, being located in the Midwest severe storms and torna- dos are a genuine threat to Barn County. This year just a few weeks before tourist season was set to begin, a bad tornado ripped through the county and destroyed almost all of the barns. The citizens were rightly distraught\u2014no one would want to visit Barn County without its barns! There wasn\u2019t enough time to rebuild the barns before tourist season, and half-built barns won\u2019t attract tourists. So, the people of Barn County came up with an idea. They would build barn fa\u00e7ades before tourist season; that way people would still come to look at the barns and Barn County would have the revenue to rebuild its barns. These barn fa\u00e7ades are like stage props\u2014they are a single side of a barn propped up so that from the road (where tourists drive) they are indistinguishable from real barns. Of course, the citizens of Barn County are keeping this ruse a secret from everyone\u2014we\u2019re the only people outside of Barn County to know this information. After all, barn enthusiasts have no interest in coming to see barn fa\u00e7ades; they want the real thing. Martha has decided to take a little vacation to celebrate a recent promotion. Being the barn lover that she is, Martha decides to take a trip to Barn County. Martha is blissfully unaware of the situation in Barn County. Martha is currently driving all over Barn County gazing at what she thinks are real barns. She says to herself (and believes) as she is looking at barn fa\u00e7ades: \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely barn!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s another one!\u201d \u201cAnd, another!",
