    "paragraph": " If he respects the kind of person he believes he is, he has ( or at least can have) self-respect. If he comes to believe that he is not the kind of person he respects he thereby loses, at least to some degree, his self-respect. 106 The Nature of Value Although, then, I can endeavor to hide my vices from others without believing that I am bad in the degree to which I have them or, indeed, without even believing that what I am attempting to hide from others are in fact vices, i.e., bad-making properties of a person, I cannot endeavor to hide them from myself unless I believe that they are such properties and that I am bad to the degree to which I have them. I can strive to hide from others my having what they regard as vices, regard\u00ad less of whether I too regard them as such, because I fear the conse\u00ad quences of their coming to believe that I have them. But I cannot strive to hide them from myself for this reason. 'Nor can I endeavor to hide them from myself, in order to escape suffering the remorse or loss of self-respect that I believe would result from acknowledging that I have them, unless I believe that they are in fact bad-making properties of a person. I cannot, that is, suffer remorse or a loss of self-respect from admitting that I have certain defects of character unless I believe that they are indeed defects of character. Thus although I might not recog\u00ad nize that I am doing so, I pay an even higher compliment to the virtues in attempting to hide my vices from myself that I do in endeavoring to hide them from others. Such attempts at self-deception therefore neces\u00ad sarily honor various of the virtues, whereas attempts at deceiving others might or might not do so, depending upon the motives animating such attempts. To say, however, that attempts at self-deception necessarily involve a kind of homage to the virtues, and that attempts to deceive others might also involve such homage, is to tell only one side of the story.",

    "question": "Can attempts at self-deception also involve honoring the virtues?",
    "answer": "Yes, attempts at self-deception can also involve honoring the virtues, as they show a level of self-awareness and recognition of one's flaws or defects of character.",
