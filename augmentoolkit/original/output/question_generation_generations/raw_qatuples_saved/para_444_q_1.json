    "paragraph": " For example, consider Jones\u2019s belief that grass is green. Her belief is about grass and about being green. It also represents a proposition: the prop- osition that grass is green. That proposition is the representational content of her belief, in that her belief is true if and only if grass is, in fact, green. Why do mental states have the representational content they have? Why do they have representational content at all? This can seem mysterious, especially from a naturalistic perspective on which mental states are parts of the natural, physical world. For example, considered as a physical object, a photograph is nothing more than an arrangement of molecules, and molecules do not appear to be about anything. And, from a naturalistic perspective, the same would seem to be true of mental states. Teleological theories of content aim to \u00addispel that mystery by showing how mental content derives from non-\u00ad mental aspects of nature. According to such theories, mental content depends at least partly on functions of the things (or systems) that use or produce those contents. And such functions are usually understood in terms of natural selection (or a related process), roughly as what 24 Swampman 147 the thing in question was selected for. A classic source for this sort of view is Ruth Millikan\u2019s Language, Thought and Other Biological Cate- gories (1984). One consequence of Millikan\u2019s view is that a subject\u2019s mental content depends on their evolutionary history. But what if a creature has no evolutionary history? Could it have mental contents? If so, how? And what would determine which contents they have? THE CASE Donald is an ordinary human being. Or rather, he was until one fate- ful day, when he was visiting a swamp that was struck by lightning. The lightning simultaneously caused two things to happen. It vapor- ized Donald\u2019s body and it transformed a nearby dead tree into an ex- act replica of him, known as Swampman.",

    "question": "What are teleological theories of content, and how do they attempt to explain the representational content of mental states?",
    "answer": "Teleological theories of content attempt to dispel the mystery of mental content by showing how mental content derives from non-mental aspects of nature. They suggest that mental content depends partly on functions of the things or systems that use or produce those contents, which are usually understood in terms of natural selection or a related process.",
