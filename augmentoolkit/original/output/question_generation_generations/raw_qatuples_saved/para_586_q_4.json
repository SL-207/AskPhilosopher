    "paragraph": " In response, knowledge argument propo- nents argue that knowing what it\u2019s like can\u2019t plausibly be reduced to possessing abilities\u2014or that if it can, then those abilities can\u2019t be possessed without possessing information (Conee 1994, Coleman 2009, Alter 2023). Fourth, some argue that the Mary case shows something about our concepts of experience but nothing about the nature of experiences (Loar 1997, Balog 1999, Montero 2007; see Chapter 8). Seeing color doesn\u2019t give Mary any new information, but rather provides her with new conceptual resources. This is known as the phenomenal concept strat- egy (see Chapters 7 and 8). In response, knowledge argument propo- nents argue that the phenomenal concept strategy doesn\u2019t really solve the problem; it just moves the bump under the rug, so to speak. For example, consider Mary shortly after she leaves the room and has seen some red tomatoes. She knows what it\u2019s like to see red and green, and she possesses the associated phenomenal concepts. She might still wonder about other creatures\u2019 experiences. Even given a complete physical description of bats (or Martians), Mary might not be able to figure out if they have what she\u2019d describe as red experiences or green experiences (Chalmers 2004). In a historical twist, in the late 1990s, Jackson himself came to reject his knowledge argument and embrace physicalism. He now attributes the intuition that Mary gains information when she leaves the room primarily to a failure to recognize that to experience color is to repre- sent the world in a distinctive way\u2014a way that can be explained in en- tirely physical terms (Jackson 2003). He grants that Mary\u2019s pre-release Mary and the Black-and-White Room 35 knowledge of what it\u2019s like to see in color is incomplete. But, in his view, that is only because possessing such knowledge requires possess- ing certain abilities, such as the ability to visualize in color\u2014a fact that is perfectly consistent with the physicalist claim that all information is physical information.",
