    "paragraph": " Both Inga and Otto want to go to the Museum. They also both believe that the Museum is on 53rd street. It\u2019s precisely because of this belief\u2013desire pair that they each head in the relevant direction. But when did they acquire the belief about the location of the Museum? With respect to Inga, the answer seems straightforward. She already had this belief prior to consulting her memory. The belief was not occurrent: she was not at that moment consciously thinking about its content. But at any given moment most of our beliefs are not occur- rent. Presumably, most readers of this book have beliefs about who the current President of the United States is, or what city is the capital of France, or what kind of animal Dumbo is. But those beliefs were presumably not occurrent until you were prompted to call them to mind by reading this paragraph. Most of our beliefs remain stored in memory until they need to be accessed. They are standing beliefs. This is exactly how we would most naturally describe Inga\u2019s belief about the location of MoMA. Otto\u2019s Notebook 163 What about Otto? The process he goes through is, in most respects, exactly the same as Inga\u2019s. So, if we\u2019re prepared to grant that Inga be- lieved that the Museum is on 53rd Street even before she consults her memory, why wouldn\u2019t we be prepared to grant that Otto believed that the Museum is on 53rd Street even before he consults his notebook? Sure, his belief wasn\u2019t occurrent at the time; but neither was Inga\u2019s. As Clark and Chalmers argue, the difference between Inga and Otto is not whether they had the belief, but in whether that belief is stored within the confines of skull and skin. Though Inga\u2019s beliefs are stored internally (note the \u201cin\u201d in \u201cInga\u201d), Otto offloads his beliefs to external storage. Why should the location matter? The information that Inga stores in biological memory plays the same role for her that the information that Otto stores in his notebook plays for him.",

    "answer": "You would naturally describe most people's stored beliefs as \"standing beliefs\". This means that they remain stored in memory until they need to be accessed.",
