    "paragraph": " If, however, it can be good to like, to dislike, or to be indifferent toward an indifferent thing, a person who takes one of these attitudes toward a given indifferent thing cannot rightly condemn another for taking some contrary attitude toward it nor can he rightly expect that everyone else who has experience or knowledge of it take toward it the same attitude he takes. This is one of the major respects in which indif\u00ad ferent things differ from good and bad things. If a thing is good, then those who have experience of it can rightly be expected to like it and not to dislike or to be indifferent toward it; and if a thing is bad, then those who have experience or knowledge of it can rightly be expected to dis\u00ad like it and not to like or to be indifferent toward it. If, however, a thing is indifferent, those who take any of the three possible attitudes toward it are required to take an attitude of tolerance toward those who take some contrary attitude toward it. Such an attitude consists of neither expecting others to take the same attitude toward it nor condemning them for taking a different attitude. Thus if, as subjectivists in value theory claim, nothing were intrinsically good or bad, far greater toler\u00ad ance would be required of us than if some things are intrinsically good and others bad. If, however, the tolerance that would be required of us if nothing were intrinsically good or bad is itself intrinsically good and its absence bad, then it would be false that nothing is intrinsically good or bad, since then such tolerance would itself be intrinsically good and its absence bad. The proponent of the individualistic version of the moderate view might also go further and maintain not only that it can be good to like some indifferent things and dislike others but also that it can be better to like some indifferent things even more than one likes some good things and to dislike other indifferent things even more than one dis\u00ad likes some bad things.",

    "answer": "A person who takes a certain attitude towards an indifferent thing (liking, disliking, or being indifferent) cannot rightly expect others to have the same attitude towards it, nor can they rightly condemn others for having a different attitude.",
