    "paragraph": " When he finishes his workout at 6 am he feels hot and is considering his feeling. Barry is in a unique situation though. He has been asked to participate in a trial for a new relaxation room at the gym. This room allows one to very gradually cool off during a specific amount of time. Since Barry is part of the trial, he has agreed to stay in the room until noon. Throughout his time in the room, how warm he feels continually changes by the minutest amount every millisecond. By the end of his time in the room, Barry no longer feels hot\u2014in fact, he feels down- right cold! So, at the beginning of the process Barry feels hot and knows it, and at the end of the process Barry feels cold and knows it. Is Barry in a position to know whether he is hot at every point throughout this process? It doesn\u2019t seem so. After all, the changes from millisecond to millisecond are extremely small. Plausibly, there will be a point at which Barry transitions from feeling hot to not feeling hot, but the difference between the two will be imperceptible. The changes that Barry experiences are happening every millisecond. Given this, there will be a point at which Barry is at the bare minimum of feeling hot one moment and the very next millisecond he has transitioned to as close to feeling hot as he can be without actually feeling hot. It seems that at this transition Barry won\u2019t be able to tell the difference. The same seems true when we consider Barry\u2019s transition from feeling com- fortable (the stage after feeling hot) to feeling cold. There will be a point at which Barry has reached the limit for feeling comfortable and the next millisecond a minute change will make it so that Barry feels cold. Why does this matter? Well, if Barry\u2019s mental states are luminous, then at any point he is in a particular state, such as feeling hot or cold, he is in a position to know that he is in that state. However, many epistemologists accept that in order for someone to know that p in a particular circumstance, C, it has to be the case that in every situation that is sufficiently similar to C, the person wouldn\u2019t falsely believe that p.",

    "question": "Can Barry know whether he is hot at every point throughout the process where he is gradually cooled off?",
    "answer": "No, Barry is unlikely to be in a position to know whether he is hot at every point throughout the process. As the changes in his temperature are extremely small and happen millisecond by millisecond, there will be a point at which the difference between feeling hot and not feeling hot becomes imperceptible. At this point, Barry may not be able to tell the difference, suggesting that he is not in a position to know whether he is hot.",
