    "paragraph": " We might put this skeptical concern more formally: 1) You don\u2019t know that you\u2019re not dreaming. 2) If you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re not dreaming, then you don\u2019t know anything about the world around you. 3) Therefore, you don\u2019t know anything about the world around you. RESPONSES The argument for skepticism that the dreaming scenario helps gener- ate is very similar to the argument of the previous entry (see Descartes\u2019 Demon pp. 55\u201360). It is perhaps unsurprising that many epistemol- ogists treat the challenge posed by Descartes\u2019 dream as the same as the challenge posed by Descartes\u2019 demon. The general thought is that both possibilities threaten our knowledge of the world around us by offering a potential explanation of how we have all of the same expe- riences without actually interacting with the world around us in the way we think we do. Consequently, the same responses considered in the previous entry tend to be leveled at the skeptical argument arising from consideration of Descartes\u2019 dream. Nevertheless, some insist that the threat posed by dreaming skepti- cism is importantly different from that posed by demon-style skepti- cism (Sosa 2007, Beebe 2017). The thought here is that when you are a victim of Descartes\u2019 demon, you might be tricked into thinking that there\u2019s a book in your hand right now even though there is no book. Descartes\u2019 demon and other skeptical scenarios depend upon some sort of deception\u2014it seems that p is true (that you\u2019re holding a book, say), but p is false (you\u2019re not holding a book). The sort of skeptical challenge posed by the possibility of your dreaming seems different. After all, it could be that you in fact are holding a book in your hand while you are dreaming that you are. In this case, p seems true and it is true, and yet your ability to know has been undermined. Consider- ation of this difference between the two sorts of skeptical scenarios leads some to conclude that even if we can use the same responses to both sorts of skeptical arguments, the dreaming possibility teaches us LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 64 something very important about how skeptical arguments work\u2014 they don\u2019t have to present a scenario where our beliefs are false in order to undermine our knowledge.",

    "question": "What is the skeptical concern that is being expressed in the text, and can it be put into three formal steps?",
    "answer": "Yes, the skeptical concern can be put into three formal steps:\n\n1) You don\u2019t know that you\u2019re not dreaming.\n2) If you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re not dreaming, then you don\u2019t know anything about the world around you.\n3) Therefore, you don\u2019t know anything about the world around you.",
