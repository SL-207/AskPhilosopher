    "paragraph": " There are also times when things work out the other way though. It is possible to realize that one has more reason to believe something than one originally thought as one goes through the process of justifying the belief. Once we realize that justifying can help reveal whether we have good reasons to believe as we do, it can be easy to mistake justifying for having justification. But, we must avoid the mistake of thinking that one\u2019s belief isn\u2019t justified unless one can justify it. For one thing, someone can be justified in believing something even if they can- not justify that belief. For instance, young children have a number of 115 JUSTIFICATION justified beliefs (they may recognize various colors, what their favorite stuffed animal is, etc.). Yet, young children are apt to lack the sort of cognitive development needed to adequately justify their beliefs to someone else. For another thing, the act of attempting to justify a belief might itself generate new justification for believing something. It is possible that Kari believes that p despite lacking sufficient justifi- cation, but while attempting to justify her belief that p, she comes up with what are in fact very good reasons to believe that p. Prior to her attempt at justifying her belief that p, Kari didn\u2019t have sufficient justi- fication to believe that p. Nevertheless, her act of justifying her belief actually generated justification for her to believe that p. Throughout our discussions, we are concerned with justification rather than the act of justifying because it is the former that is necessary for knowl- edge and of most interest to epistemologists. TWO DEBATES Before concluding our general discussion of the nature of justifica- tion, it is important to get a handle on two of the central debates concerning the nature of justification. The first concerns the structure of justification and the second is the internalism/externalism debate.",

    "question": "What is the primary focus of epistemologists, and why is it more important than the act of justifying a belief?",
    "answer": "The primary focus of epistemologists is justification rather than the act of justifying. Justification is necessary for knowledge, and it is of most interest to epistemologists because it is the foundation of knowledge and understanding.",
