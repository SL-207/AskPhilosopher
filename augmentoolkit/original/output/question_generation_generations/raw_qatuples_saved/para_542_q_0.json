    "paragraph": " One way of making this response contends that any true proposition that isn\u2019t provably inconsistent is knowable (Tennant 1997). Another way of making this response limits PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 234 the idea that all truths are knowable to \u201cbasic\u201d statements (Dummett 2001). Roughly, the idea is that compound propositions do not fall under the requirement of being knowable in order to be true; rather, only the simple propositions that make up these compounds do. Both of these options would rule out \u201cUNKNOWN is true and not known\u201d from counting as knowable. RECOMMENDED READING GENERAL OVERVIEWS Epistemic Paradoxes.
