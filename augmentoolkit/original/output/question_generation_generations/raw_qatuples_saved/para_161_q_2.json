    "paragraph": " Everyone will agree that attempts to deceive others are frequently suc\u00ad cessful, and there is also no difficulty in understanding what must be done in situations of various sorts if oi;e is to succeed in deceiving others. Many will also agree that attempts at self-deception are also sometimes successful. How they succeed, however, is not always easily understandable, and it is perhaps the difficulty of understanding how they succeed that inclines some people to deny, or at least to doubt, that they ever do succeed. Yet they do sometimes seem to succeed, even though how some such attempts succeed might well seem to be ulti\u00ad mately incomprehensible. One can, however, give certain simple general rules that, if followed faithfully, might be of some slight assistance in helping those who want to deceive themselves to succeed in doing so. Thus if you want to believe that a certain proposition p is true, and if you want so much to believe that it is true that you are willing to endeavor to deceive yourself into believing that it is, then ( 1) do your best to discover whatever evidence there might be, regardless of how\u00ad ever slight its evidential value might be, for the truth of p, (2) do your best to avoid whatever evidence there might be that might lead you to doubt the truth of p, and (3) do your best to ignore whatever evidence you might happen to come across, regardless of however great its evi\u00ad dential value might be, that might lead you to doubt the truth of p. There are doubtless other rules of self-deception that would be of some assistance. Perhaps, however, all such more or less specific rules would be covered by the general rule directing that you violate as much as you can those rules that have generally been helpful in directing inquiry aimed at the acquisition of knowledge and understanding. Since, how\u00ad ever, you do not want to deceive yourself about everything, violate these rules only when you do want to deceive yourself about something and observe them when what you seek is knowledge and understanding.",

    "question": "Why might you want to follow the rules of self-deception, and what is the potential cost of doing so?",
    "answer": "You might want to follow the rules of self-deception if you want to believe something strongly and are willing to try to deceive yourself into believing it. However, following these rules can come at a cost, as it may involve violating the rules that have generally been helpful in directing inquiry aimed at acquiring knowledge and understanding. By doing so, you may compromise your ability to seek knowledge and understanding, and may end up with a distorted view of reality.",
