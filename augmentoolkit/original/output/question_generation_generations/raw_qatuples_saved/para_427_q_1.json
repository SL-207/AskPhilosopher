Even when it comes to things that we know to be true; it is widely agreed that we should keep an open mind when it comes to the opinions of others and be willing to consider new evidence. Nevertheless, it seems that some intuitively plausible principles about knowledge and evidence lead to the conclusion that we should sometimes be dogmatic. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: DEFEAT; MISLEADING EVIDENCE Here\u2019s something that is clearly true: if a proposition, p, is true, then any evidence that p is false is misleading evidence. After all, it is evidence that wrongly suggests that something true is not true. For example, the Chicago Bears won Super Bowl XX in 1986. If you come across an article that says that some other team won the Super Bowl in 1986, that article is mistaken and the evidence it provides is misleading. Here\u2019s something else that seems clearly true: if you know that some bit of evidence is misleading, you can (and should) disregard it.",
