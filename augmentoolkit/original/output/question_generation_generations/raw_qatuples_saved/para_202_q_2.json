    "paragraph": ") In responding to the exclusion problem, the dualist needs to take a different tack from that of the non-reductive physicalist. For, while the non-reductive physicalist can appeal to the intimate relation of realization or constitution between the mental and the physical to downplay the novelty (or the competition) of the causal contribution of the mental, the dualist has no such recourse. Take the property du- alist as an example\u2014though similar problems face substance dualists. If pains are wholly metaphysically distinct from the physical, being neither constituted nor necessitated by the physical, then it seems that any causal contribution they make must be novel. This novel contri- bution would then seem to compete with the physical. The property dualist thus faces a choice about which of two bullets to bite. One option would be to see the mental cause as making something happen that the physical did not make happen. In this case, however, they have to deny the completeness of physics. The other option would be to see the mental cause as being redundant, overdetermining an effect already determined by the physical. Some property dualists have taken the first option (Kane 1996, Stapp 2005): they deny the completeness of the physical and insist that some physical events need non-physical explanations. Notice that this is more than saying that some physical events lack physical expla- nations. At least on some interpretations of quantum mechanics, noth- ing fully explains the decay of a radium atom, for example. Still, that\u2019s a far cry from saying that something mental does determine it. The problem is that such quantum indeterminacy is everywhere (assuming it is anywhere) and not just in the vicinity of human minds. If this is where mental causation gets its grip, we should expect to see different quantum behavior in places where there are minds. But there\u2019s not much evidence for this.",

    "question": "What is the difference between saying that some physical events lack physical explanations and saying that something mental determines them?",
    "answer": "Saying that some physical events lack physical explanations implies that there is no known explanation for them, whereas saying that something mental determines them implies a specific causal relationship between the mental and the physical.",
