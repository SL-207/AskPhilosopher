    "paragraph": " Dennett is skeptical about that claim. Suppose we play a trick on Mary. When she leaves the room, we hand her a banana that has been painted blue. Would she be fooled into thinking \u201cAha! That\u2019s what it\u2019s like to see yel- low!\u201d? Not necessarily. She\u2019s a brilliant scientist, and so, before rushing to judgment, she might check. For example, she could study the surface features of the blue banana, including all its microphysical properties, and deduce what frequency of electromagnetic radiation the banana would reflect, and how humans typically react when seeing that frequency. She\u2019d thereby realize that this particular banana is blue\u2014and thus that her experience of seeing it doesn\u2019t reveal to her what it\u2019s like to see yel- low. In response, some knowledge argument proponents point out that Dennett\u2019s question about whether Mary is being fooled by the blue-\u00ad banana trick misses the point. Seeing the banana would provide Mary with phenomenal information, regardless of whether that information is associated with bananas or the term \u201cyellow\u201d\u2014information that she did not know before leaving the room. And that is all that is needed for the knowledge argument to go through (Nida-R\u00fcmelin 1995). CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 34 A third response relies on the distinction between different kinds of knowledge: knowledge-that (as when I know that riding a bike re- quires pedaling) and know-how (as when I know how to ride a bike). Philosophers offering this kind of response accept that Mary learns what it\u2019s like to see in color when she leaves the black-and-white room, but argue that she doesn\u2019t thereby gain information. They argue that to know what an experience is like is not to possess infor- mation (it\u2019s not knowledge-that). It\u2019s some other sort of knowledge (know-how), such as having the ability to imagine the experience (Lewis 1998, Nemirow 1990). And though physicalism might en- tail that, before leaving the room, Mary knows all information about color experiences, physicalism does not entail anything about what she can or can\u2019t imagine.",

    "question": "If you were to trick Mary into thinking she was seeing yellow by giving her a blue banana, would she be fooled into thinking she had learned what it's like to see yellow?",
    "answer": "No, Mary would likely not be fooled, as she is a brilliant scientist who would probably check the properties of the banana and deduce what frequency of electromagnetic radiation it reflects, realizing that it's just a blue banana and not yellow at all.",
