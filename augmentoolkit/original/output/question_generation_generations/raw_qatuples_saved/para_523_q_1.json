    "paragraph": " It is intrinsically bad that any of these states of affairs obtains, that propositions to the effect that they obtain are true, and the obtaining of each is also intrinsically bad. The intrinsic goodness or badness of these and other moral objec\u00ad tives supervenes upon the nature of the objective, taken completely in abstraction from other objectives. Each of the objectives indicated above is either intrinsically good or intrinsically bad regardless of whether it has any extrinsic value. Most if not indeed all objectives, however, have extrinsic as well as intrinsic value. Such extrinsic value is either instrumental, contributory, or both. Indeed, it seems that any intrinsically good objective, taken completely in abstraction from any instrumental value it might have, contributes to making the world, which is the most comprehensive whole of which it is a part, intrinsically better than it would be were the objective replaced by some intrinsically bad objective or by some intrinsically good objec\u00ad tive having less positive value. Thus, taking the fulfillment or the non\u00ad fulfillment of a given person's absolute duty in a given situation com\u00ad pletely in abstraction from the obtaining of all other possible states of affairs, the world is intrinsically better if he fulfills his duty than it would be were he not to do so. The preceding applies, with the neces\u00ad sary changes, to any intrinsically bad objective. The contributory value of an objective, however, can be outweighed by its instrumental value. This would happen if its negative instrumental value were greater than its positive contributory value or if its positive instrumental value were greater than its negative contributory value. It is also possible that the contributory value of an objective outweigh its instrumental value. This Moral and Non-Moral Value 83 would occur if it had no instrumental value at all, as sometimes hap\u00ad pens.",

    "question": "How do intrinsic and extrinsic values of an objective relate to each other?",
    "answer": "Intrinsic value is the value of an objective in itself, while extrinsic value is the value it has in relation to other objectives. Extrinsic value can be either instrumental (related to achieving a goal) or contributory (making the world a better place), and can outweigh or be outweighed by the objective's intrinsic value.",
