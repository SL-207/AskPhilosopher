    "paragraph": " (B) How are we to decide whether something counts as knowl- edge or not? The problem is, as it was with sorting apples, it seems that we need to know the answer to (A) before we can answer (B), but we need to know the answer to (B) before we can answer (A). It seems that we are stuck. We simply aren\u2019t in a position to determine what we actually know. Now, we might just assume an answer to (A) and use that to an- swer (B), or we might assume an answer to (B) and use that to answer (A). But, in either case, it seems like we would be begging the ques- tion against anyone who went the other way. That is, if you assume an answer to (A) and someone else assumes an answer to (B), neither of you would have any claim to having a better answer than the other one does when all is said and done. In light of this, we might worry that there is no way to legitimately answer either question. This, of course, would spell doom for a major project in epistemology\u2014it would mean that we cannot know what is required for knowledge or even which of our beliefs count as knowledge. Of course, even if this problem only arose for epistemologists trying to come up with a theory of knowledge, it would be significant. It is, however, much more threatening than that. Think about ethical rea- soning. When we try to figure out the correct moral theory, we face a version of the problem of the criterion. After all, we are trying to answer these two questions: (A*)\t Which actions are morally permissible? (B*) How are we to decide whether something is morally permissible? THE PROBLEM OF THE CRITERION 73 Again, it seems that we cannot answer (A*) without first having an answer to (B*), and vice versa. It is hard to see how we could ever go about determining the correct moral theory without running smack into this problem. We might worry that, as with the case of knowl- edge, we are left in a position where we cannot determine the correct theory of what makes actions morally permissible or even which ac- tions are morally permissible.",
