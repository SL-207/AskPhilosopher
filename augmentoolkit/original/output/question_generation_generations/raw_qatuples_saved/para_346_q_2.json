    "paragraph": " And Kenji votes that Ted failed to demonstrate excellence in research but did in teaching, so he votes that Ted not be promoted. Putting this all in a table can help make things clearer: Jorge Christine Kenji Committee Excellent Research Yes Yes No Yes Excellent Teaching Yes No Yes Yes Promote Yes No No No When we consider the committee\u2019s position, we notice something strange\u2014the committee\u2019s decision violates the rules. The commit- tee\u2019s position is that Ted demonstrated both excellence in research and excellence in teaching, but he shouldn\u2019t be promoted. That\u2019s an irrational position. To see this more clearly, the idea is that excellent research and excellent teaching entail that Ted deserves a promotion. So, in essence, the committee is committed to accepting claims that entail a conclusion while at the same time denying that conclusion\u2014 that\u2019s irrational. Notice though that none of the individual members of the committee voted irrationally. Jorge voted that Ted satisfied both criteria and deserves the promotion, which is rational. Christine and Kenji each voted that Ted satisfied one criterion, but not the other, so they each voted that he shouldn\u2019t be promoted. Again, their com- bination of votes is rational. Hence, what this case seems to show is SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY 202 that the individual members of a group can all believe/vote rationally; yet when following the seemingly rational rule of majority rule, the group\u2019s beliefs/votes can end up irrational. As this is sometimes ex- pressed, when we aggregate rational individual positions following seemingly rational rules, we can end up with an irrational aggregation. RESPONSES One of the major responses to this sort of case is the proof of an \u00adimpossibility theorem (List and Pettit 2011). That is to say, it has been proven that it is impossible to satisfy certain seemingly rational \u00adconstraints on judgment aggregation at the same time.",

    "question": "Can you think of any reason why the individual members of the committee voted irrationally?",
    "answer": "No, the individual members of the committee did not vote irrationally. Jorge voted that Ted satisfied both criteria and deserved a promotion, which is a rational decision. Christine and Kenji each voted that Ted satisfied one criterion, but not the other, so they each voted that he shouldn't be promoted. Their individual votes are rational.",
