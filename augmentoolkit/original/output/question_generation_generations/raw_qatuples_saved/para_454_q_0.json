    "paragraph": " Recognition of this concern about the defeasibility of knowledge not being enough to block the problematic dogmatism leads other philosophers to argue that in order to solve this puzzle, we have to acknowledge that knowledge is defeasible and realize that even if we know that some evidence is misleading it doesn\u2019t always mean that we can reasonably ignore it. Various reasons have been offered for accept- ing the claim that knowing that some evidence is misleading isn\u2019t suf- ficient for reasonably ignoring the evidence. One reason is that while we might know that some evidence is misleading, we may not know that we know this. This approach claims that we need this additional knowledge about what we know in order to reasonably disregard ev- idence. A related reason that has been given is simply that we are too likely to be mistaken about whether some evidence is misleading or not (Veber 2004). As a result of our fallibility, when it comes to deter- mining whether evidence is misleading, we shouldn\u2019t ignore evidence. A final reason that some give is that misleading evidence concerning p might still be able to make it so that we should think that p is less likely to be true than we originally thought\u2014even when we know that the evidence is misleading (Ye 2016).

    "question": "Why might it not be sufficient to simply know that some evidence is misleading in order to reasonably disregard it?",
    "answer": "There are several reasons why it might not be sufficient to simply know that some evidence is misleading in order to reasonably disregard it. One reason is that you may not know that you know that the evidence is misleading. Another reason is that you are likely to be mistaken about whether some evidence is misleading or not, due to your fallibility. A third reason is that misleading evidence can still make it so that you should think that a particular proposition is less likely to be true than you originally thought, even when you know that the evidence is misleading.",
