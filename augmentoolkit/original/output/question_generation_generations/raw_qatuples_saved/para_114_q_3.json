It is his being honest that makes the obtaining of the first state of affairs good, his being blind that makes the obtaining of the second bad. From the preceding, however, it does not follow that universals can be either good or bad regardless of whether they are exemplified by partic\u00ad ulars, just as from the fact that the nature of states of affairs determines whether their obtaining would be good or bad it does not follow that they can be either good or bad regardless of whether they obtain. What inclines some to suppose that unexemplified universals and states of af\u00ad fairs that do not obtain can be good or bad'would seem to be consider\u00ad ations such as the following. If universals as such can be neither good nor bad, how can their exemplifications be good or bad? Similarly, if states of affairs as such can be neither good nor bad, how can their ob\u00ad taining or their not obtaining be good or bad? How can the obtaining or the non-obtaining of something that itself can be neither good nor bad be good or bad? It would be as if by magic that goodness and badness appear suddenly on the scene out of elements that themselves can be nei\u00ad ther good nor bad. But that this is what happens does seem in fact to be the case. If in fact it is the case, then perhaps goodness and badness, if they can correctly be said to be properties, may rightly be regarded as emergent properties. They emerge from conjunctions of elements that, taken in isolation from one another, are neither good nor bad. Such emergence would seem to occur in the following ways. The exemplification of a universal, taken completely in abstraction from any consideration of the universal exemplified, can be neither good nor bad.",
