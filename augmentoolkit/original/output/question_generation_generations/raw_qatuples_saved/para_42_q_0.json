    "paragraph": " Nowadays, cognitive science and neuroscience are progressing at ever-increasing rates. So much so that, though there remains much to learn, it might seem all but inevitable that a scientific explanation of consciousness is forthcoming. Former mysteries, including some about life itself, are mysteries no longer. Why should consciousness be any different? In fact, there may be a reason. Some argue that consciousness presents an especially perplexing difficulty, which David J. Chalmers (1995) calls the hard problem of consciousness. We use terms like \u201cconscious\u201d and \u201cconsciousness\u201d in different ways. For example, sometimes we want to mark the distinction between being awake and being asleep, as in 4 The Hard Problem of Consciousness 19 \u201cI lost consciousness the minute my head hit the pillow.\u201d Sometimes we want to indicate awareness, as in: \u201cYes, I am fully conscious that my socks have holes in them.\u201d And sometimes we mean subjective experience, such as the pain of arthritis, the visual experience of see- ing a red rose, or the existential angst one might feel while contem- plating Sartre\u2019s reflections on death. What unites such diverse states is that there is something it\u2019s like to have them (Nagel 1974; see Chapter 5). It is this last sort of consciousness\u2014the \u201cwhat-it\u2019s-like\u201d sort, also known as phenomenal consciousness\u2014that the hard problem concerns. In this chapter, we\u2019ll refer to that aspect of consciousness simply as \u201cexperience.\u201d THE CASE At the moment, my elbow hurts. We know from science that my pain experience, along with all of my other experiences, happens as a result of brain processes. For each of us, our brain creates a subjective inner life, rich with pains, pleasures, images, moods, etc. But how does that happen? Our brains are continuously processing information acquired from our senses. Why is this information processing accompanied by experiences? Why doesn\u2019t the brain\u2019s activity go on in the dark, so to speak?",

    "question": "Why might the scientific explanation of consciousness seem inevitable, given the progress made in cognitive science and neuroscience?",
    "answer": "There is a strong reason to believe that a scientific explanation of consciousness is forthcoming, because the field is advancing rapidly and many mysteries, including those about life, have been solved in the past.",
