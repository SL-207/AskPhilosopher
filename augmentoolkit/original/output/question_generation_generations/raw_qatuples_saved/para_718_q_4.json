    "paragraph": " According to illusionism, qualia do not really exist; we are merely under the illusion that they exist. The Coffee Tasters 53 Reflection on cases like Chase and Sanborn help bring attention to the nature of this illusion. Though illusionism has some persistent supporters, it remains a minority view; and most philosophers remain unpersuaded that the Chase and Sanborn case presents a deep puzzle. Criticisms of this thought experiment often point to the role that memory seems to be playing in Dennett\u2019s discussion. For example, Ned Block (1995) sug- gests that Chase and Sanborn\u2019s mistakes are all traceable to problems with their memories of qualia. But when defenders of the traditional conception of qualia suggest that qualia are meant to be directly ap- prehensible, that is meant to apply to current qualitative experience. The fact that we might incorrectly remember the precise qualitative nature of past qualitative experiences does not show that the notion of qualia is confused. A related criticism of Dennett\u2019s discussion suggests that he has in- terpreted the notion of direct and immediate apprehensibility too strongly. As Dennett interprets it, individuals are required to be com- pletely infallible about their own qualitative experience. But we might accept that people can make various mistakes about their qualitative experiences while still holding onto the traditional conception of qualia. For example, suppose you are walking alone late at night and someone comes up behind you, presses something into your back, and says, \u201cDon\u2019t move. I have a knife and I\u2019m not afraid to use it.\u201d You take yourself to be experiencing a sharp pain. As the moments go by, however, you realize that the sensation you thought was painful is really just cold. It turns out that there was no knife, but just a frozen popsicle. It can still be the case that you were directly and immediately apprehending the sensation all along, even if your initial assessment of what you were experiencing was mistaken.",

    "question": "Can you think of an example where someone might experience a sensation that they initially interpret as one thing, but later realize it is actually something else?",
    "answer": "Yes, here's an example: suppose someone is walking alone late at night and someone comes up behind them, presses something into their back, and says, \"Don't move. I have a knife and I'm not afraid to use it.\" The person takes themselves to be experiencing a sharp pain, but as the moments go by, they realize that the sensation they thought was painful is actually just cold. It turns out that there was no knife, but just a frozen popsicle. In this case, it can still be the case that the person was directly and immediately apprehending the sensation all along, even if their initial assessment of what they were experiencing was mistaken.",
