    "paragraph": " The 43-second discrepancy could only be adequately explained within the context of the General Theory of Relativity. Crucial to the explanation was Einstein\u2019s insight that spacetime is curved; and it\u2019s the curvature of spacetime that affects the orbit of Mercury. From these examples, Churchland concludes that we should be skeptical of philosophers\u2019 judgments about which problems concern- ing consciousness are particularly hard. Even more so, we should be skeptical of claims that certain problems about consciousness might be unsolvable. The history of science is \u201cchock-full of phenomena deemed too mysterious ever to be understood by mere mortals, but which eventually did yield to explanation\u201d (Churchland 2013, p. 57). As she suggests, in advance of the relevant scientific discovery, it can be very difficult to assess which problems are harder than oth- ers, which will be solved sooner, and which will be more tractable. Such judgments will too often have the effect of hornswoggling us. Summarizing the philosophical lesson she wants to draw, Churchland notes that, \u201cwhen not much is known about a topic, don\u2019t take terri- bly seriously someone else\u2019s heartfelt conviction about what problems are scientifically tractable. Learn the science, do the science, and see what happens\u201d (1996, p. 408). DISCUSSION A related response to the hard problem can be seen in Daniel C. Dennett\u2019s (1996) work (see Chapter 9). Though Dennett does not talk of hornswoggling, he too seems to think that the hard problem of consciousness seems hard to us only because we are being deceived or misled in some way. Moreover, like Churchland, Dennett calls upon scientific analogies in an attempt to show where things have gone CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 58 wrong. One such analogy involves vitalism (an analogy also used by Churchland). When faced with the mystery of what life was and how to explain it, the vitalists too might be described as seeing a hard problem.",

    "answer": "The 43-second discrepancy was a phenomenon that could only be adequately explained within the context of the General Theory of Relativity. This theory, proposed by Einstein, explains that spacetime is curved, and it is the curvature of spacetime that affects the orbit of Mercury.",
