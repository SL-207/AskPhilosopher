    "paragraph": " Take Super Bowl XX again. If you know that an article which says the New England Patriots won Super Bowl XX is mistaken, it seems that you should disregard what that article says about the game. The evidence that this article would provide about Super Bowl XX is PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 218 misleading, and you know that it is misleading. So far so good, but we are getting close to something puzzling. Let\u2019s consider one more thing that seems clearly true: we shouldn\u2019t be dogmatic in our beliefs. In other words, we should be open to changing our minds about things, and we should believe in accordance with the evidence that we have rather than believing things because we want them to be true. These seemingly obvious principles along with some uncontro- versial points about the nature of knowledge yield a challenging puzzle. Let\u2019s say that you know some particular proposition, p. Since you know that p, any evidence against p is misleading. Why? Well, it is uncontroversial that if you know that p, then p is true. In fact, to say that \u201cyou know that p is true\u201d is just another way of saying \u201cyou know that p.\u201d So, you know that p, and this means that p is true. Now let\u2019s assume that you gain some evidence, E, that provides reason for thinking that p is false. What should you do? Given that your knowing that p entails that p is true and given the truth of the principles we mentioned above, it seems that you should simply disregard E altogether. This may not seem to be much of a puzzle until we consider that this applies to anything you know and any ev- idence that you ever gain against something that you know. It seems that you should always simply ignore any evidence that goes against things that you know. But if you do this, it seems that you are being extremely dogmatic. In order to better appreciate the puzzling nature of what seems to be going on here, let\u2019s think about a concrete case.",
