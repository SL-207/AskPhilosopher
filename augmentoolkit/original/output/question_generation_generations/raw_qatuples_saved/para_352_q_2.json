    "paragraph": " This, however, does not mean that the value judgment is itself an \"ought\" judgment. Instead, what it means is that the value fact, which in one sense of the term \"fact\" is a true value proposition, 2 entails that we ought to refrain from doing a certain thing. Although it is not possible to derive \"ought\" judgments from \"is\" judgments when the latter state only facts that are not value facts, it is sometimes possible to derive \"ought\" from \"is\" judgments when the latter state value facts. Thus given the truth of the \"is\" value judg\u00ad ment that undeserved suffering is intrinsically bad, it follows that we have a prima f acie duty not to inflict such suffering on any creature, 62 The Nature of Value whether man or beast, and thus that we ought not to do so unless our doing so is necessary if we are to fulfill some weightier duty. Non-evaluative definitions of the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness are divisible into those that define these concepts in terms of various psychological phenomena and those that define them in terms of various non-evaluative phenomena that are not psychological in character. It was at least implied in chapter 1 that non-evaluative defin\u00ad itions of the first type are unacceptable. The psychological phenomena in terms of which the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness are most likely to be defined are divisible into 'the two major classes distin\u00ad guished in chapter 1. These are likings and dislikings on the one hand and val uings proper on the other. Although people do sometimes seem to mean nothing more by saying that a given thing, such as a movie, is good or bad than that they like or dislike it, there is still nonetheless a difference between likings and dislikings on the one hand and valuings proper on the other. As was pointed out in chapter 1, it is possible that a person like or dislike a given thing without regarding it as being good or bad, regard a given thing as being good or bad without liking or dis\u00ad liking it, and even like a given thing while regarding it as bad or dislike it while regarding it as good.",
