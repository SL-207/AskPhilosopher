    "paragraph": " And some argue that the teleological theories in question make the historical account of representational content conditional on features that ordinarily obtain\u2014features that are absent in Swampman cases. Michael Tye (2000) uses the latter strat- egy to defend representationalism about phenomenal content from a Swampman-type objection. He notes that \u00adrepresentationalism\u2019s ap- peal to a causal co-variational account involves a ceteris paribus (\u201cother things being equal\u201d) clause. Scientific generalizations often include such clauses, sometimes implicitly. For example, the \u00adgeneralization \u201cMixing an acid and a base produces salt\u201d is not falsified by the fact that in non-optimal circumstances\u2014e.g., the beaker \u00adcontaining the acid and the base is dropped before salt could be formed\u2014\u00admixing an acid and a base does not produce salt. Likewise, Tye argues, \u00adrepresentationalism\u2019s co-variational account is not falsified by the fact that in non-optimal circumstances, such as in the Swampman case, one could have representational states that have no history of \u00adco-\u00advarying with what they are about. As Tye (2000, p. 137) writes, \u201cIn these cases, ceteris is not paribus.\u201d RECOMMENDED READING CANONICAL PRESENTATION Davidson, Donald. 1987. \u201cKnowing One\u2019s Own Mind.\u201d Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association 60: 441\u201358.
