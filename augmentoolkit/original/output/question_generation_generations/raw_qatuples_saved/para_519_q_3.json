DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-7 WHAT IT\u2019S LIKE TO BE A BAT BACKGROUND According to physicalism, consciousness is a physical phenomenon. This is widely taken to imply that the nature of any creature\u2019s con- scious experience can be fully explained in objective, scientific terms. But that implication is hard to square with the apparent fact that ex- perience (phenomenal consciousness) is subjective, in the sense that there is something it is like to have an experience.",
