    "paragraph": " It is hard, that is, to see how all the members of any class can be indifferent if it is good for anyone to like any of them and bad to dislike or to be indifferent toward any if there is also another class all the members of which are such that it would be good for anyone to dislike any of them and bad for anyone to like or to be indifferent toward any. Indeed, perhaps part of what is meant by saying that all the members of a given class are good is that it would be good for anyone to like any of them and bad for anyone to dis\u00ad like or to be indifferent toward any, just as perhaps part of what is meant by saying that all the members of a given class are bad is that it would be good for anyone to dislike any of them and bad to like or to be indifferent toward any. 3 If so, then class a above would be a class whose members are good, class c a class whose members are bad. It is only the members of class b that would be indifferent. The individualistic version of the moderate view avoids this difficulty. This it does by denying that there are classes of the kind posited by the uniform version. Instead, it maintains, if a class consists entirely of in\u00ad different things, then each of its members is such that it can be good that one person like it, that a second be indifferent toward it, and perhaps also that a third person dislike it. It holds, that is, that any indifferent thing, by virtue of its being indifferent, is such that one person's liking it can be good, a second person's being indifferent toward it can be good, and perhaps also that a third person's disliking it can be good. Just as the goodness of a good thing supervenes upon its nature and the badness of a bad thing upon its nature, so also the indifference of an indifferent thing supervenes upon its nature. And just as the nature of a good thing makes liking it good and disliking or being indifferent to it bad and the nature of a bad thing makes disliking it good and liking or being indif\u00ad ferent to it bad, so also the nature of an indifferent thing is such that one 1 84 The Nature of Value person's liking it, another's being indifferent to it, and perhaps also an\u00ad other's disliking it can all be good.",
