    "paragraph": " It is also conceivable, however, that in certain situations a person's duty might be to perform some act that leads to less good than would some other act open to him and thus that he acts rightly in such situations even though his act leads to less good than would some other act open to him. If so, then Moore's definitions beg the question against opposing positions. Although his position concerning how a person must act in concrete sit\u00ad uations if he is to do his duty and act rightly might be correct, those who take an opposing position do not thereby necessarily misuse the terms \"duty\" and \"acting rightly\" or contradict themselves. This means that the terms in question cannot be defined adequately in the way Moore suggests. Instead, they can be defined adequately only if the def\u00ad inition presented is what may be referred to as a purely \"formal\" defin\u00ad ition that does not beg any substantive moral questions to which opposing answers have been or could be given. One way of attempting a purely formal definition of such concepts goes as follows. It relies on Ross's distinction between prima f acie and absolute duties.2 In any given concrete situation a person's absolute duty is to fulfill, or to do his best to fulfill, his weightiest prima f acie duty in that situation. A given prima f acie duty, a, might override another, b, in a situation of type x, yet be overridden by b in a situation of type y. If a situation is such that a person in that situation has two prima f acie duties, a and b, if both a and b override any other prima f acie duties he has in the situation, if neither a nor b overrides the other, and if a and b conflict so that they cannot both be fulfilled, the person's absolute duty in that situation is to do either a or b, and he acts rightly in doing, or in doing his best to do, either a or b. It might seem at first that in the preceding account the concept of prima facie duty is more fundamental than that of absolute duty, since the latter concept is explicated in terms of the former.",

    "question": "According to the account, is the concept of prima facie duty more fundamental than that of absolute duty?",
    "answer": "It might seem so, but actually, the concept of absolute duty is explicated in terms of prima facie duty, making the relationship between them more complex than initially apparent.",
