    "paragraph": " Are honesty and blindness themselves, for example, either good or bad when considered completely in abstraction from the question of whether they are exemplified by particulars? Or is it only their exempli\u00ad fication by particulars that can be good or bad? Different philosophers have taken opposing positions on this issue. Everett Hall, for example, argues that it is only the exemplification of universals by particulars, not universals taken in abstraction from such exemplification, that can have value.5 And recently Panayot Butchvarov has distinguished between abstract goods and concrete goods and argued that \"goodness is, strictly speaking, a property of properties, and that good concrete entities, which we may call concrete goods, exemplify it only, so to speak, indirectly, by exemplifying some other properties that exemplify goodness directly, and which we may call abstract goods. \"6 Thus for Butchvarov \"a person's life can be said to be good on the grounds that it is happy only if happiness itself can be said to be good. \"7 On this issue I side with Hall. The states of affairs consisting of John's being honest and John's being blind, if the John who is honest is identical with the John who is blind, differ from one another only if his being honest differs from his being blind. Moreover, his being honest can differ from his being blind only if there is a difference between being honest and being blind and therefore only if there is a difference between honesty and blindness. Since the John who is a constituent of the first state of affairs is identical with the John who is a constituent of the second state of affairs, the obtaining of the first can be good and the obtaining of the second bad only because there is a difference between being honest and being blind and thus between honesty and blindness. This can be put by saying that the ground of the goodness of the obtaining of the first state of affairs is that one of its constituents exemplifies honesty, whereas the source of the badness of the obtaining of the second is that one of its constituents exemplifies blindness.",

    "question": "In your opinion, what is the relationship between the states of affairs of John's being honest and John's being blind, and how do their differences relate to their value?",
    "answer": "I believe that the states of affairs of John's being honest and John's being blind differ from one another only if there is a difference between being honest and being blind. Moreover, their value depends on this difference, as the goodness of the first state of affairs is grounded in one of its constituents exemplifying honesty, whereas the badness of the second state of affairs is sourced in one of its constituents exemplifying blindness.",
