    "paragraph": " Her argument is wholly secular. THE CASE Most thought experiments begin directly with contemplation of a proposed scenario; but the one we consider in this chapter requires a brief prelude\u2014and, unfortunately, the prelude involves a bit of pain. Pinch yourself, say, on the underside of your left arm. You don\u2019t have to pinch very hard, but you should pinch forcefully enough that you CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 14 can focus on the pain you\u2019re feeling. Once you have that pain in focus, the thought experiment itself can begin. Imagine that you are feeling the very same pain you are feeling right now, even though you are completely disembodied. In this state, you experience the very same pain you are feeling right now, and it feels to you that the pain is on the underside of your left arm; but you don\u2019t have a left arm. Not only do you not have a left arm, but you also don\u2019t have a right arm. You have no bodily parts whatsoever. By successfully engaging in this thought experiment, you conceive of a case of disembodied pain. According to a long philosophical tra- dition, whatever is conceivable is possible. Granted, we can conceive of things that are physically impossible (or at least improbable), as when I conceive of dropping a tennis ball and having it float unsupported rather than falling to the ground. But the sense of possibility intended is not physical possibility but, rather, something stronger\u2014sometimes put in terms of metaphysical possibility and sometimes put in terms of logical possibility. Even if it is not physically possible for the ball to float unsupported, it is logically possible. In contrast, it is not logically possible for the ball to be at the same time both wholly spherical and wholly cubical. Moreover, if you were to try to conceive of this, you would fail. (Try it!) Given that you can conceive of a case of disembodied pain, it is (log- ically) possible for the particular pain under consideration to occur in a disembodied being.",

    "question": "Can you try to conceive of something that is not logically possible?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can try to conceive of a shape that is both wholly spherical and wholly cubical. If you try to do so, you will likely find that it is difficult or impossible to imagine such a shape.",
