    "paragraph": " Or at least the difference would not be even partly based, as it plainly is, on psychological facts about the person you observed saying \u201cGav- agai!\u201d and other native speakers of the language you\u2019re studying. Quine (1969) recognizes that such consequences of his doctrine can seem absurd, especially when one applies it to one\u2019s own words. In response to that sort of worry, he appeals to another doctrine: the rela- tivity of meaning and reference. In physics, a particle has a position and a velocity not in any absolute sense but only relative to a coordinate system. In Quine\u2019s view, the same is true of meaning and reference. As he puts it, \u201cReference is nonsense except relative to a coordinate system\u201d (1969, p. 47), where a \u201ccoordinate system\u201d is provided by a specific language, such as English. But does that analogy address the worry? In physics, the position and velocity of a particle consists en- tirely in its relations to a coordinate system. By contrast, there seems to be more to meaning than just the relations a term has to the language of which it is a part. Of course, which particular meaning a word has is relative to a language. For example, the word \u201cgift\u201d means present relative to English, but it means poison relative to German. Likewise, \u201crabbit\u201d means rabbit only relative to English. But meaning itself does not seem to be language-dependent. When we ask whether there is a translation of \u201crabbit\u201d into some other language, we are asking pre- cisely whether there is a term in that other language with the same (language-independent) meaning. Is rejecting behaviorism enough to undermine the case for Quine\u2019s indeterminacy doctrine? Many philosophers who reject behaviorism accept that doctrine, or something close to it. A prominent example is Donald Davidson. Although Davidson rejects behaviorism about men- tal states, he maintains a related view about semantics\u2014that is, linguistic meaning.",
