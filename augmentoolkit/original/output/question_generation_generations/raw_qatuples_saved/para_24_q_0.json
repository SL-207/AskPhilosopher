    "paragraph": " Swampman is physically and behaviorally indistinguishable from Donald. If you ask Swampman his name, or to explain his beliefs, he answers just as Donald would have. If you compare a scan of his brain at the moment he was cre- ated and a scan of Donald\u2019s brain a moment before he was vaporized, you will see no difference (other than the time stamp). Further, the remarkable similarity between Swampman and Donald is entirely a coincidence\u2014an astronomically improbable coincidence, but that is exactly what happened. Prior to the lightning bolt, Donald has the range of states with rep- resentational content that other normal human adults have, including beliefs, desires, perceptual experiences, and various other mental states. On teleological theories, his states have such content at least partly because of historical factors. Consider a simple example. Some of his mental states, such as his belief that grass is green, are about greenness. The explanation for this, according to teleological theories, is partly that he has experiences (or brain states) of a type that have historically co-varied with encounters with green-colored objects; such states have thus made contributions to human evolution. The details of such an explanation are complex and controversial. But, on all teleological theories, etiological/historical factors play a central role. And therein lies the problem posed by this thought experiment. There would appear to be strong intuitive reasons to conclude that Swampman has mental states with content\u2014for example, a belief that grass is green. If asked, he will say that grass is green. And if he tries CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 148 to visualize green grass, his imaginative experience will feel just like Donald\u2019s would if Donald tried to visualize green grass. Intuitively, like Donald, Swampman has a belief, and his belief is about grass and greenness.",

    "question": "What is the scenario presented in this text, and what is the implication of this scenario?",
    "answer": "The scenario presented is that of a person, Donald, who is vaporized by a lightning bolt, and then recreated as a being called Swampman, who is physically and behaviorally indistinguishable from Donald. The implication of this scenario is that Swampman's mental states and experiences are identical to Donald's, despite the fact that Swampman has no historical background or experience.",
