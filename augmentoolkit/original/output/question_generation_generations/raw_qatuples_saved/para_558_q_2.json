    "paragraph": " Liking or indifference toward another's disliking or indifference toward something good is bad, as is also disliking or indifference toward another's liking or indif\u00ad ference toward something good. Since, that is, both ( 1) liking or indif\u00ad ference toward something bad is bad and (2) disliking or indifference toward something good is bad, so also is liking or indifference toward such likings, dislikings, and indifferences. 6. Disliking Indifferent Things The individualistic version of the moderate view was characterized above as holding that it can be good not only to like or to be indifferent toward indifferent things but also as maintaining that perhaps it can also be good to dislike such things. From the fact, however, that it can be good to like or to be indifferent toward some such things it does not follow that it can also be good to dislike any. Just as most of us who like various indifferent things usually do so because we stand in some direct or indirect special relation to them, so also indifferent things are usually disliked because those who dislike them stand in some such relation to them. If, that is, a person stands in no such relation to a given indif\u00ad ferent thing of which he has experience or knowledge, he is more likely to be indifferent toward it than to like or dislike it. Given, however, that there are indifferent things and that some such things are sometimes dis\u00ad liked by some people, can such dislikings be good? That they can be extrinsically good seems undeniable, since disliking some such things 1 92 The Nature of Value can have better consequences than liking or being indifferent toward them would have. From this, however, it does not follow that they can also sometimes be intrinsically good. In considering this question it is important to remember that the exis\u00ad tence of a given indifferent thing might prevent the existence of some\u00ad thing good, in the sense that were the indifferent thing not to exist something good would exist in its place, and that because of this the indifferent thing might be disliked.",
