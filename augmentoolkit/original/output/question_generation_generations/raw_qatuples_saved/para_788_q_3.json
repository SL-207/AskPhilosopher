    "paragraph": " One might, if one prefer, say that I am ashamed of myself. Such a way of speaking is acceptable, provided that one realize that it is merely an elliptical way of saying that I am ashamed of myself because of my liking to look at the accident victims. I can be ashamed of myself only if there is something about me, such as my being or failing to be some\u00ad thing, my doing or failing to do something, or my liking or disliking something, of which I am ashamed. It is my being or failing to be some\u00ad thing, my doing or failing to do something, my liking or disliking some\u00ad thing that I am ashamed of, not simply myself regardless of what I am or fail to be, do or fail to do, like or dislike.

This is because my being or failing to be something, my doing or failing to do something, unlike my liking or disliking or my being ashamed of something, are not essentially intentional. They, like my liking or dis\u00ad liking something, can be liked or disliked and can be things of which I am ashamed. But unlike my liking or disliking or my being ashamed of something, they are not essentially intentional, and it is because of this that they are not first-order phenomena, .",
