    "paragraph": " Let\u2019s start with the former. The debate about the structure of justification has its origins in the writings of ancient philosophers like Aristotle and Sextus Empiricus. In order to appreciate this debate, it is helpful to think about the chal- lenge that gives rise to it, what is known as the \u201cregress of reasons.\u201d The regress of reasons is pretty much what it sounds like; it is a regress that we face when we attempt to give reasons for the things that we believe. One way to think about this challenge is in terms of a series of \u201cwhy\u201d questions. Let\u2019s assume that you justifiedly believe that the University of Alabama won the most recent College Football Playoff National Championship. Why do you believe this? Perhaps because you read that they won on the CNN app on your phone. Why do you believe what the CNN app says? A plausible response is that CNN is a reliable source for this sort of information. Why do you think that CNN is a reliable source of information? Of course, this process can just keep going. The regress of reasons is just that it seems that for anything we believe we could ask for reasons in support of it, and we JUSTIFICATION 116 could ask for reasons in support of those reasons, and we could ask for reasons in support of the reasons that support our reasons, and so on. The regress of reasons is a challenge because the unending nature of this search for reasons seems to suggest that we can\u2019t have the support for our reasons that is necessary for justification. The various positions concerning the structure of justification are simply attempts to solve the regress of reasons. By far, the two most prominent (non-skeptical) responses to this challenge are foundational- ism and coherentism. There are numerous ways of filling in the details of each of these responses to the regress of reasons, but for our purposes it will be enough to just go over the general form that these two responses take.",

    "question": "How does the regress of reasons relate to the concept of justification?",
    "answer": "The regress of reasons is related to the concept of justification because it highlights the need for support for our reasons in order to have justified beliefs. The unending nature of the search for reasons suggests that we may not be able to provide the necessary support for our beliefs, which makes it difficult to justify them.",
