    "answer": "The concept of value is defined in terms of several different types, including:\n\n* Contributory value: the value that something adds to a particular situation or outcome\n* Extrinsic value: the value that is derived from external factors or circumstances\n* Inherent value: the value that is inherent in something in and of itself\n* Instrumental value: the value that is derived from the use of something to achieve a particular goal or outcome\n* Intrinsic value: the value that is inherent in something and is not dependent on external factors\n* Negative value: the value that is derived from the absence of something\n* Neutral value: the value that is neither positive nor negative\n* Positive value: the value that is derived from the presence of something\n* Sentimental value: the value that is derived from emotional or personal attachment to something\n* Total value: the overall value of something, taking into account all of its different aspects and characteristics",
