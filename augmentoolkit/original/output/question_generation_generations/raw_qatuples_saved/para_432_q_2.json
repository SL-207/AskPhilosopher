    "paragraph": " On his view, the split-brain patient\u2019s stream of consciousness is realized serially by the two hemispheres, sometimes by one and then sometimes by the other. The switching happens very fast, however, and this accounts for the appearance that split-brain patients have two minds. Though Nagel (1971) agrees that we should not say that the split- brain subject has two minds, his reasoning is different from Bayne\u2019s. Rather than motivating the denial of claim 1 with the thought that a split-brain subject has only one mind, Nagel suggests that we should not try to assign a whole number of individual minds to the split- brain subject. The answer to the question \u201cHow many minds do they have?\u201d is neither one nor two. While there is a strong temptation to think that we must be able to answer this question with some whole number or other, Nagel urges us to resist the temptation. Yes, we can attribute conscious mental activity to a split-brain subject. But this assignment does not entail that there is a mind associated with this mental activity. Granted, in ordinary cases, we do not see mental ac- tivity that cannot be assigned to one unified mind or another; but Nagel suggests that we should not be surprised that an extraordinary phenomenon such as the split-brain patients would present us with something that can\u2019t be described in normal terms. In her discussion of the case, Wilkes goes even farther than Nagel. On her view, we should question whether the notion of a unified mind is even a coherent one. Even in our own cases, we may just be under an illusion that there is a unity of consciousness. Like the split- brain patients, we too may just be a system that happens to be more or less integrated, and there just happens to be a lot of cooperation in our own cases. Other philosophers have attempted to deny claim 2, that the split- brain subject is a single person. One particularly radical defense of this Split Brains and the Unity\u00a0Puzzle 277 claim is given by Roland Puccetti (1981).",
