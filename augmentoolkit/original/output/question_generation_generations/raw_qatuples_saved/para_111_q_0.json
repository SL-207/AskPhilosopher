DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-42 CHANGE BLINDNESS BACKGROUND We tend to think of conscious visual perception on the model of a color photograph (or video)\u2014as capturing the colors and shapes in one\u2019s visual field in remarkably rich detail. No doubt, things in front of our eyes have features to which we are oblivious. For one thing, there\u2019s a \u201cblindspot\u201d in the visual field, corresponding to where the optic nerve attaches to the retina. For another, unless we\u2019re wear- ing special goggles or something, we don\u2019t see infra-red light. But, within the range of humanly visible light, we usually see pretty much everything that a color photograph would capture (the blindspot area notwithstanding). Or so we tend to assume. Some philosophers chal- lenge that assumption on the basis of a psychological phenomenon called change blindness, which is the failure to notice something mark- edly different about a display. THE CASE You\u2019re first shown drawing A, then drawing B. They seem identical (though in fact they are not). You look again. Still nothing. Then you look a third time, and finally you see it: in drawing B, someone\u2019s glasses are missing.",

    "question": "What is the common assumption about conscious visual perception, and why might it be challenged?",
    "answer": "The common assumption is that conscious visual perception captures the colors and shapes in one's visual field in remarkably rich detail, similar to a color photograph or video. However, this assumption might be challenged because there are features to which we are oblivious, such as the \"blindspot\" in the visual field.",
