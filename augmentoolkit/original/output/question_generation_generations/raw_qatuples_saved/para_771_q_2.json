    "paragraph": " And in both the knowledge argument and the conceivability argument, the metaphysical gap often takes the form of a claim about possibility, such as the claim that there are truths about consciousness that might not obtain even if all the actual physical and functional truths were held fixed. Daniel Stoljar (2006) contends that the reasoning in both arguments is based on ignorance about either the nature of conscious- ness or the nature of the physical world, or both. He supports that contention with his case of the slugs and the tiles. 11 CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 62 THE CASE Imagine a community of intelligent slugs. They live on a mosaic con- taining circles, rectangles, figure eights, and various other shapes, all of which are constructed from two basic sorts of tiles: triangular tiles and pie-piece shaped tiles (sectors of circles). The slugs\u2019 perceptual access to the mosaic is limited. They have one shape-detecting system for triangles and another for circles, but that is all. They don\u2019t have a perceptual system enabling them to detect sector-shaped tiles. Some slug philosophers believe that the circular tiles are composed entirely of non-circular tiles and, more specifically, of triangular tiles. Other slug philosophers reject that view on the basis of arguments analogous to the knowledge and conceivability arguments, and they treat facts about the circular tiles as basic. They conjure Slug Mary, who knows all non-circular truths about the mosaic, but who is not permitted to exercise her circle detector. They contend that she would be in no position to know whether the mosaic contains circles. Then they continue to reason in a way that parallels the knowledge argu- ment, concluding that the circular tiles are basic tiles: they are not composed of non-circular tiles. In other words, they give their own version of the knowledge argument. They also give their own version of the zombie argument.",

    "question": "What is the significance of Slug Mary in the context of the argument?",
    "answer": "Slug Mary is a hypothetical slug who knows all non-circular truths about the mosaic but is not permitted to exercise her circle detector. Her existence is used to argue that she would be in no position to know whether the mosaic contains circles, and this is used to support the idea that the circular tiles are basic tiles.",
