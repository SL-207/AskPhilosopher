    "paragraph": " To guard against this kind of implausible result, Clark and Chalm- ers suggest four conditions that must be met in order for an external storage device to count as part of the mind and for the information stored in it to count as a standing belief. Where S is the subject and D is the relevant device: 1. D must be consistently and reliably available, and it must be typically called upon by S. 2. The information in D is easily accessible to S when it is needed. 3. S automatically endorses information from D. 4. The information is present in D because it was consciously endorsed by S in the past. It\u2019s condition (4) that rules out newly Googled information counting as someone\u2019s standing belief. That information need not have ever been consciously endorsed by that individual. The linchpin of Clark and Chalmers\u2019 argument consists in two claims. First is a claim often referred to as the parity principle: anything that plays the same causal-explanatory role as a standing belief is itself a standing belief. Second is a claim about Otto: the information in Otto\u2019s notebook plays the same causal-explanatory role as that played by standing beliefs stored within his brain. While the first claim is widely accepted (at least by those who endorse functionalism about belief; see Chapters 15 and 16), the second claim has frequently come under attack by critics. In arguing against the second claim, critics often point to what seems like a salient difference between the information in Otto\u2019s notebook and standing beliefs stored in the brain: Otto accesses his notebook via perception; but he accesses standing beliefs by way of introspection. Other differences that also seem salient include the fact that Otto\u2019s notebook can easily be tampered with (much more easily than a brain can be tampered with), and the fact that Otto\u2019s notebook might be shared with someone else. Neither of those claims seems to hold of internal beliefs.",
