    "paragraph": " Another is rep- resentationalism, on which qualia are identified with representational properties, which are themselves characterized in causal, historical, or functional terms (see Chapter 19). A third is physicalism, on which everything, including color experience, is physical (see Chapters 4 and 12). 20 PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 116 THE CASE Imagine two people we will call Invert and Non-vert. Non-vert is a typical color-sighted person. When she sees oxygenated blood, fire engines, and stop signs, she has a visual experience with a distinc- tive phenomenal quality (or quale) that might be called phenomenal \u00adredness. When she sees grass, cucumbers, and unripe bananas, she has a visual experience with a different phenomenal quality, which might be called phenomenal greenness. Invert is atypical. When she sees \u00adoxygenated blood, fire engines, and stop signs, her visual experience is not phenomenally red but rather phenomenally green. When she sees grass, cucumbers, and unripe bananas, her visual experience is not phenomenally green but rather phenomenally red. This inverted qualia case is interpersonal. There are also intrap- ersonal cases. Imagine that someone who has never been inverted becomes inverted overnight (Wittgenstein 1968, Shoemaker 1982, Block 1990). Perhaps this happens because inverting lenses were sur- reptitiously placed on his eyes while he slept. At first, he might well say things like, \u201cTo me, grass looks red and blood looks green!\u201d But we can suppose he learns to adapt to use color words, calling grass \u201cgreen\u201d and blood \u201cred.\u201d Once he is fully adapted, he is functionally undetectable from people whose color vision is not inverted, except that he remembers how he experienced the world prior to his inver- sion. But that exception can be removed. We can simply suppose that he develops amnesia about that earlier period. Inverted qualia cases have been discussed at least since John Locke imagined one in 1689.",

    "question": "Describe the case of Invert, a person who has an unusual experience of color.",
    "answer": "Invert sees oxygenated blood, fire engines, and stop signs as having a phenomenal green quality, rather than the typical phenomenal red quality of these objects for other people. Conversely, Invert sees grass, cucumbers, and unripe bananas as having a phenomenal red quality, rather than the typical phenomenal green quality.",
