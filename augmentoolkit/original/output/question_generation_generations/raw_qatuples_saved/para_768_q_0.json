    "paragraph": " The idea here is that our intuitions about the New Evil Demon Problem are muddled because we tend to run to- gether justification and excusability/blamelessness. We would excuse Denny for believing as they do, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Denny\u2019s beliefs are justified. RECOMMENDED READING GENERAL OVERVIEWS The New Evil Demon Problem.

Oxford: Oxford University Press. 24 PSYCHIC POWERS (CLAIRVOYANCE CASES) Background: One of the simplest externalist theories of epistemic justifi- cation is what we might call \u201csimple process reliabilism\u201d. Simple process reliabilism says that S\u2019s belief that p is justified if and only if the belief is produced by a reliable belief-forming process. The key point here is again (see The Unfortunate Twin pp. 120\u2013124) that on this account S doesn\u2019t need to have any evidence or reasons at all in support of p in order to be justified in believing that p. All that matters is that S\u2019s belief is produced in the right way.",

    "question": "What are the two concepts that are often linked together, but may actually be distinct, according to this idea?",
    "answer": "Justification and excuse/blamelessness are two concepts that are often linked together, but may actually be distinct. Excusing someone for their beliefs does not necessarily mean that those beliefs are justified.",
