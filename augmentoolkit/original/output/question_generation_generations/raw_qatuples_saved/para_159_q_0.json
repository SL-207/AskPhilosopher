    "paragraph": " One way of fleshing out this sort of response is to maintain that testimonial knowledge requires both the testifier and the recipient of that testimony to be reliable (Riggs 2009). The former must be a reliable testifier and the latter must be reliable in receiv- ing testimony. Hence, on this view of testimony, in order for Bob to gain knowledge from the stranger\u2019s testimony Bob must be reliable in separating good and bad testimony. As a result, the response contends Bob\u2019s believing truly in this case is to his credit. A different response claims that credit for believing the truth can be shared (Greco 2010). The thought here is that the reason we tend to think that Bob doesn\u2019t deserve credit for believing the truth about how to get to the Empire State Building is that we are thinking about whether he alone deserves the credit. However, when we re- alize that credit can be shared between Bob and the woman who gives him directions, we realize that there isn\u2019t a problem for the credit view here because Bob deserves some of the credit for what he comes to know.
