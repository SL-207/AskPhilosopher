    "paragraph": " For example, it appears to be obviously true that if it is rational to believe that it is raining and it is rational to believe that you have your umbrella, then it is rational to believe it is raining and you have your umbrella. Third, there\u2019s what we might call \u201cNO CONTRADICTION\u201d. NO CONTRADICTION is just that it isn\u2019t rational to believe a contradiction. In other words, it\u2019s not rational to believe p and not p at the same time. Although all three of these principles are plausible, the Lottery Paradox seems to show that they cannot all be true. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: LOTTERY PARADOX Henry has recently purchased a ticket for a lottery with 100 tickets total. He knows that the lottery is fair, and it is guaranteed to have PUZZLES AND PARADOXES 240 only one winning ticket. The drawing has just occurred, but Henry hasn\u2019t learned the results yet. What should he think about his ticket? While many claim that Henry doesn\u2019t know that his ticket lost, most people think that it would be reasonable for him to believe that it did. After all, it\u2019s 99% likely that Henry\u2019s ticket is a losing ticket. It seems that Henry is reasonable in thinking that his ticket, let\u2019s say that his is ticket #1, lost. Of course, if it is reasonable for Henry to think that ticket #1 (his ticket) lost, it seems equally reasonable for him to think that ticket #2 lost. It\u2019s just as likely that ticket #2 lost as it is that ticket #1 lost. The same is apparently true for ticket #3 as well, and it is true for each of the other tickets too. It is 99% likely that any given ticket in the lottery is a losing ticket. So, it seems that it is reasonable for Henry to believe of each ticket that it lost. But of course if it\u2019s reason- able for Henry to believe that ticket #1 lost and to believe that ticket #2 lost and that ticket #3 lost and so on, it seems that it is reasona- ble for him to believe \u201cticket #1 and ticket #2 and ticket #3 and\u2026 ticket #100 lost\u201d.",
