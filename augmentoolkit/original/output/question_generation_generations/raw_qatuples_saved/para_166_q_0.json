    "paragraph": " 7. The Value of Knowledge This long (perhaps overly long) discussion of deception was occasioned by our earlier discussion of the relation of practical to theoretical reason The Primacy of Practical Rationality 143 and of the primacy of practical over theoretical reason. Such primacy means that attempts at deception, whether of oneself or others, are sometimes justified because necessary for the realization of certain goals the attainment of which has greater value than the realization of certain of the aims of theoretical reason would have. It must, however, be remembered and indeed emphasized that something of value, some\u00ad times something of great value, is frequently lost when the claims of the\u00ad oretical reason are overridden, regardless of however justified their sac\u00ad rifice might be. It must also be remembered and emphasized that any sacrifice of the ends of theoretical reason requires justification precisely because of the loss, sometimes small but sometimes great, of the values of knowledge and understanding. We must also remember and empha\u00ad size that attempting to deceive others imperils something else of great value. This is the trust and friendship between persons that relies upon honesty and truthfulness. The possible loss of such trust and friendship is something that must carefully be taken into account when endeav\u00ad oring in a concrete existential situation to determine the cost of decep\u00ad tion. If the attempt to deceive another fails, we have a duty to explain to him why we believed the attempt to be justified. And if, having suc\u00ad ceeded in deceiving another, our situation changes so that our con\u00ad tinued deception is no longer justified, we have a duty to cease the deception and explain why we believe our deception was justified. The fact that people do not like to be deceived indicates, I believe, not only that they do not like to be treated merely as things to be used for our attaining whatever ends we might set ourselves, but also that they place some value on such goals of theoretical reason as knowledge and under\u00ad standing.",

    "question": "What is the primary reason for justifying deception, and what does this imply about the relative importance of practical and theoretical reason?",
    "answer": "The primary reason for justifying deception is the realization of certain goals that have greater value than the realization of certain aims of theoretical reason. This implies that practical reason takes precedence over theoretical reason in certain situations.",
