    "paragraph": " The disembodiment scenarios and the corresponding arguments \u00adproposed by Descartes, Gertler, and Hart attempt to establish the \u00adpossibility of mental states existing without the physical states that typically correspond to them. Other conceivability arguments, such as the argument based on the Zombie thought experiment (see Chap- ter 7), attempt to establish the possibility of physical states without the corresponding mental states, in particular, without phenomenally conscious mental states\u2014that is, without states that are conscious in the sense that there\u2019s something it\u2019s like to have them (see Chapter 5). Conceivability arguments have long come in for criticism. One basic criticism dates back to an objection that Antoine Arnauld posed to Descartes. Someone without a deep understanding of geometry might think that they are conceiving of a right triangle for which the Pythagorean theorem does not hold. But the Pythagorean theorem holds for all right triangles, so the given scenario is not possible. Thus, it looks like conceivability does not entail possibility. (This objec- tion can be found in the fourth set of replies in the \u201cSelections from the Objections and Replies\u201d in Descartes 1641/2017; see also the \u00adcriticisms of Leibniz\u2019s mill argument in Chapter 2) Descartes had attempted to guard against this type of objection by insisting that only when a conception is clear and distinct will CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 16 conceivability entail possibility. When someone is ignorant of geom- etry, their attempts to conceive of right triangles will not be clear and distinct. Like Descartes, Gertler suggests that it is only when the con- cepts involved are sufficiently comprehensive that conceiving of a given scenario will entail that the scenario is possible. But when does a concept meet this standard? Though Gertler admits that this is a high standard, she does not give us a precise answer; instead, she provides some examples to help flesh out the notion.",

    "question": "Can you think of a scenario where someone might be able to conceive of something that is impossible for them?",
    "answer": "Yes, someone who is ignorant of geometry might think that they are conceiving of a right triangle for which the Pythagorean theorem does not hold. However, the Pythagorean theorem holds for all right triangles, so the given scenario is not possible. This is an example of how conceivability does not necessarily entail possibility.",
