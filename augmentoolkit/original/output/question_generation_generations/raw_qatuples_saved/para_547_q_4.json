    "paragraph": " Gottlob Frege is presented in an irreducible GF-ish way to himself, and John Perry is presented in a JP-ish way to himself. Perhaps this is because Frege has an unshareable concept and Perry has his own unshareable concept. Or perhaps this is because each is self-acquainted\u2014\u00addirectly aware of themselves with- out conceptual mediation\u2014and no one can be acquainted with anyone other than themselves. There is also a third possibility (though perhaps not consistent with some of \u00adFrege\u2019s views), according to which there is a single primitive indexical concept, which we each have but which refers to me when I use it and you when you use it. When GF uses that con- cept he refers to GF, and when JP uses that same concept he refers to JP. The Essential Indexical 293 According to David Kaplan (1989) and John Perry (1979), indexi- cal beliefs have both a content and a character. The content of Descartes\u2019 belief he would express as \u201cI am thinking\u201d is simply the proposition Descartes is thinking, where Descartes himself is a constituent of the proposition. When Frege thinks the same sort of I-thought, he is thinking something completely different, namely Frege is thinking. But there is also something in common between their two thoughts\u2014the character. The character is, roughly, the way that the content is thought. The character of I-thoughts just picks out the thinker of that thought. Indexicals on this view don\u2019t figure into the content of thoughts at all, but only into the way those contents are thought. Roderick Chisholm (1981) and David K. Lewis (1979) suggest a different theory. One way to put their theory is that, instead of treating I-beliefs as an odd case that requires tweaks to our picture of certain thoughts, they treat these I-beliefs as the foundations for all thought\u2014 in some sense, all thought is I-thought. To put it in Lewis\u2019 terms, all belief is self-ascriptive in the sense that when I believe \u00adsomething\u2014 whether it\u2019s a belief I would express using \u201cI\u201d or not\u2014I am attributing a property to myself.",

    "question": "According to Roderick Chisholm and David K. Lewis, what is the foundation of all thought?",
    "answer": "According to Chisholm and Lewis, I-beliefs are the foundations for all thought. This is because all belief is self-ascriptive, meaning that when you believe something, you are attributing a property to yourself, whether you use the word \"I\" or not.",
