    "paragraph": " EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUE: THE PROBLEM OF CONTINGENCY OF BELIEF Let\u2019s consider a few scenarios. Unlike many of the scenarios we have discussed (and will discuss later in this book), these scenarios are not at all outlandish. In fact, they are pretty common. Scenario 1: Hannah is a Christian. She and her friend Horatio are having a discussion about religion. Horatio says, \u201ceven if Christianity is true, you can\u2019t know that it is.\u201d To this Hannah replies, \u201cWhy not?\u201d Horatio answers, \u201cYou only believe Christianity because you were born and raised in the Bible Belt.\u201d (The term \u201cBible Belt\u201d refers to a region of the southern U.S. where Protestant Christianity plays a strong role in politics and society at large.) \u201cIf,\u201d Horatio continues: LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 86 you had been born somewhere else you wouldn\u2019t be a Christian. For exam- ple, if you had been born and raised in Saudi Arabia, you\u2019d be a Muslim. Or, if you had been born and raised in Japan, you likely wouldn\u2019t be reli- gious at all. \u201cSo? Maybe I\u2019m just lucky,\u201d Hannah says. To which, Horatio responds: That\u2019s my point! Even if you are right and Christianity is true, it\u2019s just a matter of luck that you believe it. It\u2019s not because of good evidence; it\u2019s because of where you happened to be born. You don\u2019t know it\u2019s true. Scenario 2: Philosophers Abdul and Anna are talking about epistemol- ogy. In particular, they are arguing over internalism and externalism (see General Background: The Nature of Justification pp. 113\u2013119). Finally, Abdul exclaims, \u201cYou\u2019re only an internalist because you studied at the University of Rochester! If you had went to a different school, you\u2019d be an externalist like me.\u201d Anna responds, \u201cWell, you\u2019re only an ex- ternalist because you were at Rutgers! If you had went to a different school, then you\u2019d be an internalist like me.\u201d Scenario 3: Pedro and Penelope are discussing politics. It turns out that Pedro is a Republican and Penelope is a Democrat.",

    "question": "What does Pedro's political affiliation imply about his beliefs?",
    "answer": "Nothing; the text does not provide any information about Pedro's reasons for being a Republican.",
