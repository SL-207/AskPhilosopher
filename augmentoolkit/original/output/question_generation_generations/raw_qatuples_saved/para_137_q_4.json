    "paragraph": " There is nothing wrong with such ways of speaking, as long as they do not mislead us into supposing that such abstract universals and states of affairs are themselves good or bad. Certainly such ways of speaking, provided that they do not thus mislead us, are preferable to the rather tortuous cir- Ontological Categories and Bearers of Value 33 cumlocutions with which this chapter is replete. If, however, my argu\u00ad ment is sound, such ways of speaking \u00b7are elliptical. To say that a given universal, such as happiness, is good is an elliptical way of saying either that exemplifications of it are or would be good or that it is or would be good that it is or that it be exemplified. And to say that a given state of affairs, such as John's being happy, is good is an elliptical way of saying either that its obtaining is or would be good or that it is good that it obtains or that it would be good that it do so. Understood in this way, abstract universals and states of affairs can with truth be said to be good or bad. But although abstract universals and states of affairs do not, except in an elliptical sense, have intrinsic value, they do have contributory value in a straightforward non-elliptical sense. The parts of a whole have contributory value if they contribute to the value of the whole, and the degree of their contributory value is determined by, or consists of, the degree to which they determine the value of the whole. It is possible that certain parts of a given whole have no intrinsic value at all, yet have contributory value because they contribute to the value of the whole. Moore goes as far as to say that \"it seems as if indifferent things may . . . be the sole constituents of a whole which has great value, either positive or negative.\" 9 I have suggested that abstract universals and states of affairs may be regarded as ontological constituents, elements, or parts of wholes and have argued that the value of a whole is determined, at least in part, by the nature of its abstract parts.",

    "answer": "It means that they are elements or components of a larger whole, and that the value of the whole is at least partially determined by the nature of its abstract parts.",
