    "paragraph": " The value of the special sciences is epistemological, in the sense that they help us comprehend events that would be hard to understand in the language of physics. But for many, such as Jerry Fodor in \u201cSpecial Sciences\u201d (1974), this concessive reaction is incorrect. According to Fodor, it underestimates the sense in which sciences such as psychology really do discover new laws\u2014interesting, predictively important, and coun- terfactually robust generalizations\u2014that are not present in the laws of physics. Just as important, the special sciences discover unified types of phenomena that relate to each other in a lawlike manner. Though Fodor\u2019s main concern is psychology, a consideration of economics makes things particularly plain. Consider the law that, other things being equal, prices are higher if there is more money in the economy. If this is true, it\u2019s not because of the physical stuff money is made of. Bits of currency can be made of paper, coins, or entries in electronic ledgers, all of which have dramatically different physical properties. The law of economics holds despite the diversity of these physical properties. While no law of physics is ever broken in economic transactions, the laws of economics are independent of physical laws. Someone who could see only physical properties and \u00adinteractions probably wouldn\u2019t even know there was an economy, much less understand why prices were suddenly high! The same thing is true of the laws of psychology. Beliefs and \u00addesires can be made of different physical things. In extreme cases, perhaps between androids and humans, some beliefs could be \u00adcarbon based and others silicon based. But even among animals there is certainly no guarantee\u2014or need for a guarantee\u2014that the same neural or \u00adsubatomic activity is going on in two creatures with the same \u00adbeliefs. Nevertheless, it is all-things-considered true that if an organism \u00adbelieves it is in danger and desires to get out of danger, it will try to do so.",

    "question": "Can the physical properties of currency affect the economic law that \"prices are higher if there is more money in the economy\"?",
    "answer": "No, the economic law is independent of physical laws and holds regardless of the physical properties of currency. For example, prices can be higher even if currency is made of paper, coins, or entries in electronic ledgers, all of which have different physical properties.",
