    "paragraph": " After all, MPW contains nothing but brains within brains\u2014it\u2019s brains all the way down. And if one supposes that panpsychism must be true of MPW, one should bear in mind that panpsychism is widely taken to be incompatible with \u00adphysicalism (Wilson 2006). If the two theories are indeed incompatible, then \u00adeither: (i) panpsychism could be false of MPW, in which case an ex- planation of how that could be is called for; or (ii) physicalism could not be true of MPW, even though all that world contains are brains\u2014 that is, physical things.

    "question": "What is the relationship between physicalism, panpsychism, and the idea of a world that contains only physical things, like brains?",
    "answer": "Physicalism is the idea that the world can be explained in terms of physical properties and laws. Panpsychism is the idea that every part of the world has some form of mental property or consciousness. If a world that contains only physical things, like brains, is infinitely decomposable, then panpsychism may be incompatible with physicalism, because it may be difficult to reconcile the idea that every part of the world has mental properties with the idea that the world is purely physical.",
