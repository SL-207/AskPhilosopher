    "paragraph": " Suppose also (1) that the value of x is 100 positive units, (2) that the value of y is 50 negative units, (3) that the value of a is 10 negative units, and ( 4) that the value of b is 40 positive units. If so, then the value of the conjunction of x and a is 90 positive units ( 100 positive and 10 negative units), that of the conjunction of y and b 10 negative units (50 negative and 40 positive units). The conjunction of x and a therefore has greater positive value than that of y and b, and the total value of x is greater than that of y. The assignment of positive and negative units of value to states of affairs has been done only for the sake of convenience in illustrating the suggested method of determining which of two states of affairs, x and y, would have greater total value when x has greater intrinsic value than 38 The Nature of Value y and y greater extrinsic value than x. From the fact that the assignment of units of value to states of affairs has the convenience indicated it does not follow that their value can in fact be measured in terms of such units. Such value, whether it be intrinsic or extrinsic, positive or nega\u00ad tive, cannot in fact be measured in terms of such units. There is not, nor can there be, a calculus of value, if by this be meant a process that mea\u00ad sures in numerical terms the value of various states of affairs. It is true that people sometimes say that one thing, x, is twice or three times as valuable as another thing, y. Such language is appropriate if what its use is intended to indicate is the economic or monetary value of the things in question. The economic or monetary value of one thing, x, is twice or three times that of another thing, y, if people are willing to pay twice or three times as much money to obtain x as they are willing to pay to obtain y. But economic or monetary value is one thing, intrinsic value another, and from the fact that people are willing to pay twice or three times as much money to obtain x as they are willing to pay to obtain y it does not follow that the intrinsic value of x is twice or three times as great as that of y.",
