    "paragraph": " Given the preceding, and given also that people generally want others to regard them as good in various respects regardless of whether in fact they are, they have a motive for endeavoring to inhibit outward mani\u00ad festations of various vices manifested inwardly in their secret thoughts, feelings, and desires. People generally want to seem to others to be good regardless of whether in fact they are. They want the approval and praise of others regardless of whether they merit it. The desire to be regarded by others as good and to be a pp roved of and praised is inde\u00ad pendent of, although connected with, the desire not to suffer various of the consequences that might follow were they regarded by others as bad. People frequently want to be regarded as good by others regardless of whether they believe that they will suffer in some way if they are regarded as bad. This can be put by saying that frequently we want to be regarded as good by others as an end, not merely as a means of avoiding suffering in some way at the hands of others because they think us bad. It is as though in seeking to be regarded as good by others as an end we value being good, which is not something we should do were_ we to endeavor to be regarded by others as good merely as a means of avoiding suffering. That we do sometimes fear that others will inflict some form of suffering on us does, however, give us an additional Persons, Things, and Value 105 motive for striving to be regarded as good regardless of whether in fact we are. From motives such as these vice seeks darkness, virtue sunlight. Wanting others to think us good, the motive we have for hiding our vices from others is not a motive for concealing from others our virtues. Because of this, our vices are frequently more likely than our virtues to manifest themselves only inwardly, unaccompanied by any outward manifestation. We sometimes seek to hide our vices from ourselves as well as from others.",
