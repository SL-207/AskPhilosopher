    "paragraph": " Given what we know about the actual world, limited as our knowledge of it admittedly is, the positive intrinsic value of the latter seems to be Moral and Non-Moral Value 89 greater than the negative intrinsic value of the former. This is doubtless one reason most of us like the actual world, taken as a whole, and are in no hurry to leave it. If the preceding is correct, the existence of the actual world, taken as a whole, seems to be intrinsically good, even when the existence of nat\u00ad ural and moral evils is taken into account. From this, however, it does not follow that it is as good as it would be were it to contain less nat\u00ad ural and moral evil. It therefore does not follow that it is the best of all possible worlds. Even though no human being, nor all human beings taken together, has the knowledge, power, or goodness necessary to transform it into the best of all possible worlds, each of us does have the power to make it somewhat better than it is by acting to eliminate, lessen, and prevent various natural evils and to right various moral wrongs. As long as human beings continue to exist, it seems unlikely, given the past history and the present state of the world, that a time will ever come when such action is no longer necessary. As was argued above, such action is itself intrinsically good even though at times, because of the limitations of our knowledge, it be extrinsically bad. Indeed, it might well with some plausibility be argued that at least part of the purpose or meaning of human life is that our being human enables us to increase at least to some extent the amount of positive intrinsic value in the world. Unless we ourselves endeavor so to do, our complaints that God has not created the best of all possible worlds, or even a world somewhat better than the actual world, seem hypocritical, since we ourselves would then fail to act as He would act were he incar\u00ad nate in human form and thus subject to various of the limitations of knowledge and power, although not of moral goodness, to which we are heir.",
