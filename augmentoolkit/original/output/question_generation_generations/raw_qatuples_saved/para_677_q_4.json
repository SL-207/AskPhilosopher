    "paragraph": " 3. Moral and Non-Moral Education Two opposing views, however, can be taken toward the education col\u00ad leges and universities have a duty to offer their students. One of these views I shall call the non-moral or amoral view, the other the moral view. On the first view colleges and universities fulfill their duty to their students and to the wider community by offering their students what in effect is an essentially non-moral education. On the second view they can fulfill their duty only by offering their students a moral education. As the secularization of society and education has progressed in the past several decades, the first view has come to be more widely held, perhaps more widely held today than the second view, which in earlier generations and centuries was the majority view, with the result that colleges and universities increasingly are offering their students only a non-moral education. The difference between a moral and a non-moral education corresponds to the distinction between the complete good on the one hand and having goods on the other. What the proponents of the non-moral view of education in effect are proposing, although they doubtless do not realize it fully, is that colleges and universities offer their students a one-sided education designed only to enable them to acquire goods of various sorts. On this one-sided view of education, colleges and universities have no duty to provide their students an ed\u00ad ucation designed to help them become good persons. The moral view, on the other hand, is not one-sided in what may be referred to as the Stoic direction, since it does not hold that the only duty of colleges and universities is to help their students become good persons. It holds in\u00ad stead that their duty is to offer their students an education that will help them realize their complete good by providing them an education that will not only help them acquire various goods but also become good persons.",
