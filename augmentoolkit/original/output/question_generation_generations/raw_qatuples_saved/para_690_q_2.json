    "paragraph": " Given the argument of the previous chapters, I hope it will not seem too dogmatic if here I say simply that the trouble with this view is that it is false. There are many moral truths that many of us know. A second view, allied to the first, is that it is not part of the duty of colleges and universities to teach values. Those who hold this view usu\u00ad ally do so for either or both of two reasons. The first is that values, whether they be moral or non-moral, are subjective, so that beliefs about non-moral values, like beliefs about moral values, are neither true nor false. This reason, however, is not sufficient to support the view in question, for essentially the same reason that the view that moral beliefs are neither true nor false is unacceptable. Those who argue against teaching any values at all, whether they be moral or non-moral, are also confronted with a serious self-defeating predicament that does not confront those who argue only against teaching moral values. The latter group can simply refrain from teaching any moral values at all. The other group, however, must make certain value judgments in deciding what to have their students read and study in the courses they 208 The Nature of Value teach. Professors of literature, for example, want their students to read good literature worth reading, not bad literature not worth reading. Even professors of mathematics and of various natural sciences want their students to learn good mathematics and science worth learning, not bad mathematics or science not worth learning. In deciding on what and what not to have our students study in the courses we teach we inescapably make value judgments. A second reason sometimes given in support of the view that values ought not to be taught is suggested by tne frequently posed question: Whose values? The supposition on which this question rests is that there is insufficient agreement about values to justify teaching certain values as opposed to others.",

    "answer": "The concern expressed by the question \"Whose values?\" is that there may not be sufficient agreement about values to justify teaching certain values as opposed to others. The assumption that it rests on is that values are subjective and therefore relative to individual perspectives or cultures.",
