    "paragraph": " Precisely similar considerations apply also to first-order dislikings. I can dislike something ( 1) without regarding it as good or bad, (2) while regarding it as bad, and also even ( 3) while regarding it as good. I can dislike a particular painting ( 1) without regarding it as good or as bad, (2) while regarding it as bad, and ev_en ( 3) while regarding it as good, in the latter case perhaps because I defer to the judgment of those I believe to be more knowl\u00ad edgeable than I about painting. In such cases of deference I do not see that what I regard as good is good but instead defer to the judgment of Value and Psychological Phenomena 7 those I take to be more knowledgeable_ than I whom I believe do see that what I regard as good even though I dislike it is in fact good. The likings, dislikings, and valuings proper discussed in the preceding paragraph are all first-order phenomena. Second-order phenomena come on the scene only when first-order phenomena are themselves liked, disliked, evaluated, or regarded as good or as bad. The objects of first-order phenomena consist of anything, other than first-order phe\u00ad nomena themselves, that is liked, disliked, valued, or evaluated, whereas all objects of second-order phenomena are first-order likings, dislikings, valuings, or evaluations. Some creatures (perhaps all dumb animals) that have likes and dislikes are incapable of liking, disliking, valuing, or evaluating their likings and dislikings. To be capable of doing the latter one must be able to objectify one's likings and dislikings as objects of consciousness for oneself. This is something that normal adult human beings can do. Thus I, liking to look at the victims of an accident, might come to be ashamed of my liking to do this. In being ashamed of my first-order liking, I dislike the latter. My being ashamed is therefore a second-order phenomenon, since its object is the first\u00ad order phenomenon of my liking to look at the accident victims.",

    "question": "What is an example of a situation where you might dislike something but still think it's good because others more knowledgeable than you think so?",
    "answer": "An example is when you defer to the judgment of others who you believe are more knowledgeable than you. For instance, you might dislike a particular painting but still think it's good because art critics you respect think so.",
