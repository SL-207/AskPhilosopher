    "paragraph": " Given all this, the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness cannot be defined adequately in terms of the con\u00ad cepts of liking and disliking. Nor can the first pair of concepts be defined adequately in terms of the concept of valuing proper. In such valuings something other than the valuings themselves is regarded as being good or bad. In valuing a thing, it is the thing itself, not our valuing it, that we regard as being good or bad. Although we can evaluate and value various valuings of things by ourselves and others and regard them as being good or bad, such evaluations and valuings of valuings are second-order phenomena that have as their intentional objects the corresponding first-order valu\u00ad ings. Such second-order phenomena thus presuppose and are parasitic upon the corresponding first-order phenomena, in the sense that if the latter did not occur the former could not occur. Unless things other than evaluations and valuings were regarded as good or bad there could be no evaluating and valuings at all and thus no first-order evaluating and valuings to be evaluated and regarded as good or bad in second-order acts of evaluating and valuing. Moreover, as was also indicated in chapter 1, to evaluate a thing is to attempt to determine whether the thing itself is good, bad, or indifferent independently of the evaluating Definition, Proof, and Knowledge of Intrinsic Value 63 and valuing of it, so that the evaluation of a thing presupposes that the thing evaluated is itself independently good, bad, or indifferent and could not be undertaken in the absence of such a presupposition. Given this, the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness cannot be defined adequately in terms of the concepts of evaluation and valuing. If so, then the first pair of concepts cannot be defined adequately in terms of either of the two major types of psychological phenomena in ques\u00ad tion-they cannot be defined either in terms of liking or disliking or in terms of valuing proper.",
