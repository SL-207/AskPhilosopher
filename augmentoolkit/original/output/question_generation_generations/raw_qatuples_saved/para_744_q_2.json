    "question": "What is the difference between \"naturalistic\" and \"non-evaluative\" concepts in philosophy?",
    "answer": "\"Naturalistic\" concepts refer to concepts that are based on observation and description of the natural world, without any evaluative judgment. On the other hand, \"non-evaluative\" concepts refer to concepts that are not intended to convey any value or evaluation, but may still involve some form of judgment or assessment. While naturalistic concepts aim to describe the world as it is, non-evaluative concepts aim to describe or analyze the world without taking a stance on its value or worth.",
