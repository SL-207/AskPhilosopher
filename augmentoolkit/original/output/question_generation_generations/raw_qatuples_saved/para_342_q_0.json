    "paragraph": " There is a brain that has mental properties, no further specifications required. (Brown 2017, p. 1435) THE CASE Imagine a world that has only one thing, a brain called Alex. On the compositional account of mentality, Alex has mental properties: they have \u201cparts that are dynamically arranged in such a way that they pro- duce mentality for the thing they compose\u201d (Brown 2017, p. 1435). The same point extends to Alex\u2019s parts. They too are brains, which Brown calls \u201cBretts.\u201d These smaller brains are mental beings for the PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 130 same reason Alex is. Each Brett is composed of parts, Charlies, ar- ranged in such a way as to produce Brett\u2019s mentality. And each Charlie is also an even smaller brain, composed of yet smaller brains, Devins, which are also mental beings\u2014and so on infinitely. Brown (2017, p. 1435) calls that world the \u201call-mental and all-physical world\u2014MPW for short.\u201d Physicalism could be true of MPW. That world only contains brains: nothing but brains all the way down. But the brains all have men- tality, so there is also mentality all the way down. Thus, \u00adphysicalism could be true of MPW even though that world contains an infinite \u00addescent of mentality. Evidently, the No Low-Level Mentality con- straint is \u00adincorrect. If so, we need a different solution\u2014a different way to \u00adexplain how physicalism could be true if it turns out that there is no fundamental physical level of reality. DISCUSSION One might be tempted to dismiss Brown\u2019s counterexample on the grounds that physicalism is a thesis about the actual world, not other conceivable worlds. But that would be too quick. For one thing, it is widely accepted that the content of the physicalist thesis is deter- mined partly by its consequences for other conceivable (and possible) worlds. Moreover, as noted above, it has been argued that the actual world could turn out to be, in relevant respects, like MPW.",

    "answer": "The all-mental and all-physical world, MPW, is a hypothetical world where everything is composed of brains, from the smallest units to the largest, and all these brains have mental properties.",
