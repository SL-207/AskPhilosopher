PART III JUSTIFICATION GENERAL BACKGROUND: THE NATURE OF JUSTIFICATION In order to get a handle on the nature of justification, it is helpful to draw some important distinctions. To begin, there are multiple senses of the term \u201cjustification\u201d. Two of the primary ways we might use this term is in reference to either epistemic justification or pragmatic jus- tification. These different kinds of justification are similar in that they have both been traditionally understood in terms of having good rea- sons. However, what counts as a \u201cgood reason\u201d is very different when it comes to these different sorts of justification. The sorts of good rea- sons that matter for epistemic justification are reasons that indicate the truth of a particular proposition. For example, a visual experience as of a cat on the mat can provide epistemic justification for believing that there is a cat on the mat. A natural way of understanding this is that visual experience provides epistemic justification because it is a good reason for thinking that there is a cat on the mat. Put another way, this sort of visual experience is indicative of the truth of the proposition that there is a cat on the mat. In order to see how the sort of good reasons that provide epistemic justification differ from those that provide pragmatic justification, JUSTIFICATION 114 let\u2019s consider an example.",
