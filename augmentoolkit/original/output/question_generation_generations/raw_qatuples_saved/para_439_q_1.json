    "paragraph": " To say that someone\u2019s belief counterfactually depends upon her having some evidence means one or both of two things. First, it can mean that the person wouldn\u2019t have the belief that p if she didn\u2019t have the evidence she does. Second, it can mean that the person would have the belief that p if she does have the evidence. Simply put, the idea is that the person\u2019s belief that p is based upon her evidence when her having that evidence explains why she has the belief or if she were to lack the evidence she has, the lack of evidence would explain why she doesn\u2019t have the belief. THE DEBASING DEMON 77 EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: BASING RELATION; SKEPTICISM One of the newer thought experiments to hit the epistemological scene is the Debasing Demon. Unlike some other demons such as Des- cartes\u2019 demon (see Descartes\u2019 Demon pp. 55\u201360), the debasing demon doesn\u2019t trick you with illusions or anything of that sort. In fact, the de- basing demon doesn\u2019t do anything to take away your good reasons for what you think, nor does it give you misleading evidence of any kind. Instead, the debasing demon makes it so that you don\u2019t believe what you do on the basis of the good reasons you have. In other words, the debasing demon makes it so that even if you have justification for be- lieving various propositions, you don\u2019t justifiedly believe any of them. The debasing demon can make it so that your beliefs aren\u2019t based on your reasons in one of two ways. One way is that the demon makes it so that, unbeknownst to you, some other mental states of yours cause you to believe as you do. For example, say that you read an article that has a very good argument for thinking that epistemology is the most important area of philosophy. As a result of this argument, you believe that epistemology is the most important area of philosophy. In a typical case, you justifiedly believe that epistemology is the most important area of philosophy\u2014you believe this on the basis of good reasons.",
