    "paragraph": " If I want to believe myself that p is true, the reason is likely to be that I want p to be true. It is because I want p to be true that I want to believe that it is true. If, however, I want others to believe that p is true, the reason might well be, not that I want p to be true, but that I want something else, the attainment or acquisi\u00ad tion of which by myself or others I believe will be facilitated if others believe that p is true. Indeed, in certain situations I might well want others to believe that p is true while wanting that p be false. It is unlikely, however, that I will want myself to believe that p is true if I want p to be false. Such a combination of wants, however, does seem to be possible. Thus I might want p to be false but want myself to believe that p is true because I believe that p is more likely to be false if I believe it to be true than if I believe it to be false. This combination of wants might occur because in the past so many of my beliefs I have wanted to be false have turned out to be true that I have come to believe that it is more likely that a proposition I want to be true will in fact be false if I believe it to be true than if I believe it to be false. Although such a belief might be irrational or superstitious, people have held irrational or superstitious beliefs, and the belief in question is one such belief that might be held by someone. Thus wanting p to be false, and believing that p is more likely to be false if I believe it to be true than if I believe it to be false, I come to want not only that p be false but also that I believe it to be true. 142 The Nature of Value If the preceding is correct, then endeavors to deceive do not always consist in attempting to lead someone, either myself or others, to believe ( 1) that some proposition I believe to be true is false or (2) that some proposition I believe to be false is true. Instead, I can endeavor to deceive someone, myself or others, into believing that some proposition I neither believe to be true nor believe to be false is ( 1) true or (2) false.",

    "question": "Can someone want a proposition to be false and still want to believe that it is true? If so, why might this be?",
    "answer": "Yes, someone can want a proposition to be false and still want to believe that it is true. This might be because they believe that their own beliefs about propositions they want to be false have often turned out to be true in the past, and so they now believe that a proposition they want to be true is more likely to be false if they believe it to be true than if they believe it to be false.",
