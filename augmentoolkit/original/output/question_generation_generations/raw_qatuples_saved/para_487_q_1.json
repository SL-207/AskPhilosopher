    "paragraph": " They arrive at this double half position by claiming (as halfers do) that when Beauty first wakes on Monday she should have a 1/2 credence that the coin lands heads (for the same reasons that halfers do), but then they insist, unlike halfers, that \u00adBeauty\u2019s credences after learning it is Monday should not be generated by conditionaliz- ing on her earlier credences. Conditionalization is a Bayesian (prob- ability) norm of about how one should change one\u2019s credences over time. So, double halfers deny that this norm applies to Beauty\u2019s situa- tion when she learns that it is Monday. Each of the three positions has its advantages and disadvantages, so the Sleeping Beauty Problem remains a puzzle without a generally accepted solution.

    "question": "What is conditionalization, and why do double halvers deny that it applies to Beauty's situation when she learns that it is Monday?",
    "answer": "Conditionalization is a Bayesian norm of about how one should change one's credences over time. Double halvers deny that this norm applies to Beauty's situation when she learns that it is Monday because they believe that her credences should be updated in some other way.",
