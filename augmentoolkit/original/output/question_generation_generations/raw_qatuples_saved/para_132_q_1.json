    "paragraph": " In order, then, that I succeed in deceiving myself into believing that a given proposition is true or that a given proposition is false, I must come to believe both that it is false and also that it is true. I cannot, however, believe of any given proposi\u00ad tion both that it is true and also that it is false. I therefore cannot deceive myself, and self-deception is therefore impossible. I think we must agree that a person cannot at the same time believe of a given proposition both that it is true and also that it is false. This is not to deny that it is possible for a person to believe what are in fact contradictory propositions without recognizing that he is doing so. Thus I might believe both of two propositions that are in fact contra\u00ad dictories because one entails some proposition that is the contradictory of some proposition entailed by the other, provided that I do not recog\u00ad nize. that the two propositions entail contradictory propositions or that the entailed propositions are in fact contradictories. Thus I might believe both p and q, which in fact are contradictories because p entails that r is true and q that r is false. I can, however, believe that p and q are The Primacy of Practical Rationality 139 both true only if I do not recognize or _believe that p entails that r is true and q that r is false. If I believe that p entails that r is true and q that r is false and recognize or believe that_ if this is the case p and q cannot both be true, then I cannot believe that both are true. Indeed, it is hard to understand what could be meant by saying that it is possible for a person to believe both of two propositions he believes or recognizes to be contradictories. If so, then it is also hard to see what could be meant by saying that it is possible for a person to believe of a given proposition both that it is true and also that it is false. From the fact, however, that a person cannot believe this of any given proposition, it does not follow that self-deception is impossible.",

    "question": "Can a person believe two propositions that are in fact contradictory, without realizing that they are doing so?",
    "answer": "Yes, a person can believe two propositions that are in fact contradictory, without recognizing the contradiction. This can happen if the two propositions are related in a way that makes them seem consistent, such as if one proposition entails a statement that is the opposite of a statement entailed by the other proposition.",
