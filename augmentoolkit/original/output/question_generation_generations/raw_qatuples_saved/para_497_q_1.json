    "paragraph": " The advocate of such a view might well admit that some things are so greatly good and others so greatly bad that it would be bad if one who had experience or knowledge of them were to like some indifferent thing more than he likes any of these greatly good things or to dislike some indifferent thing more than he dislikes any of these greatly bad things. He might also readily admit that it is difficult in the extreme, if not in fact impossible, to distinguish precisely and unerringly between those things that fall within the classes of greatly Attitudes toward the Indifferent 1 85 good or greatly bad things and thos\u041b that do not. Such admissions, however, are consistent with the view that it can be good to like some indifferent things more than some good things and to dislike other indifferent things more than some bad things. Thus on such a view it can be good that a widow like and treasure more some indifferent bauble given her long ago by her now dead husband than some exquisite diamond necklace willed her by some distant relative. She might well recognize that as pieces of jewelry the necklace has far greater aesthetic value than the bauble she cherishes, as she also might well recognize that it would be unreasonable of her to expect others to like the bauble more than the necklace. She might well realize, that is, that as a piece of jewelry the necklace is exquisitely good, the bauble indifferent. Yet despite this she cherishes the bauble more than the neck\u00ad lace because the former and not the latter was given her long ago by her now dead husband, and on the view in question it is or can be good that she do so. The proponent of the view in question might go further and maintain that it would also be good if our widow liked the necklace more than the bauble. On such a view each of two conflicting attitudes on her part would be good. Her liking the bauble more than the necklace would be good but so also would her liking the necklace more than the bauble.",

    "question": "How might someone reconcile the fact that they like something indifferent more than something good with the idea that the good thing is, in fact, better?",
    "answer": "A person might reconcile this by recognizing that there are different types of value, and that the indifferent thing has value to them due to its sentimental significance, even if it has less value in an objective sense. They might also acknowledge that it would be unreasonable to expect others to share their sentiment.",
