    "paragraph": " Moving the queen still requires movement of the material that makes her up, and if that material is moved, the queen moves. If the relation between mental states and physical states is like this, the mental is involved in the causal story even though it doesn\u2019t insert a novel causal power into the world. This might reduce the force of the exclusion problem for the non-reductive physicalist. To be successful, the non-reductive physicalist\u2019s response will need to satisfy two opposing desiderata: it needs to give the mental some \u201cautonomy,\u201d thus preserving the distinctness of the mental and phys- ical events (and causal relations) while denying the causal power will compete with the causal powers on the physical level. Though this is tricky, there are plenty of plausible attempts to thread this needle. Take an example: \u201cJimmy grabs his umbrella because he believes it is rain- ing.\u201d This seems to give us a case of mental causation\u2014Jimmy\u2019s beliefs and desires cause him to grab his umbrella. The mental part is autono- mous because, although beliefs and desires must all be physically real- ized, the explanation doesn\u2019t depend on the idiosyncrasies of Jimmy\u2019s particular physical make-up\u2014the explanation would be just as true if slightly different neurons were involved or if Jimmy were a robot. What matters is that Jimmy had those beliefs, not that those particu- lar physical processes were involved. Nevertheless, there is no novel causation here, in that the mental causation is underwritten, every step along the way, by physical processes. Or, to put it another way, the mental causation doesn\u2019t compete, in this instance, with the physical causation because of the intimate relationship between the mental PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 74 properties and the physical properties. (There are many variations and twists on this story, but for important versions of the story and some important moves along the way see Fodor 1974, Yablo 1992, Baker 1993, Antony 1991, Pereboom 2002, Bennett 2003, Wilson 1999 and 2002, and Shoemaker 2001.",

    "question": "What is the implication of this scenario for the idea of mental causation?",
    "answer": "The implication of this scenario is that mental causation may not be a fundamentally distinct form of causation. Rather, it may be an emergent property of physical processes that arises from the complex interactions between mental and physical properties.",
