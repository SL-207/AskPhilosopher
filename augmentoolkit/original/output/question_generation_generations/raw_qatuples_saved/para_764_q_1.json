    "paragraph": " I can be envious of another because he is good, or because of his goodness, and such envy can also lead me to hate him. If it does, then I not only envy but also hate him because he is good. My hating another person, however, can be justified, if indeed it can be justified at all, only if he is bad, and the degree to which I can justifiably hate him is determined, at least in part, by the degree to which he is bad. This is at least part of the reason I want the person I hate to be bad. My hatred can be justified only if the person I hate is bad, not if he is good. A given person, John, might be loved by Peter and hated by Paul. Peter and Paul might be in complete agreement as to which properties of a person are virtues and as to which are vices. They might also agree that the virtues are good-making properties of a person, the vices bad\u00ad making properties. Paul, in hating John, also wants him to be bad regardless of whether he believes that he is, whereas Peter, in loving Johm, wants him to be good regardless of whether he believes that he is. In wanting John to be bad, Paul does not want virtues to be vices or vices to be virtues. Nor does Peter want this in wanting John to be good. Paul, in hating John, wants him to have bad-making properties suffi\u00ad cient to make him bad, and Peter, in loving John, wants him to have good-making properties sufficient to make him good. Thus Paul, in hating John, and in wanting him to be bad, wants him to have certain properties that Peter, in loving John and in wanting him to be good, wants him not to have. Paul would agree with Peter that John is good if he believed that John has the properties Peter wants him to have, and Peter would agree with Paul that John is bad if he believed that John has the properties Paul wants him to have. If they disagree as to whether John.is good or bad it is because they disagree concerning which prop\u00ad erties he has.",
