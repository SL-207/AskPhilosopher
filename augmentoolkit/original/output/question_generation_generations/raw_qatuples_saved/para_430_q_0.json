DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-5 3 THE DISEMBODIED PAIN BACKGROUND In the 17th century, French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes developed and defended dualism in works such as Meditations on First Philosophy. In the Sixth Meditation, Descartes argues that we could conceive of the mind existing apart from the body and, since God can bring about whatever we can conceive, it is possible for the mind to exist apart from the body. For two things to be independent substances, all that\u2019s needed is that it be possible for them to exist apart. Thus, Descartes concludes that the mind and body are independent substances, and that dualism must be true. More recently, taking inspiration from this Cartesian discussion, Brie Gertler has put forth a thought experiment about disembodied pain that aims to support a dualist view. Unlike Descartes, Gertler does not rely on the existence of God to support dualism.",
