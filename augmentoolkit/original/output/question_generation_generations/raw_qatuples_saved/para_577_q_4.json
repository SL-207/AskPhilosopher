    "paragraph": " If it were greater its total value would be positive; if it were lesser its total value would be negative. In the first case it would be intrinsically good that such a world exist; in the second it would be intrinsically bad that it exist. Since, however, natural evils not only can but do exist and moral wrongs not only can but do occur, such a world is far removed from our actual world, although not as far removed as the first world. In our actual world natural evils do exist and moral wrongs do occur. In this respect it is intrinsically worse than either of the other two worlds. In another respect, however, it is intrinsically better, since in it acts intended to eliminate or lessen natural evils that do in fact exist and to right moral wrongs that have in fact occurred do occur, whereas in the other two worlds they cannot, and the occurrence of such acts is intrinsically good. The existence of such natural evils and the occur\u00ad rence of such moral wrongs is thus extrinsically good in at least one respect, since their existence and occurrence is necessary if acts intended to eliminate or lessen the former and to right the latter are to occur. Whether the total value of the first state of affairs is positive or negative is determined by whether its negative intrinsic value is greater or less than the positive intrinsic value of the second state of affairs. If it is greater its total value is negative; if it is less its total value is positive. In the first case, however, it does not follow that the intrinsic value of the actual world, taken as a whole, is negative, and in the second it does not follow that its intrinsic value is positive. Whether it is positive or nega\u00ad tive is determined by whether the negative intrinsic value of the total amount of natural and moral evil is greater or less than the positive intririsic value of the total amount of natural and moral goodness.",

    "question": "Why might the intrinsic value of the actual world be different from the total value of the amount of natural and moral evil?",
    "answer": "The intrinsic value of the actual world might be different from the total value of the amount of natural and moral evil because the latter is determined by a comparison of the positive and negative intrinsic values of two separate states of affairs.",
