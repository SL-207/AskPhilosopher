    "paragraph": " Even if the brain generates experience, that is a mere contingent fact; everything about the brain might be just as it is, and yet no experience is generated. If so, then consciousness itself is wholly different from anything physical. To put it another way, since nothing physical can bridge the explana- tory gap, we need to appeal to something non-physical. Otherwise, the connection between consciousness and the physical world will remain forever mysterious. DISCUSSION The hard problem has long been recognized. For example, Thomas Nagel\u2019s 1974 classic \u201cWhat Is It Like to Be a Bat?\u201d begins with the following sentence: \u201cConsciousness is what makes the mind-body problem really intractable.\u201d And in 1866, T. H. Huxley wrote, How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of initiating nerve tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin, where Aladdin rubbed his lamp in the story. Philosophers of earlier eras doubtless understood the problem no less acutely than Chalmers, Nagel, and Huxley do. Even so, work on it has intensified considerably since the publication of Chalmers\u2019s 1995 article, \u201cFacing Up to the Hard Problem of Consciousness,\u201d and his influential 1996 book, The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory. Some regard the hard problem as insoluble. For example, according to Colin McGinn (1989), although there is a naturalistic solution, we humans are \u201ccognitively closed\u201d to it, due to limitations in our \u00adconcept-forming abilities. In his view, we simply cannot form con- cepts that would enable us to see why, for example, undergoing a certain type of brain process must be felt as pain, even if pain were identical to that brain process. Daniel Stoljar (2005) also doubts that we are currently positioned to solve the problem; but, unlike McGinn, CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 22 Stoljar thinks that might change.",

    "question": "Who doubt that the hard problem is solvable, and why?",
    "answer": "Some philosophers, such as Colin McGinn, doubt that the hard problem is solvable because they believe that humans are \"cognitively closed\" to the naturalistic solution due to limitations in our concept-forming abilities. In other words, we simply cannot form concepts that would enable us to understand why undergoing a certain type of brain process must be felt as pain.",
