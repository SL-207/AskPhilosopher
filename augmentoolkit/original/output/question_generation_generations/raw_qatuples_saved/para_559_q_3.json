DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-8 MARY AND THE BLACK-AND- WHITE ROOM BACKGROUND If physicalism is true, then all information is physical information. What exactly \u201cphysical\u201d means is a matter of dispute; but many agree on two things. First, physical information is information of the sort revealed by science. Second, information revealed by science is ob- jective: understanding it requires intelligence but not specific sensory capacities. Thus, in principle, a colorblind person could understand any physical truth no less than a color-sighted person could, even if the physical truth in question concerns color perception. If all infor- mation is objective, physical information, then a complete physical description of the world would leave nothing out. Frank Jackson\u2019s knowledge argument suggests that such a description would leave out information about consciousness. THE CASE Imagine a time far in the future when the complete physical truth about the world has been discovered. Physics, chemistry, neuroscience, etc.",

    "question": "What does the concept of physicalism imply about the nature of subjective experience, such as consciousness?",
    "answer": "The concept of physicalism suggests that subjective experience, such as consciousness, is not a part of a complete physical description of the world. This is because physicalism implies that all information is physical information, and subjective experience is not considered to be physical information.",
