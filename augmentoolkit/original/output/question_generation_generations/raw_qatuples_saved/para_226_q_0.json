DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-22 ELOISE AND THE TREE BACKGROUND Many of our mental states have intentional content. Intentionality in the relevant sense doesn\u2019t have to do with having an intention or doing something intentionally, but rather with representational content. The notion is often characterized in terms of \u201caboutness\u201d or \u201cdirectedness.\u201d For example, my belief that Mike Trout plays for the Los Angeles Angels is about a particular person, Mike Trout, and a certain state of affairs\u2014his playing for that particular baseball team. My belief represents, or is directed at, those things.",

    "question": "What is the concept of \"intentionality,\" and how is it characterized?",
    "answer": "Intentionality is a concept that refers to the representational content of mental states. It's characterized as \"aboutness\" or \"directedness,\" meaning that mental states have a certain content or meaning that they are representing or directed at. For example, a belief about Mike Trout playing for the Los Angeles Angels has intentionality because it represents or is directed at a particular person (Mike Trout) and a certain state of affairs (his playing for that team).",
