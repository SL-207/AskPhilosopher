    "paragraph": " Here\u2019s why. Assume that unbeknownst to him, Stew\u2019s color vision really is reliable and the cards really look the way that he thinks. So, when a card looks red to him it\u2019s because it\u2019s red, when it looks blue it\u2019s because the card is blue, and so on. According to basic knowledge structure theories, Stew can know that a card is red because it looks red (he doesn\u2019t need to know that his color vision is reliable in order to know this). As a result, when Stew looks at the LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 96 first card, he knows it\u2019s red. Basic knowledge structure theories also allow that Stew can know about how things look to him via intro- spection without first knowing that introspection is reliable. Hence, when Stew thinks about it, he knows that the card looks red to him. From these two items of knowledge, Stew can easily deduce that he was correct with respect to the first card: it looks red to Stew and it is red, so Stew got it right. The same applies to all of the other cards. Now, after going through enough cards, Stew has a sufficient amount of evidence for coming to know that his color vision is reliable. Thus, it seems that basic knowledge structure theories are committed to claiming that Stew can come to know that his color vision is reliable in this sort of way. However, intuitively this sort of \u201cbootstrapping\u201d process can\u2019t allow one to come to know that one\u2019s vision (or any other cognitive faculty) is reliable. The sort of case described in this entry was first put forward as an objection to reliabilist theories of justification/knowledge (see Gen- eral Background: The Nature of Justification pp. 113\u2013119). These theories say roughly that one only needs to have reliable faculties in order to have knowledge from those faculties. In other words, one doesn\u2019t have to have any reason to think that one\u2019s faculties are reliable in order to gain knowledge from those faculties. So, one initial response to these sorts of cases was that they show that reliabilism is false (Fumerton 1995, Vogel 2000).",

    "question": "What is the problem with the idea that Stew can come to know that his color vision is reliable through this \"bootstrapping\" process?",
    "answer": "The problem is that intuitively, this process seems to involve a kind of circular reasoning. Stew is trying to know that his color vision is reliable by using his color vision to gather evidence, but he can't be sure that his color vision is reliable until he knows that it is.",
