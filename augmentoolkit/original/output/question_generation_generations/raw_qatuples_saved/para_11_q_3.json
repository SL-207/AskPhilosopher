    "question": "What is the significance of Quine's idea of \"indeterminacy of translation\"?",
    "answer": "The significance of Quine's idea of \"indeterminacy of translation\" is that it suggests that there may be multiple, equivalent ways to translate a language, and that the meaning of a word or sentence is not fixed or determinate in any one way. This challenges traditional notions of meaning and translation.",
