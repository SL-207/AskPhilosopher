    "paragraph": " From the fact, therefore, that various things are good or bad in either or both of the senses in question it does not follow that nothing is intrinsically good or bad. 3 Still another way in which the egoist might attempt to eliminate the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness is to replace them with the concepts of liking and disliking. One need not be an egoist if one is to replace the first pair of concepts with the second pair. If, however, the first pair of concepts can in fact be successfully replaced by the second, then arguments against egoism that use the concept of intrinsic good\u00ad ness and badness cannot succeed. The question therefore arises of whether the first pair of concepts can in fact be replaced successfully by the second. On the view in question, no liking or disliking, and nothing liked or disliked, is intrinsically good or bad, so that no liking or disliking, and nothing liked or disliked, can be intrinsically better or worse than any other liking or disliking and than anything else liked or disliked. Instead, each liking and disliking, and each thing liked or disliked, is in itself indifferent. On such a view likings and dislikings, and things liked and disliked, take the place of, and have the same function as, intrinsi\u00ad cally good and bad things. Rather than things being extrinsically good or bad because of their relationships to intrinsically good and bad things, they are extrinsically good or bad because of their relationships to likings and dislikings and to things liked or disliked. And rather than preferences, choices, and acts being rational or irrational because of their relationships to intrinsically good and bad things, they are rational 168 The Nature of Value or irrational because of their relationships to likings and dislikings and to things like or disliked. One of the major difficulties confronting such a view, as was sug\u00ad gested in the first chapter, is that not only things liked and disliked, but also likings and dislikings, can be intrinsically good or bad, depending upon the nature of whatever it is that is liked or disliked.",

    "answer": "I believe that this idea is problematic, because it seems to contradict the possibility that likings and dislikings, and things liked and disliked, can have inherent value or disvalue.",
