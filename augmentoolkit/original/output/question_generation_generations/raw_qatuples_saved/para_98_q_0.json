    "paragraph": " Lewis recognizes the difficulty. Indeed, he illustrates it by \u00adconsidering a phenomenon that initially seems no less possible than pain experi- enced by Maddy or Marty: pain experienced by a creature who is mad (like Maddy), physiologically alien (like Marty), and unique (like neither Maddy nor Marty). Analytic functionalism can\u2019t explain how mad, alien, unique pain is possible. Because this creature is mad, the state realizing their pain doesn\u2019t play the relevant causal role. \u00adBecause they are alien, they do not have c-fiber stimulation\u2014the state that plays that role in humans. And, because they are unique, their state doesn\u2019t realize pain in other members of their species: their species has no other members! Lewis concludes that such a case is impossi- ble, despite initial appearances to the contrary. That intuitive cost, he suggests, is outweighed by other benefits of his theory. Even so, the case helps bring out the oddity of the view that whether an individual creature feels pain depends on their relationship to other members of their species. Martian pain illustrates a doctrine known as the multiple realizability of the mental (Putnam 1967, Bickle 2020). A given mental kind, such as pain, can be realized in (or constituted by) many distinct kinds: brain states in humans, other biological states in non-human animals, perhaps hydraulic states in Martians, silicon or electronic states in some digital computers, and maybe even non-physical states in ghosts. Many, including Lewis, take accounting for multiple realizability as an important goal for a theory of mind (Putnam 1967, Kripke 1972). But some philosophers are more skeptical (Polger and Shapiro 2016). Mad pain has received less attention, though some\u2014including some \u00adanalytic functionalists\u2014have expressed skepticism about that too (Shoemaker 1981).

    "question": "Why can't analytic functionalism explain pain experienced by a creature who is mad, alien, and unique?",
    "answer": "Analytic functionalism cannot explain pain experienced by a creature who is mad, alien, and unique because this creature's state does not play the relevant causal role in their experience of pain. The creature is mad, so their state does not realize pain in the way that it does in humans. They are alien, so they do not have the same c-fiber stimulation that humans experience as pain. And, because they are unique, their state does not realize pain in other members of their species, since their species has no other members.",
