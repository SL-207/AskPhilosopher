    "paragraph": " Though it\u2019s true there is a sense in which one perceives something by perceiving its properties, questions remain. Suppose you are sitting The Elusive Self 287 in a coffee shop and hear music playing. You believe there must be a beatnik with a guitar, playing on the patio. In fact, a record is playing. Are you perceiving the record? You are plausibly perceiving some of its properties\u2014the sound it contains, etc. But the record itself is elu- sive. The defender of the elusiveness thesis could say the same thing about the self\u2014one is perceiving the properties of the self, but those properties don\u2019t make the subject itself a salient object of perception (Howell 2023). Turning from the epistemological claim to the metaphysical one, could it really be that there is no self? One might argue that there simply cannot be experiences without something that has those ex- periences. Experiences have to be had by something; there cannot be a thought without a thinker. While this is compelling to many, others are suspicious. In the early 19th century, Lichtenberg claimed that when Descartes gave his cogito, ergo sum argument, he was not justified in concluding there is an I\u2014a thing that thinks (2012). All we can conclude based on introspection is that there are thoughts\u2014not that there is a thing thinking those thoughts. Here Lichtenberg invokes an analogy. Just as we can say \u201cIt is raining\u201d without there being a thing that is doing the raining, we can say \u201cThere is thinking\u201d without con- cluding there is a thing that is thinking. It is not clear that Lichtenberg\u2019s challenge succeeds. As Roderick Chisholm (1969) argues, it would seem that the selfless view is com- mitted to thinking that we can substitute \u201cThere is\u201d for \u201cI\u201d\u2014that is, we can translate I-sentences into impersonal sentences. There is a problem with this, however. When I say \u201cI have a headache\u201d and you say \u201cI do not have a headache,\u201d we can both be right\u2014these claims do not contradict one another.",

    "question": "What is the problem with the idea that experiences must be had by something that has those experiences?",
    "answer": "The problem with this idea is that it may be possible to say \"There is thinking\" without concluding that there is a thing that is thinking. This is because, just as we can say \"It is raining\" without there being a thing that is doing the raining, we can say \"There is thinking\" without concluding that there is a thing that is thinking.",
