    "paragraph": " Since the statue and the\u00a0clay are distinct entities, do they together weigh 20 pounds? No, the clay\u2019s weight just is the statue\u2019s weight, because the clay consti- tutes the statue. Similarly, the human animal\u2019s mind just is the person\u2019s mind, because the human animal constitutes the person. Another response is to embrace the multiplicity of thinkers while denying that this is a problem. For example, C. S. Sutton (2014) argues that properties of objects related in a certain way are non- summative\u2014essentially, they don\u2019t \u201cadd up\u201d in the way you would oth- erwise expect. So, in his example, if your body weighs 150 pounds and your arm weighs 9, you wouldn\u2019t expect the scale to read 159 pounds when you stepped on it\u2014even though your body and your arm are both being weighed. The 9 pounds of your arm is part of the 150 pounds of your body. The same is true of the many minds in my chair. \u00adPerhaps they aren\u2019t identical. But they are made up of the same stuff, and so their properties\u2014the number of thoughts, for example\u2014are The Puzzle of Too Many Minds 271 non-summative. As Luke Roelofs (2022) points out, this does have the consequence that two thinkers can share thoughts. While this might seem to conflict with the privacy of the mental, perhaps this isn\u2019t so worrisome given the overlapping nature of the subjects in question.

    "answer": "If multiple minds are non-summative in terms of their properties, it would mean that the number of thoughts or other mental properties are not additive.",
