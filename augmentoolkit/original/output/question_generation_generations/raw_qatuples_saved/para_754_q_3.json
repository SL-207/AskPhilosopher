    "paragraph": " We can easily imagine a unicorn despite never seeing one, simply by conjoining our ideas of a horse and a horn. Color theory tells us that colors are not simples, but are combinations of hue, value, and saturation. Perhaps a Humean can make use of this idea to resolve the puzzle\u2014the missing shade of blue is built up out of ideas of hue, value, and saturation that correspond to experiences the subject has had. It\u2019s not clear, though, that the puzzle can\u2019t be recast, involving missing saturations, hues, or values. Further, even if the complexity of color experience does help, it cannot help Hume himself, since he seemed to believe particular color shades were simples (Hume 1740/1978, p. 637). Nevertheless, even if one believes that ideas and impressions of par- ticular shades of color are simple, this doesn\u2019t rule out the existence of resemblance relations between them. These resemblance relations give us a grasp of the missing shade of blue. Though we can\u2019t trace an idea of that shade to a particular impression of that shade, we can explain it in respectable (and Humean) empiricist terms. We can trace it to our impressions of other colors and the resemblances between them (Fo- gelin 1984, Garrett 1997). This might also help address the concern about Hume\u2019s skeptical arguments regarding the ideas of substance, necessary connection, etc. Perhaps those ideas can also be explained in respectable, empiricist terms. But how to do this is not obvious. For example, unlike the case of color, the necessary connection between causal relata not only doesn\u2019t stem from a simple impression, but also doesn\u2019t stem merely from resemblances among simple impressions. The missing shade of blue is not just of historical interest. The issue has arisen in recent debates about phenomenal concepts. Phenomenal concepts are concepts of the particular \u201cwhat it\u2019s likeness\u201d of conscious states, and they seem deeply tied to our having those conscious states (Stoljar 2005; see also Chapters 6 and 8).",
