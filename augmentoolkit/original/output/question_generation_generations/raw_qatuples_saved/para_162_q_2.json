    "paragraph": " Some critics of the Turing Test accuse it of having a humancentric bias. Why should the imitation of human thought be considered an appropriate standard for thought in general? In response, however, we can point to the fact that Turing was not trying to define thinking; nor was he saying that passing the Turing Test was necessary for a machine to count as thinking. Rather, he was simply offering a sufficient con- dition for the attribution of thought to a machine. But, even though we can dismiss this criticism, a related criticism proposed by Robert French (1990) has more bite. Suppose we were trying to figure out whether some machine we were building should count as flying. Of course, not everything that travels through air counts as flying\u2014consider soap bubbles. So, it might prove difficult to come up with a precise definition of flying. To avoid the problem, we decide to use the Seagull Test: If our machine can fool someone looking at a radar screen into thinking that they are seeing a seagull in flight, then the machine counts as flying. Passing the Seagull Test is thus sufficient for an entity to count as flying. The Seagull Test does well with respect to bullets and bubbles, both of which will be easily distinguished from seagulls on radar. But it does less well with heli- copters, airplanes, bats, and hummingbirds. Since all of these things will also be easily distinguished from seagulls on radar, the Seagull Test will not be able to deliver the result that they count as flying. The standard it sets is far too high. Yes, something that is indistinguishable from a seagull on radar should count as flying; but there are far too many things that should count as flying that won\u2019t be indistinguish- able from seagulls, and so, for practical purposes, the Seagull Test is The Imitation Game 101 useless. French wants to say something similar about the Turing Test. Yes, something that is indistinguishable from a human in conversation should count as thinking; but there are far too many things that should count as thinking that won\u2019t be indistinguishable from humans, and so, for practical purposes, the Turing Test is useless.",

    "question": "Can you give an example of a test that is similar to the Turing Test, but is criticized for being too narrow or too high a standard?",
    "answer": "Yes, the Seagull Test is an example of a test that is similar to the Turing Test. It is a test for determining whether something counts as flying, but it is criticized for being too high a standard because it requires the entity to be indistinguishable from a seagull on radar, which is not a realistic or useful criterion for determining whether something is flying.",
