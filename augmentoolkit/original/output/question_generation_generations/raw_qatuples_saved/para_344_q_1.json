    "paragraph": " 12 DESCARTES\u2019 DREAM (DREAMING\u00a0SKEPTICISM) Background: In the previous entry we saw one of Descartes\u2019 most famous skeptical scenarios. Here we will look at his other famous skeptical scenario. Although both scenarios are taken to pose a threat to our knowledge of the external world, some philosophers have argued that the way that do so is importantly different from one another. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: CARTESIAN/ EXTERNAL WORLD SKEPTICISM; DREAMING SKEPTICISM Have you ever had a dream that seemed so real that while it was happening, you weren\u2019t aware that it was a dream? You may be famil- iar with this sort of dream\u2014it seems so real that for a few moments when you wake up you are a bit disoriented. After such a dream, it takes you a few moments to figure out that you are now awake and what had seemed so real was actually a dream. Perhaps you\u2019ve never had such a dream, but presumably you can still imagine what this would be like. If you\u2019ve had such a dream (or even if you are just im- agining having such a dream), Descartes asks us to consider: do you know that you aren\u2019t having such a dream right now? How can you be sure? Granted, you might think that a dream would be a tad more LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 62 exciting than reading this epistemology book (though what could be more exciting than epistemology?!). But, couldn\u2019t a dream be realistic in the sense of not including you having unnatural abilities or doing anything spectacular? Is it possible (in the broad sense of the term)\u2014 however unlikely\u2014that you could have a dream in which everything seems exactly the way it does when you are awake? Descartes noticed that when it comes to beliefs about the external world, it could be that it seems to you that you are reading a book when in fact you are lying in your bed sleeping the night away. If things could look, feel, etc. the way they do now but you are actually dreaming, how can you know that you are awake rather than having a vivid dream?",
