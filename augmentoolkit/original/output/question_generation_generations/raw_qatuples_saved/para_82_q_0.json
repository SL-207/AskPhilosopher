Instead of requiring that the fact that p causes one\u2019s belief that p, reliabilism as it pertains to knowl- edge holds, roughly, that in order to know that p one\u2019s true belief that p must be caused by (be the output of) a reliable belief forming pro- cess (a process that tends to produce more true beliefs than false ones). CAUSAL THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 15 Reliabilism seems to be able to get the correct result in this case as well. Skyrms\u2019 belief that the person is dead seems to be reliable. After all, believing that someone is dead because you see that their head has been severed seems like a very reliable way of forming true beliefs about whether or not someone is dead.
