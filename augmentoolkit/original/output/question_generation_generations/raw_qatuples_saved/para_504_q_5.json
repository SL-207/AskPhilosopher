    "paragraph": " Although she cannot like each more than the other, she can like either more than the other, and, regardless of which of the two she likes more than the other, her liking it more than the other would be good. If so, then not only can one person's preferring a good thing, a, to an indif\u00ad ferent thing, b, and another person's preferring b to a both be good, but also one and the same person's preferring a to b and also his preferring b to a, whichever of the two is the case, can both be good. Moreover, each of the two persons can like the liking or preference of the other even though it is contrary to his own. Thus the person who likes a more than b can like the other's liking b more than a, and the person who likes b more than a can like the other's liking a more than b. Indeed, given that each knows of the other's liking or preference, and given also that the liking or preference of each is good, the liking by each of the liking of the other is also good. In fact, given that the liking or prefer\u00ad ence of each is good, either's indifference toward or disliking the liking of the other would be bad.

It is there\u00ad fore good not only to tolerate but also to like the contrary good likings of others and bad not only to dislike or to be indifferent toward them but also to be intolerant toward them. Such tolerance is the natural issue of such liking, such intolerance the natural issue of such disliking. Such liking and tolerance manifest a generous disposition, such dis\u00ad liking and intolerance a narrow mind. It might be objected that the bauble of our example is not in fact indifferent and thus that our example i\u041c not an instance of someone's liking something indifferent more than something good.",
