    "paragraph": " There are two major ways in which an approach can be made to real\u00ad izing the goal of the non-moral view of education. One is through pro\u00ad viding students a vocational or professional education that will enable them to earn more money over the course of their lives than they other\u00ad wise would probably be able to do and thereby to acquire greater quan\u00ad tities of goods of various kinds than they otherwise could acquire. The The Complete Human Good and Higher Education 207 second way is through providing a liberal education or through supple\u00ad menting a vocational education with courses in the liberal arts and sci\u00ad ences. In this way students might acquire a greater understanding and appreciation of various of the liberal arts and sciences than they other\u00ad wise would have. The goal of the non-moral view of education is there\u00ad fore realized to the degree to which students are enabled to acquire two goods of some importance-the wealth to acquire various of the kinds of goods money can buy and an increased knowledge and appreciation of various of the liberal arts and sciences. These are doubtless goods it is good to have. But, as was argued above, to be financially well off and educated is one thing, to be a good person another. On the non-moral view of education it is not part of the duty of colleges and universities to help its students become good persons. This is the duty of their par\u00ad ents and/or of their church, if they have a church, or perhaps of some other institution. But it is not the duty of colleges and universities. This view of education is related to certain other views. One is the view that there is no such thing as moral knowledge. Since the duty of colleges and universities is only to do what they can to increase the knowledge of their students, and since there is no such thing as moral knowledge, it cannot be part of their duty to increase the moral knowl\u00ad edge of their students.",
