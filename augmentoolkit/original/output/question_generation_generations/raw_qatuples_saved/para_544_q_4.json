    "paragraph": " Moreover, the special relation in which a person stands to an indifferent thing that leads to his liking it need not be direct, as is that in which the widow stands to the bauble. It might instead be indirect. Thus a son of the widow, who knows that she cherishes the bauble because it was given her by his father, might also come to cherish it. In such a case the special relation in which he stands to it that leads to his 1 90 The Nature of Value treasuring it is indirect, since he treasures it because she treasures it. If, however, he were to cherish it because it was given her by his father, and not because she treasures it, the special relation in which he stands to it would be direct. This relation would be even more obviously direct if he were to treasure it because his father gave it to her even though she does not cherish it and he knows that she does not. This can be put more gen\u00ad erally by saying that the special relation in which a person stands to an indifferent thing he likes is ( 1 ) direct if he likes it independently of its being liked by anyone else, (2) indirect.if he likes it because someone else who stands in a special relation to it likes it. 5. Egocentrism, Anthropocentrism, and Magnanimity We are more likely to like an indifferent thing liked by another and to like his liking it if we stand in some special relation to him, such as friendship or kinship, than if we do not. In order, however, that we like another's liking an indifferent thing it is not necessary that we also like the thing he likes. Indeed, we might well like another's liking some indifferent thing even though we dislike the thing he likes. One of the marks of a generous disposition is that we like not only another's liking the things we like but also another's liking various indifferent things we are indifferent toward or dislike. Other things being equal, we are more magnanimous if we like the latter likings of others as well as the former than if we like the former but not also the latter.",

    "question": "How does the level of generosity of a person's disposition relate to their liking of others' likings of indifferent things?",
    "answer": "Other things being equal, you are more magnanimous if you like the latter likings of others as well as the former than if you like the former but not also the latter. This means that the more generous your disposition is, the more likely you are to like others' likings of indifferent things, even if you do not like those things yourself.",
