    "paragraph": " This is to say that it is the goodness or badness of facts, in the second sense of \"fact,\" that determines whether it is good or bad ( 1) that some purported fact, in the third sense of the term, is in fact a fact and (2) that a given proposi\u00ad tion is true (or false). Thus the ground of its being good (1) that John is honest and (2) that the proposition that John is honest is true is the goodness of the obtaining of the state of affairs consisting of John's being honest. The preceding is an account only of the ground of its being good ( or bad) ( 1 ) that some purported fact, in the third sense of the term, is in fact a fact and (2) that some proposition is in fact true (or false). It is not an account of the ground of the goodness or badness of facts in the first and second senses of \"fact\". It is not, that is, an account of the ground of the goodness or badness of either ( 1 ) any state of affairs that obtains or (2) the obtaining or the non-obtaining of any state of affairs. As was indi\u00ad cated above, the ground of the goodness or badness of the obtaining or the non-obtaining of a state of affairs is the nature of the state of affairs that does or does not obtain. We have left unanswered the question of whether states of affairs themselves, taken completely in abstraction from any consideration of whether they do or do not obtain, can be ei\u00ad ther good or bad. If they can be, then it is their nature that determines not only the goodness or badness of their obtaining or their not ob\u00ad taining but also their own goodness or badness, taken in abstraction from their obtaining or their not obtaining. If they cannot be, then the question of what the ground of their own goodness or badness is does not arise. Ontological Categories and Bearers of Value 29 4. Abstracta and Concreta as Bearers of Value The question of whether states of affairs themselves, taken in complete abstraction from any consideration of whether they do or do not obtain, can be good or bad is analogous to the question of whether uni\u00ad versals themselves, taken completely in abstraction from any consider\u00ad ation of whether they are exemplified by particulars, can be either good or bad.",

    "answer": "This is an open question. If states of affairs can be good or bad in abstraction from their obtaining or non-obtaining, then it is their nature that determines their goodness or badness. If they cannot be good or bad in abstraction from their obtaining or non-obtaining, then the question of what determines their goodness or badness does not arise.",
