    "paragraph": " 1 To avoid such inconsistency in terminology, it seems better to refer to attempts to define evaluative concepts in terms of non-evaluative con\u00ad cepts as non-evaluative definitions. Such terminology expresses more clearly what those who define evaluative concepts in terms of non-eval\u00ad uative ones are attempting to do, which is to reduce evaluative concepts to concepts that are not evaluative, regardless of whether the latter be concepts of sensible \"natural\" properties or of supersensible \"non\u00ad natural\" properties. It might also be mentioned in this connection that in at least certain contexts two other forms of frequently used terminology can be mis\u00ad leading. One is the terminology of \"fact/value,\" the other that of \"is/ought\". The first is misleading if it suggests or is meant to suggest that value judgments do not or cannot state facts and therefore are not or cannot be true or false. If any judgment is true and states a fact, the judgment that instances of unmerited suffering are intrinsically bad would certainly seem to be true-and to state a fact. Such a fact is a value fact. Such facts differ from those facts that are not value facts, such as the fact that John is suffering. If so, then the class of facts is divisible into those facts that are value facts and those that are not, just as the class of judgments is divisible into value judgments and those that are not value judgments. Similarly, the terminology of \"is/ought\" is unfor\u00ad tunate if it suggests or is intended to suggest that all value judgments are \"ought\" rather than \"is\" judgments. In judging that undeserved suf\u00ad fering is intrinsically bad I am making an \"is\" judgment, not an \"ought\" judgment. I am judging that such suffering is bad, not that it ought to be bad. The truth of the value judgment that unmerited suf\u00ad fering is intrinsically bad might entail that we ought to endeavor not to inflict such suffering on anyone.",

    "question": "What is the significance of the distinction between \"is\" judgments and \"ought\" judgments in the context of value judgments?",
    "answer": "When making a value judgment, such as judging that undeserved suffering is intrinsically bad, you are making an \"is\" judgment, not an \"ought\" judgment. You are stating a fact about the nature of suffering, rather than stating what ought to be the case.",
