    "paragraph": " DeShawn is an expert when it comes to birdwatching, but John is a complete novice. At one point, they both see a fairly large bird with brownish feathers and a distinctive red tail. DeShawn immediately rec- ognizes because of these and other features that the bird is a Red-Tailed Hawk. John thinks it is a Red-Tailed Hawk too. Neither DeShawn nor John specifically call to mind particular beliefs or information about the distinctive features of this particular kind of bird. Rather, they both simply see the bird and form the belief that it is a Red-Tailed Hawk. It seems clear in this case that DeShawn\u2019s belief is justified, but John\u2019s isn\u2019t. Although it is immediately clear what a theory of justifica- tion should say in this case, it isn\u2019t immediately clear how a theory like phenomenal conservatism can yield the intuitively correct result. After all, DeShawn and John are seeing the same bird in the same conditions. Doesn\u2019t this mean that they are having the same appearance/seeming? And, if they both have the same seeming and it provides justification for one of them, shouldn\u2019t it provide justification for the other? RESPONSES There are a number of responses to this sort of case. One way that phenomenal conservatives may go is to distinguish between seemings and sensations (see A Pair of Hens pp. 148\u2013152) (Tucker 2010). The thought here is that while it is true that DeShawn and John have the same visual sensations, they don\u2019t actually have the same seemings. It seems to DeShawn that the bird is a Red-Tailed Hawk, but it doesn\u2019t seem so to John. This difference in their seemings explains why one is justified in his belief but the other isn\u2019t. Another response doesn\u2019t separate seemings from sensations, but instead insists that through training, an expert\u2019s appearances present different content to them than a novice\u2019s experiences do (Chudnoff 2021). The idea here is that because of his expert training, DeShawn\u2019s visual experiences offers him more information than John\u2019s does, and it is this additional richness of DeShawn\u2019s experiences that explain the difference in justification between them.",

    "question": "Why might one want to distinguish between seemings and sensations?",
    "answer": "One might want to distinguish between seemings and sensations in order to explain why DeShawn and John have different seemings despite having the same visual sensations. This distinction can help to account for the difference in justification between them.",
