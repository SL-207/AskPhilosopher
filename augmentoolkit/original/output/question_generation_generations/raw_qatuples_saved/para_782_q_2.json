    "paragraph": " People frequently, however, want a given state of affairs x to obtain because they believe that its obtaining would be good, yet rarely if ever want some state of affairs y to obtain because they believe that its obtaining would be bad. This is perhaps connected with the fact that the obtaining of a given state of affairs x would be good is a reason for wanting it to obtain, whereas the fact that the obtaining of some state of affairs y would be bad is not a reason for wanting it to obtain. Whereas it would not in the least be strange to say that I want x to obtain because I believe that its obtaining would be good, it would be strange to say that I want y to obtain because I believe that its obtaining would be bad. This perhaps in turn is connected with the fact that to want y to obtain because I believe it to be bad would be diabolical. Although it is at least abstractly possible for a person to be diabolical, people seem rarely if ever to actu\u00ad alize this possibility. Thus Paul, in wanting John to be bad because he hates John and not because he regards John's being bad as being itself bad, even though he does so regard it, is himself in that respect bad but not diabolical. Being bad is itself already bad enough without also being diabolical, which would be to be even worse. If what has been said above is correct, to love a person is to be dis\u00ad posed to want him to have various virtues in a degree sufficient to make him good, whereas to hate him is to be disposed to want him to have various vices in a degree sufficient to make him bad. In this way the Persons, Things, and Value 1 1 3 virtue of loving persons and the vice of hating persons are connected with other virtues and vices in such a way as to make such love one of the most central of the virtues and such hate one of the most central of the vices. From the fact, however, that to love a person is to be disposed to want him to be good and to hate him is to be disposed to want him to be bad it does not follow that a person who loves or hates another necessarily does in fact want the person loved or hated to be good or bad.",
