    "paragraph": " This state of affairs would consist of the occurrence of acts intended to prevent the existence of natural evils that in fact can exist and the occurrence of moral wrongs that in fact can occur. Whether the total value of the first state of affairs would be positive or negative would be determined by whether its positive intrinsic value would be greater than that of the second state of affairs. If it were greater its total value would be positive; if it were lesser its total value would be nega\u00ad tive. In the first case it would be intrinsically good that such a world exist; in the second it would be intrinsically bad that it exist. Since, however, natural evils do exist and moral wrongs do occur, such a world does not in fact exist and, indeed, is far removed from the actual world in which we live and move and have our being. If natural evils could exist but never in fact do and if moral wrongs could occur but never in fact do, acts intended to prevent their existence or occurrence could still occur. In such a world it might still be intrinsi\u00ad cally bad that natural evils could exist and that moral wrongs could occur, and it would be intrinsically good that acts intended to prevent 88 The Nature of Value their occurrence or existence occur. It would, however, be intrinsically good that in fact natural evils never exist and moral wrongs never occur. The obtaining of such a state of affairs would, however, be extrinsically bad in at least one respect, since it would be incompatible with the obtaining of another state of affairs, the obtaining of which would be intrinsically good. This state of affairs would consist of the occurrence of acts intended to eliminate or lessen evils that do in fact exist and to right wrongs that have in fact occurred. Whether the total value of the first state of affairs would be positive or negative would be determined, as before, by whether its positive intrinsic'value would be greater than that of the second state of affairs.",

    "question": "Can a world where natural evils cannot exist and moral wrongs cannot occur still be considered good in one respect?",
    "answer": "No, it would not be considered good in this respect because it would be incompatible with the obtaining of another state of affairs, the obtaining of which would be intrinsically good. This other state of affairs would consist of the occurrence of acts intended to eliminate or lessen evils that do in fact exist and to right wrongs that have in fact occurred.",
