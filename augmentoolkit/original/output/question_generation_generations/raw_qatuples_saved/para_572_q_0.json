    "paragraph": " That is known as the knowledge argument against physicalism. DISCUSSION Some respond by accepting the knowledge argument and exploring non-physicalist theories of consciousness. That is what Jackson did when first presenting the argument in his 1982 article, \u201cEpiphenom- enal Qualia.\u201d There he defended a non-physicalist theory called epi- phenomenalist property dualism. According to this theory, phenomenal properties\u2014properties of experience such as those Mary learns about Mary and the Black-and-White Room 33 after leaving the black-and-white room\u2014are non-physical properties that have physical causes but lack physical effects. Others develop dif- ferent non-physicalist theories, such as interactionist dualism, on which there are non-physical phenomenal properties that have both physical causes and physical effects (Chalmers 1996). But many reject the knowledge argument, for a variety of \u00adreasons. We\u2019ll mention four. First, some reject the set-up of the case by \u00adchallenging the claim that Mary learns all physical information while still in the black-and-white room. These philosophers grant that she learns all information that can be expressed in objective, scientific lan- guage. But they deny that all physical information can be so \u00adexpressed \u00ad(Horgan 1984, Howell 2013). Physical information, they argue, is \u00adinformation about physical things. And some information that cannot be expressed in objective, scientific language might nonetheless be information about physical things. In response, knowledge argument proponents contend that such non-objective (or subjective) informa- tion cannot be reconciled with a core physicalist doctrine: that all information is ultimately based on the information revealed by fun- damental physics (Chalmers 2010, Alter 2023). Second, some challenge the claim that Mary learns anything when she leaves the black-and-white room (Dennett 1991). Daniel C.",

    "question": "What is the knowledge argument against physicalism, and what is it trying to establish?",
    "answer": "The knowledge argument against physicalism is a philosophical challenge that asserts that there are certain properties of experience, such as those related to color, that cannot be known through physical means. This argument is trying to establish that it is impossible to reduce conscious experience to purely physical phenomena.",
