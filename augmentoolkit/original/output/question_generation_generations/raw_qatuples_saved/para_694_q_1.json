    "paragraph": " The present work is in that tradition. It seeks to develop and vindicate a view of the irreducibility, rationality, and objectivity of value as an alternative to reductionist, skeptical, rel\u00ad ativist, and subjectivist treatments of value. This it does in what may be referred to as a \"positive\" as opposed to a \"negative\" way by concen\u00ad trating mainly on the development of my own views rather_than on pre\u00ad senting detailed criticisms of the views of others, and there are few explicit references to and discussions of recent work. It will be an easy matter for those familiar with the recent literature to discover from the exposition of my own views the respects in which I agree and those in which I disagree with the views of recent writers on the topics I treat. For recent incisive criticisms, with which in the main I agree and to which I have little to add, of recent reductionist, skeptical, relativist, and subjectivist approaches to value theory I refer the reader to the crit\u00ad icisms presented by Professor Panayot Butchvarov in his excellent book Skepticism in Ethics. It might be helpful if I present here a brief account of the course of the IX x Preface book. One of the central theses of the book is that value is neither iden\u00ad tical with nor reducible to psychological phenomena such as liking or disliking, preferring, evaluating, and valuing or disvaluing, whether taken singly or in various combinations. In the first chapter, which is mainly phenomenological in character, I consider some of the differ\u00ad ences between value and various of these psychological phenomena, some of the differences between such phenomena and some of the rel a - tions in which they stand to one another, and different levels of such phenomena. In chapter 2, which is mainly ontological in nature, I discuss the on\u00ad tological categories to which the bearers of intrinsic value belong. To use the language of Meinong, such categories are species of either of two genera-objects and objectives.",
