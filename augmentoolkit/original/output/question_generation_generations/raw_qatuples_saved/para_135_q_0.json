    "paragraph": " 167). So, although Tye believes that \u201cour visual fields do not have gaps in them\u201d (because we unconsciously perceive things we don\u2019t notice), he maintains that conscious perception is sparse. Others deny that claim, holding instead that conscious perception is rich\u2014roughly as rich as is common to assume. When you first see drawing A, you do see the glasses, and Sarah does see Sam\u2014consciously, in both cases. You just don\u2019t notice that you do. On this view, consciousness requires neither attention nor access (at least not in the ways Tye and others think). One proponent of that alternative view is Fred Dretske (2007). Ac- cording to Dretske, Sarah sees Sam because she can know things about him by the way he looks. For example, she knows that no one gath- ered around the table was wearing a clown suit. If Sam had not been dressed normally (say, normally for a dinner party rather than a circus), then Sarah might not have been able to know that. Sarah saw Sam. She just didn\u2019t notice that she did. Dretske fleshes out that idea using a different example. Suppose you\u2019re shown an image of gray brick walls, with bricks missing in various, random places. Then you\u2019re shown an image that\u2019s the same except that there\u2019s one extra brick, in the middle somewhere, which Dretske names \u201cSam\u201d (the same name he gives to the person that Sarah didn\u2019t notice in his other example). You don\u2019t see the difference. But had Sam been black instead of gray or tilted instead of straight, you would have seen the difference pretty much immediately. According to Dretske, you know some things about Sam: you know that Sam isn\u2019t black or tilted. Moreover, you know those things on the basis of how Sam looks. So, you see Sam. You just didn\u2019t notice that you did. PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 228 Dretske\u2019s argument can be resisted. For one thing, one could grant everything Dretske says but deny that you consciously see Sam.",
