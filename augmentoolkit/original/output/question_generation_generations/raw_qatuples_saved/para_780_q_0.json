    "paragraph": " 32 PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 196 THE CASE First, think of a triangle. Try to bring it before your mind. Spend a moment reflecting on your mental act and what it is like. Next, think of a chiliagon. Try to bring it before your mind. Again, spend a \u00admoment reflecting on your mental act and what it is like. In Descartes\u2019 view, these two mental activities proceed differently. In the first case, when he thinks of a triangle and tries to bring it before his mind, he is able to \u201csee\u201d the triangle, all three sides of the bounded fig- ure, in what he calls his mind\u2019s eye. He takes his activity to be similar ex- perientially to perceiving, and it\u2019s this kind of activity that he takes to be imagining. In the second case, however, when he thinks of a chiliagon and tries to bring it before his mind, Descartes reports that he doesn\u2019t do quite the same thing. Just as he understands that a triangle has three sides, he understands that a chiliagon has 1000 sides. But he reports that he is unable to see all 1000 sides of the chiliagon before his mind\u2019s eye. Yes, he might produce some kind of \u201cconfused representation of some figure,\u201d but that figure is not necessarily a chiliagon, and there\u2019s nothing to distinguish it from the kind of representation that he would produce were he to try to bring a myriagon before his mind. In his view, his con- sideration of the chiliagon does not proceed by way of imagination, but rather by way of pure understanding. As contemporary philosophers would say, he imagines the triangle but conceives of the chiliagon. What\u2019s the difference? Descartes explains it by reflecting on what we might do when calling a pentagon to mind. As he notes, he can under- stand what a pentagon is, just as he can understand what a chiliagon or a myriagon is\u2014understanding that proceeds without the employment of imagination. But, he adds, he can do something else with the pen- tagon.",

    "question": "What is the difference between imagining a triangle and a chiliagon in Descartes' view?",
    "answer": "In Descartes' view, when imagining a triangle, one can see the whole shape, including its three sides, in one's mind's eye. However, when trying to imagine a chiliagon, one cannot see all 1000 sides of the shape, and instead only has a confused representation of a figure that may or may not be a chiliagon.",
