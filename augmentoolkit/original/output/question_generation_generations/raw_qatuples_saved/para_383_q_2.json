    "paragraph": " Chapter 9 Attitudes toward the Indifferent In this chapter we turn to treat a topic that has not received the atten\u00ad tion it merits. This is the topic of the value of different attitudes that might be taken toward things that are neither intrinsically good nor intrinsically bad but rather intrinsically indifferent. If, as subjectivists in value theory hold, nothing is either intrinsically good or intrinsically bad, then everything is indifferent, including all likings, dislikings, and indifferences, so that no liking or disliking of or being indifferent toward something, regardless of what it might be, would be either good or bad but instead would be indifferent. On the other hand, the view prevalent among late medieval scholastics to the effect that the concept of good, like that of being, is a transcendental concept and thus is applicable to everything that has being, would seem to imply that there are no indifferent things. If there were none, the question of which atti\u00ad tudes that might be taken toward the indifferent are appropriate would not arise or at least would have little or no importance for practice. Some things, however, do seem to be intrinsically good, others intrinsi\u00ad cally bad, and others intrinsically indifferent. To avoid such repeated uses of \"intrinsically,\" in the remainder of this chapter the terms \"good,\" \"bad,\" and \"indifferent,\" unless otherwise indicated, will be used to indicate intrinsic rather than extrinsic goodness, badness, and indifference. 1. Likings and Dislikings of Good and Bad Objects We begin with a brief review of some points that are at least implicit in what was said earlier. A first-order liking is good if its object is good, bad if its object is bad. A first-order disliking, on the other hand, is good 1 72 Attitudes toward the Indifferent 1 73 if its object is bad, bad if its object is good. Precisely similar considera\u00ad tions apply to second-order likings and dislikings.",
