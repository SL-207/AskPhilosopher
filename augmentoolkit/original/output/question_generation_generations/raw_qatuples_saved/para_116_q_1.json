    "paragraph": " Since qualia seem essential to making a mental state the state that it is, this possibility poses a serious threat to functionalism. The Blockhead thought experiment aims to show that a system could be in the very same functional state as a human being who is experiencing a qualitative state even though the system lacks qualia altogether. THE CASE Imagine a giant robot called the Blockhead. It has a body that, outwardly, looks very much like a human body. On the inside, however, it is very different. In its head is a hollow cavity containing a bank of lights, an array of buttons, a bulletin board covered with a very large number of note cards, and a correspondingly large number of miniature individ- uals. The Blockhead\u2019s sensory organs are all connected to the bank of lights, with different sensory inputs causing different lights to blink on or off. The buttons are connected to the Blockhead\u2019s motor system, with different buttons causing different motor activities to occur. The note cards on the bulletin board each indicate the current state of the system. All of this works to mirror the complex computer program in which your mentality consists. In you, this program is implemented by biological neurons; in the Blockhead, it is implemented by the \u00admini-individuals, each of whom plays the role of a single neuron. More specifically, each mini-individual is assigned a very simple task. Take one particular mini-individual that we\u2019ll call \u201cG-72.\u201d All that G-72 has to do is wait for the note card to display G and for input light I-53 to come on. When that happens, G-72 presses output button O-97 and changes the card on the bulletin board to M. G-73 has a similar task: When the note card displays G and input light I-54 comes on, press output button O-98 and change the card to N. And so on for all the other mini-\u00ad individuals. The mini-individuals are very good at their operations, and, as a result, the overall system is functionally equivalent to you.",

    "answer": "The Blockhead's sensory system is connected to a bank of lights, with different sensory inputs causing different lights to blink on or off. The lights correspond to different sensory inputs, such as visual or auditory inputs.",
