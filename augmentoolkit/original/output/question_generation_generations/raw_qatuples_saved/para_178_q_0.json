    "paragraph": " Had we no concern for the values of theo\u00ad retical reason it would be hard to understand why we regard him as such a pathetic figure, regardless of how contented and happy he in his conceited ignorance might be. There is perhaps no harm in regarding the advocacy of the primacy of practical over theoretical reason as a form of pragmatism, provided that it is recognized that such a form of pragmatism would be a very attenuated form indeed. Although such a form of pragmatism would have certain affinities with the position advocated by William James in \"The Will to Believe,\" it would have few if any with the views advanced in his book Pragmatism. As is evident from what was said above, such a form of pragmatism in no way requires an acceptance of a pragmatic theory of truth and in fact is incompatible with such a theory. Although deception, whether of others or of oneself, might work in the sense that it makes possible the attainment of certain non-theoretical values the realization of which would otherwise be impossible, and the attainment of which has greater value than the realization of the sacrificed theoret\u00ad ical values would have, it by no means follows that the propositions the deceived are deceived into accepting are true. Deception might work, in the sense of contributing to the realization of certain non-theoretical values, regardless of whether the proposition the deceived person accepts is true or false. It is true if the state of affairs believed to obtain in accepting the proposition does in fact obtain, false if it does not in fact obtain. Such a view of truth is not pragmatic. Indeed, one can even conceive of circumstances in which even the The Primacy of Practical Rationality 145 acceptance of contradictory propositions might work, in the sense of contributing to the realization of certain non-theoretical values that otherwise would not be realizable. Although, as was indicated above, one cannot believe both of two contradictory propositions if one recog\u00ad nizes that they are contradictories, since to recognize that they are con\u00ad tradictories is to see that if one is true the other is false, one can accept both of two propositions, p and q, even though p entails that r is true and q that r is false, provided that one does not recognize that p entails the truth of r and q the falsity of r.",
