    "paragraph": " Even our knowledge of such entailments, however, rests on our knowing something without proof, since the proposition that q entails p either is sufficiently evident in itself to justify our accepting it without proof or it is not. If it is not, then we can know that it is true only if we know that some other proposition, s, is true and that s entails that q entails p. The same considerations, however, would apply to s and to the proposition that s entails that q entails p. If, then, anything at all is 70 The Nature of Value evident, it is evident both that proof cannot go on forever and that if anything at all is to be known then something must be known without proof. Although it is sometimes, but fortunately not always, difficult in the extreme to know with certainty that one has reached a point at which no further proof is possible, one finally does reach a point at which one accepts a given proposition without proof simply because it is seen to be true or because, after the most careful reflection of which one is capable, it seems to be true. Proof of the truth of a given proposition is necessary if we are to know it to be true only if we do not already know it to be true without proof through seeing it to be true. Moreover, ultimately we can know that a given proof establishes the truth of a given proposition only if we see without proof that each step in the proof follows from the preceding step. This means that ultimately the process of proving the truth of a given proposition consists in or depends upon a series of insights or see\u00ad ings. This holds regardless of whether the proof is designed to establish that the proposition to be proved is true necessarily or true only with some degree of probability. To know that the premises of a given argu\u00ad ment establish that the conclusion is true necessarily we must see that their truth entails its truth, and to know that they establish that the con\u00ad clusion is true with a certain degree of probability we must see that their truth establishes that the conclusion is true with that degree of proba\u00ad bility.",

    "question": "What is the difference between knowing that a proposition is necessarily true and knowing that it is true with a certain degree of probability?",
    "answer": "To know that a proposition is necessarily true, you must see that its truth entails the truth of the proposition. To know that a proposition is true with a certain degree of probability, you must see that its truth establishes that the proposition is true with that degree of probability.",
