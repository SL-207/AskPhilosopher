To punish a person is to inflict suffering on him, or at least to endeavor to do so. Such suffering, taken in abstraction from its being deserved, is bad. If, 2 1 1 212 Notes to Chapters 3-5 however, it is deserved it is good that it be inflicted, since it is good that a person receive what he deserves. This is not to deny that it is bad that more suffering be inflicted on a person than he deserves. Thus a state of affairs consisting of ( 1 ) a person's doing something that deserves punishment and (2) his suffering more punishment than he deserves, rather than being good, is instead bad. For a more extended treatment of retributive punishment, see my \"A Defense of Retribu- tivism\" and my Rights, Goods, and Democracy, chapter 4. 4.
