    "paragraph": " If the preceding is correct, the question of whether the obtaining of a given state of affairs would be good or bad is independent of the ques\u00ad tion of whether anyone who wants it to obtain regards its obtaining as good or bad. This is consistent with my earlier contention that the goodness or badness of the obtaining of a given state of affairs is deter\u00ad mined by the nature of the state of affairs in question, taken in abstrac\u00ad tion from any consideration of the question of whether it does or does not obtain. If the nature of a given state of affairs is such that its obtaining would be good (or bad), then anyone who wants that state of affairs to obtain thereby wants something that would be a good (or a bad) state of affairs to obtain even though he might not regard its obtaining as being good (or bad). Thus Paul, who wants John to be bad, 1 12 The Nature of Value thereby wants something that would be a bad state of affairs to obtain even though he might not regard its obtaining as being bad; and Peter, who wants John to be good, thereby wants something that would be a good state of affairs to obtain even though he might not regard its obtaining as being good. Suppose, however, that Paul does believe that John's being bad would be bad. Could he then still want John to be bad or be pleased that he is? The answer, I believe, is that he could. He might hate John so pro\u00ad foundly that he wants him to be bad and is pleased that he is even though he regards his being bad as being itself bad. From the fact that a person regards the obtaining of a given state of affairs as good ( or bad) it does not follow that he wants (or does not want) it to obtain. It is pos\u00ad sible ( 1) to regard the obtaining of a given state of affairs x as good without wanting it to obtain and (2) to regard the obtaining of some state of affairs y as bad without wanting it not to obtain. This is consis\u00ad tent with my earlier contention that a person can like (or dislike) some\u00ad thing even while also regarding it as bad ( or good).",
