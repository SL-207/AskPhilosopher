    "paragraph": " Sometimes people speak of internalist and externalist views of knowledge, but this is misleading. All views of knowledge are external, in the sense that they hold that at least some of the requirements for knowledge exist outside of the knower\u2019s mental life. For instance, all parties to the internalism/externalism debate can agree that truth is a requirement for knowledge that doesn\u2019t simply depend upon the mind of the knower. Truth is external because what is true and what is false is determined by how the universe is, not by what we think about how the universe is. JUSTIFICATION 118 The internalism/externalism debate is about justification, not knowledge. However, we need to draw a further distinction here be- cause as we saw in the background to Saul the Superstitious Lawyer (pp. 42\u201347) there are at least two important senses of \u201cjustification\u201d. One concerns what one has justification for believing and the other concerns what one justifiedly believes. The former sort of justification is often called \u201cpropositional justification\u201d because it is the justifica- tion one has in support of the truth of a particular proposition. Recall that one can have justification for believing something even if one doesn\u2019t actually believe it. The other sort of justification, when one justifiedly believes something, is often called \u201cdoxastic justification\u201d because it concerns whether one\u2019s actual belief (a kind of doxastic attitude) is justified. The distinction between propositional justifica- tion and doxastic justification is important to keep in mind because most internalists think that something beyond what is internal to a subject\u2019s mental life is required for a belief to be based on one\u2019s reasons such as the belief being appropriately caused by one\u2019s reasons. As a result, even most internalists accept that doxastic justification is partly an external matter. Hence, really when we talk about internalists in epistemology, we are talking about people who maintain that propo- sitional justification is internal.",
