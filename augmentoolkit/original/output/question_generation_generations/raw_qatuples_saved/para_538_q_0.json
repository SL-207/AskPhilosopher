    "paragraph": " Maybe we have enough evidence to conclude that physicalism is true\u2014and that consciousness is a physical process of some kind. But, even if we do, we don\u2019t understand how physicalism could be true. At present, our theoretical understanding of the mental\u2013physical relationship is so impoverished that understanding how physicalism could be true is beyond our ken. With respect to physicalism, we are in roughly the position that Thales is in with respect to the theory that matter is energy. We might believe, or even know, that it is true; we just don\u2019t have any sense of how it could be true. But that might change. Nagel thinks we might one day be able to understand how physicalism could be true. He speculates that we might develop new theoretical concepts connecting the mental and the physical, thereby showing how an objective physical theory could reveal the true nature of conscious experiences. Some are less opti- mistic than Nagel is. They argue that it will always seem mysterious to us how a conscious experience could literally be a brain event or any other physical phenomenon (McGinn 1989). Our concept-forming capacities are simply not capable of forming the concepts needed for understanding how physicalism could be true. That more pessimistic conclusion is consistent with physicalism\u2019s truth, just as Nagel\u2019s more optimistic conclusion is. But some philosophers go further. They take our puzzlement to reflect an insight about the nature of consciousness: consciousness can\u2019t be explained physically\u2014not because of some- thing we don\u2019t understand, but \u00adbecause consciousness is not a physical phenomenon. These philosophers therefore develop non-physicalist theories, such as property dualism (Chalmers 1996). Other philosophers try to defuse the threat to physicalism. Some invoke strategies similar to those used to defend physicalism from the What It\u2019s Like to Be a Bat 29 knowledge argument (see Chapter 6).",
