    "paragraph": " There is, or at least seems to be, a mutual entailment (a) between the proposition that a given moral agent, a, has a moral right to something, x, and propositions (1) and (2) above and (b) between the proposition that a being, a, who is not a moral agent has a moral right to some\u00ad thing, x, and proposition (2) above. Propositions ( 1 ) and (2), however, are true in the case of any given moral agent, a, and proposition (2) in the case of any being, a, who is not a moral agent, only because a has a moral right to x; whereas a does not have a moral right to x because, given that a is a moral agent, propositions ( 1) and (2) are true or be\u00ad cause, given that a is not a moral agent, proposition (2) is true. This can perhaps be seen more clearly in cases in which the prima facie duty of a moral agent, b, to act compatibly with a's acquiring or retaining x is 78 The Nature of Value not overridden by some conflicting weightier prima f acie duty or coun\u00ad tered by some conflicting prima facie duty of equal weight, so that b has an absolute duty to act compatibly with a's acquiring or retaining x and thus acts wrongly in not doing so and perhaps also wrongs a. If b wrongs a it is because a has some right that b violates; a, however, does not have the right in question because b violates it and thereby wrongs a. The violation of a right presupposes the existence of the right violated, but a right can exist without being violated. Thus although the concept of a moral right can, I think, be explicated in the ways in\u00ad dicated, it cannot be dispensed with by substituting for it the concepts in terms of which it is explicated, as I earlier thought. 5 An attempt has been made to explicate the moral concepts discussed above, which are among the central concepts of moral philosophy, without doing so in terms of the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness. Indeed, with the possible exception of the concept of supererogation, each of these concepts has been explicated without the introduction of any concept of goodness or badness at all, whether in\u00ad trinsic or extrinsic.",

    "question": "Can the concept of a moral right be dispensed with by substituting other concepts, such as those related to intrinsic goodness and badness?",
    "answer": "No, the concept of a moral right cannot be dispensed with by substituting other concepts. It has been attempted to explicate moral concepts without introducing concepts of goodness or badness, but the concept of a moral right still seems necessary.",
