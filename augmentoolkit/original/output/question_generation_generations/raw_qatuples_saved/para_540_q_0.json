    "paragraph": " Though they are, we might say, omniscient about the objective facts about the world, they can still fail to know which god they are. Until they learn \u201cI am the god on the PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 292 tallest mountain\u201d or \u201cI am the God on the coldest mountain,\u201d they will lack important knowledge about the world (Lewis 1979). Both Lingens in the Library and The Two Gods contain a \u00adsimilar moral: indexical knowledge\u2014which includes I-beliefs, but also here-beliefs and now-beliefs\u2014cannot be derived from non-\u00adindexical knowledge. Indexical knowledge is, in a sense, situated knowledge in that it cannot be attained from a completely objective, detached \u00adperspective. Indexical belief also seems to have further interesting properties. First, it seems particularly connected with action. I can know the man with the axe is about to leap out at the boy in the gar- den maze, but that won\u2019t lead to action\u2014or fear, or planning to act\u2014 unless I know I am the boy in the garden maze (or that the man with the axe is in front of me!) Second, indexical belief can involve a higher degree of certainty than other contingent truths. This is most obvious in Descartes\u2019 cogito. I am certain that I am thinking. I cannot be certain that the author of this chapter is thinking\u2014even if I am the author of this chapter. I could be fooled that I have authored this chapter. All of these are puzzling characteristics that seem to demand an explanation in terms of the nature of indexical concepts and thoughts. DISCUSSION In his classic essay \u201cThe Thought: A Logical Inquiry,\u201d Gottlob Frege kicks off the discussion by claiming that \u201ceveryone is presented to him- self in a particular and primitive way, in which he is presented to no-one else\u201d (1956, p. 298). This can suggest several different possibilities. One is that each person has a self-concept at the heart of their I-thoughts\u2014a concept that is completely unique to them.",

    "question": "What is the nature of indexical knowledge, and why does it seem to be situated knowledge?",
    "answer": "Indexical knowledge is knowledge that is tied to a particular perspective or location, and it cannot be derived from completely objective, detached knowledge. It is situated knowledge in that it requires a specific context or perspective to be understood.",
