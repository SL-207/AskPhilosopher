    "paragraph": " Imagine you have just read and learned for the first time that the Chicago Bears won Super Bowl XX by reading a highly reliable epistemology book (this very book, in fact). Since you trust what you read in this highly relia- ble epistemology book, you believe and even know that the Chicago Bears won Super Bowl XX. Now let\u2019s imagine that tomorrow you come across another highly reliable book that says that some other team won Super Bowl XX. What should you do? Given that you should disregard evidence that goes against what you know because it is misleading, it seems that you shouldn\u2019t pay any attention to what this new book says. Imagine that after reading this other book you decide to google \u201cSuper Bowl XX\u201d and the first five hits that come up all say that the Chicago Bears didn\u2019t win Super Bowl XX. What should you do now? Well, since you know that the Chicago Bears The Dogmatism Puzzle 219 did win the Super Bowl, it seems that again you shouldn\u2019t pay any attention to this evidence either. The story is the same, no matter how much additional evidence you come across saying that the \u00adChicago Bears didn\u2019t win Super Bowl XX. But it seems crazy to think that you should ignore all of this evidence! Imagine that someone else were to tell you that they learned about the Chicago Bears winning Super Bowl XX in the way that you did and that they are now simply ig- noring any evidence that they encounter that goes against this claim. Wouldn\u2019t you think that they are being unreasonably dogmatic? On the one hand, it seems that we should disregard evidence that we know to be misleading, and we know that evidence that goes against the things we know to be true is misleading evidence. On the other hand, it seems that ignoring evidence in this way amounts to being unreasonably dogmatic. That\u2019s the dogmatism puzzle. The chal- lenge is to figure out where the seemingly correct reasoning that led us to being dogmatic went wrong.",
