    "paragraph": " They claim it is conceivable that there be a mosaic that is the same in all non-circular respects as the actual mo- saic and yet lack circular tiles entirely. They infer that such a mosaic is possible, and conclude again that the circles tiles are basic. The slug versions of the knowledge and conceivability \u00adarguments are unsound. Their conclusions are false. According to Stoljar, the \u00adreason they seem convincing to some slug philosophers is that those philos- ophers don\u2019t know some basic facts about the mosaic on which they live. Their ignorance derives from the limitation in their \u00adperceptual system that prevents them from being able to \u00adperceive \u00adpie-shaped tiles. Perhaps they\u2019ll eventually overcome that limitation. Or \u00adperhaps they won\u2019t. In any case, the story is suggestive. Some \u00adhuman \u00adphilosophers find the knowledge and conceivability \u00adarguments convincing. But per- haps those arguments are unsound too, just like the slug versions are. Maybe they seem convincing only because we humans are \u00adignorant of some basic (or non-basic) physical facts\u2014physical facts that, together with known physical facts, undermine a premise of the knowledge The Slugs and the Tiles 63 and conceivability arguments. For example, maybe there are unknown physical facts that would, if known, reveal why any world that\u2019s phys- ically and functionally indistinguishable from the actual world must contain consciousness\u2014and thus why zombie worlds are inconceiv- able. Perhaps we\u2019ll eventually learn those physical facts, or perhaps we won\u2019t. In any case, how can proponents of the knowledge and \u00adconceivability arguments be confident that they\u2019re not making the same sort of error that their slug counterparts are making? DISCUSSION Stoljar\u2019s slug-and-tiles case is a variation of a similar thought experi- ment that Frank Jackson devised for a different purpose. Jackson im- agined intelligent sea slugs that \u201chave only a very restricted conception of the world by comparison with ours, the explanation for this being the nature of their immediate environment\u201d (1982, pp.",

    "question": "What is one possible reason why the proponents of the knowledge and conceivability arguments are not confident that they are making the same type of error as the slug philosophers?",
    "answer": "They may not be confident because, unlike the slug philosophers, the proponents of the knowledge and conceivability arguments are not aware of any limitations in their perceptual system that prevent them from perceiving certain facts.",
