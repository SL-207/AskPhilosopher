    "paragraph": " A second class consists of those indifferent things it is good for anyone to be indifferent toward and bad for anyone to like or dislike. Anyone's being indifferent toward any member of this class is good, and anyone's liking or disliking any member of it is bad. A third class, if a third is recognized, would consist of those indifferent things it would be good for anyone to dislike and bad for anyone to like or to be indifferent toward. Anyone's disliking any member of this class would be good, and anyone's liking or being indifferent toward any member of it would be bad. Let us call the first class a, the second b, the third c. There seems to be little, if anything, to recommend this version. If the members of class a are such that anyone's liking any of them would be good and anyone's disliking or being indifferent toward any of them would be bad, then it would seem that there must be some property pos\u00ad sess\u045cd by each member of class a by virtue of the possession of which it is good to like it and bad to dislike or to be indifferent toward it. Similar considerations, with of course the obvious necessary changes, would apply to the members of class b, the members of which are such that it Attitudes toward the Indifferent 1 83 would be good that anyone be indifferent toward them, and to the members of class c, if such a class is recognized, the members of which are such that it would be good that anyone dislike them. If, however, these considerations are acceptable, then it is hard to see how all three classes can be classes of indifferent things. If, that is, there is something about the members of class a that makes it good for anyone to like any of them and bad to dislike or to be indifferent toward any, and if there is something about the members of class c that makes it good for anyone to dislike any of them and bad to like or to be indifferent toward any, then the members of class a would seem to be good rather than indif\u00ad ferent and those of class c bad rather than indifferent.",
