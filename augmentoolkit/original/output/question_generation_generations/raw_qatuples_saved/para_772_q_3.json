    "paragraph": " There is a difference between which properties each of the two wants John to have only because Paul hates and Peter loves John. It Persons, Things, and Value 1 1 1 is also because Paul hates and Peter loves John that Paul would be pleased if he believed that John has certain bad-making properties and that Peter would be pleased if he believed that John has certain good\u00ad making properties. The nature of the state of affairs consisting of John's being bad is such that its obtaining would be bad, and the nature of that consisting of his being good is such that its obtaining would be good. For the sake of economy of expression, let us say that Paul, in wanting John to be bad, wants a bad state of affairs to obtain and that Peter, in wanting John to be good, wants a good state of affairs to obtain. Such a way of speaking, although more economical, is elliptical because, as was argued earlier, to say that a state of affairs is good ( or bad) is to say that its obtaining would be good (or bad). To say, however;that Paul wants a bad state of affairs, x, to obtain or that Peter wants a good state of affairs, y, to obtain is not to say that Paul regards the obtaining of x as bad or that Peter regards the obtaining of y as good. Paul might want x to obtain, and Peter y to obtain, while regarding the obtaining of x or of y as being neither good nor pad or without considering the question of whether the obtaining of either would be either good or bad. Simi\u00ad larly, Paul might believe and be pleased that x obtains, and Peter that y obtains, without regarding the obtaining of either as good or bad or without considering the question of whether the obtaining of either would be good or bad. Wanting a given state of affairs to obtain or being pleased that it obtains is neither identical with nor entails regarding its obtaining as being good. Conversely, regarding the obtaining of a given state of affairs as good is neither identical with nor entails either wanting it to obtain or being pleased that it obtains.",

    "question": "Does regarding the obtaining of a state of affairs as good necessarily mean that you want it to obtain or are pleased that it obtains?",
    "answer": "No, it does not. Regardng the obtaining of a state of affairs as good is neither identical with nor entails either wanting it to obtain or being pleased that it obtains. It is possible to regard the obtaining of a state of affairs as good without wanting or being pleased that it obtains.",
