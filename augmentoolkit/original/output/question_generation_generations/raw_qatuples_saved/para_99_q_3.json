    "paragraph": " In response, however, the representa- tionalist might try to find differences between the representational contents of the two experiences (see, e.g., Alter 2006). Finally, synesthesia might be seen to raise worries about the re- liability of introspection. Generally speaking, we are deferential to PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 222 individuals when they are reporting their experiences. Even if intro- spective reports are not infallible, we tend to think that people them- selves are the best judges of what kinds of experiences they are having. With respect to synesthesia, however, some philosophers and other researchers have worried about the accuracy or completeness of in- dividuals\u2019 introspective reports. Take synesthetes with grapheme-color synesthesia and, in particular, someone like Jade, for whom the num- ber 2 appears red. When looking at a page with the number 2 printed on it, the synesthete can accurately report what color ink was used (black, say). So, the number must also appear black to them. As Fiona Macpherson argues, it is hard to make sense of how this could be\u2014 that is, how the number could appear both (wholly) red and (wholly) black to someone like Jade. Could there really be experiences that represent two colors to be (wholly) in the same place at the same time? Could the red experience really be just like the red experience Jade has when looking at an apple? On Macpherson\u2019s view, more work is needed to untangle and understand the introspective reports of synesthetes and the phenomenal nature of synesthetic experience.

    "question": "Can synesthetes accurately report what they are experiencing based on their introspection?",
    "answer": "Yes, synesthetes can accurately report what they are experiencing based on their introspection. For example, Jade can accurately report that the number 2 appears red when looking at a page with the number 2 printed on it. However, the accuracy or completeness of their introspective reports may be questioned by some researchers.",
