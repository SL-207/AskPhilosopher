    "paragraph": " From this, however, it does not follow that liking good and disliking bad objects either more or less than they merit are not good. Instead, all that follows is that such likings and dislikings are not as good as those that are proportioned precisely to the goodness or badness of their objects. This is only an instance of the principle, if it may be called such, that from the fact that something, a, is better than something else, b, it does not follow that b is not good. Something, b, can still be good even though it is not as good as, and is therefore worse than, something else, a. Similarly, from the fact that something, a, is better than something else, b, it does not follow that a is good. Instead, a and b might both be bad, with a not being as bad as b. If a is better than b, it is good to like a more than b, or to dislike a less than b, regardless of whether a and b are both good, both bad, or a good and b bad. Given that a is better than b and that a and b are both good, liking each is still good even though liking b more than a is bad. Given, however, that a is better than b and that a and b are both bad, liking either is still bad even though liking a more than b, or disliking a less than b, is good. But if a is good and b bad, liking a and disliking b is good, disliking a and liking b bad, regardless of whether they are liked or disliked to the precise degree to which they merit being liked or disliked. Attitudes toward the Indifferent 1 75 It is possible, however, that a good object be liked far more than it merits being liked and that a bad object be disliked far more than it merits being disliked. Although such excessive liking and disliking would be bad, the liking of the good object, taken simply as a liking of a good object completely in abstraction from the fact that it is an exces\u00ad sive liking, would be good, as would the disliking of the bad object, taken simply as a disliking of a bad object completely in abstraction from the fact that it is an excessive disliking.",
