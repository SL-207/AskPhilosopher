    "paragraph": " Walt has recently been diagnosed with an illness that he knows has an extremely low survival rate. In light of his knowledge of the low survival rate, Walt has a good reason that can make it epistemically justified for him to believe that he is unlikely to recover. Nevertheless, it may be that if Walt were to believe that he will recover, he would be able to better manage his suffering and be happier. In such a case, believing that he will recover is not epistemi- cally justified for Walt. Nevertheless, this belief might be pragmatically justified. Good pragmatic reasons for belief do not need to be indic- ative of the truth; instead, they are simply reasons that make believing beneficial for the person. Hence, in this case Walt has pragmatic jus- tification for believing that he will recover (believing is beneficial to him), but unfortunately, he lacks epistemic justification for believing that he will recover. Throughout our discussions, we are concerned with epistemic justification, the sort of justification that is connected to truth and is necessary for knowledge. Another distinction that we will explore here is that between hav- ing justification for a belief and justifying a belief. The former, having justification, is a state of a person. Either a person has justification for believing something or they don\u2019t. Justifying a belief isn\u2019t a state of a person, but rather it is an action. Justifying a belief involves explaining to someone (possibly one\u2019s own self) the evidence or reasons that one has in support of a particular proposition. Although having justification and justifying a belief are very differ- ent, it isn\u2019t hard to see why they are sometimes confused. If one fails in the attempt to justify a belief to someone, that may mean that one didn\u2019t have justification to begin with and still lacks it. That is to say, sometimes attempting to justify a belief leads to the realization that one doesn\u2019t have good reason to believe.",

    "question": "Can attempting to justify a belief lead to the realization that one doesn't have good reason to believe something?",
    "answer": "Yes, attempting to justify a belief can lead to the realization that one doesn't have good reason to believe something. This is because if a person fails to justify a belief to someone else, it may mean that they didn't have justification to begin with, and still lack it.",
