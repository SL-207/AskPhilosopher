    "paragraph": " Such an inward feeling of compassion would be an inward manifestation of the virtue of compassion, and anyone who feels compassion for others even though he can say or do nothing to help has at least to some slight degree the virtue of compassion. Such a person, however, would have this virtue only to a slight degree indeed if he is never moved by his com\u00ad passion to render such aid as he can to those who need it. 5. Virtues and Vices Although various of the virtues can be and sometimes are manifested inwardly without also being manifested outwardly, various of the vices or bad-making properties of a person are frequently more likely than the virtues to be manifested only inwardly. Thus I, upon hearing someone I regard as a rival being praised, might be displeased and 104 The Nature of Value envious of him even though such displeasure and envy remain entirely inward and receive no outward manifestation whatever. If so, then I am afflicted with the sin or vice of envy even though it has no outward manifestation at all. The fact that vice is frequently more likely than virtue to be manifested only inwardly is connected with the fact that people generally regard the virtues as good-making and the vices as bad-making properties of a person. They usually would not express the thought expressed by this language by using the latter but instead would probably express it, if they express it at all, by saying something to the effect that virtues and virtuous peop.le are good, vices and vicious people bad. Regardless, however, of what language is used to express the thought, we generally tend to regard the virtues as good-making and the vices as bad-making properties of a person. We tend, that is, to think that people are good to the degree that they possess various of the virtues, bad to the degree that they are afflicted with various of the vices. We tend also to think that the respects in which a person is good are functions of the virtues he has and that the respects in which a person is bad are functions of the vices he has.",
