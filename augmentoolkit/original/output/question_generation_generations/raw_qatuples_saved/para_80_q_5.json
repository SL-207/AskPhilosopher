    "paragraph": " (C-fiber stimulation is no longer considered an empirically plausible candidate for the relevant brain process; but here it will serve as a placeholder for one that is.) According to func- tionalism, mental states are explained in functional terms\u2014that is, in terms of (i) environmental stimuli, (ii) behavioral responses, and (iii) relations among mental states. For example, very roughly, pain is that mental state that typically: (i) is caused by damage to the body; (ii) causes wincing and saying things like \u201couch\u201d; and (iii) combines with the desire to avoid the state and the belief that aspirin will help do that to cause one to take aspirin. In short, pain is explained in terms of its characteristic causal role. David K. Lewis raises a challenge for these theories, based on the possibility of what he calls mad pain and Martian pain. 15 PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 88 THE CASES Mad pain is pain that doesn\u2019t play pain\u2019s characteristic causal role. For example, imagine Maddy. She feels pain not when her body is cut, burned, etc., but instead when she does moderate exercise or has an empty stomach. And, though to us pain is distracting, to her it is not. Instead, her pain makes her think about mathematics. Unlike mad pain, Martian pain plays pain\u2019s characteristic causal role. But Martian pain differs from our pain in its physical realization. For example, imagine Marty. He feels pain but has no neurons. Instead, he has a hydraulic mind, consisting of many inflatable cavities. The infla- tion of a cavity opens some valves and closes others. When you pinch his skin, certain cavities in his feet inflate. He experiences that process as pain. This motivates him to avoid getting pinched, just as our pain motivates us to avoid getting pinched. According to Lewis (1980), any credible theory of mind should account for the possibility of mad pain and the possibility of Martian pain.",
