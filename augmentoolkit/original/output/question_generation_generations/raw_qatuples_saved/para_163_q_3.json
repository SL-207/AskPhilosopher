    "paragraph": " If they are distinct features, then we shouldn\u2019t think that an explanation of one will necessarily explain the other. Consider a more ordinary case. Imagine that you are driving late at night on a cross-country road trip. Your mind wanders\u2014you start to think about that incident at work and worry about whether or not you\u2019ve left enough food for the cat. After a while you snap out of this meandering and realize that you\u2019ve been driving for some time with- out being aware of what you were seeing or doing (Armstrong 1981, p. 59). There is some sense in which you were conscious of the road and the scenery you were passing. It\u2019s not as though you were blind. As Block would say, you were access conscious of these things. But it might seem there is another sense in which you weren\u2019t aware of the flow of dotted lines on the road or the well-lit billboards you were passing. As Block would say, you were not phenomenally conscious of the road. Cases like this seem to add further support to his claim that the two sorts of consciousness he distinguishes can come apart and might require different explanations. If there can be access consciousness without phenomenal con- sciousness, what about vice versa? Can there be cases when we have phenomenal consciousness without access consciousness? Block sug- gests a somewhat ordinary case. Suppose that, in the middle of a deep conversation, you realize there is a pneumatic drill pummeling the pavement outside your office. Block thinks it plausible that you were hearing it all along. It\u2019s not as though you were selectively deaf. Nev- ertheless, you weren\u2019t consciously aware of the sound in the sense of having access consciousness of it\u2014it wasn\u2019t in a position to guide action or speech. DISCUSSION There are a number of ways to interpret what is going on in all of these cases. In the case of blindsight, there continues to be fruitful sci- entific research and challenging philosophical debate.",

    "question": "What is one possible implication of the fact that access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness can come apart?",
    "answer": "One possible implication is that they might require different explanations, as Block suggests that the two sorts of consciousness can come apart and might require different explanations.",
