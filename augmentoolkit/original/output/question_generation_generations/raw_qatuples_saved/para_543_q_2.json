    "paragraph": " The view advanced here is compatible with the view that we have an absolute duty to do what we can to bring about the obtaining of those states of affairs the obtaining of which would have greater positive total value than would the obtaining of other incompatible states of affairs that we can also bring about. Such a view, however, is not identical with what is usually regarded as consequentialism or utilitarianism. The pri\u00ad mary reason it is not is that included among the states of affairs the obtaining of which would be intrinsically good are not only non-moral states of affairs, such as someone's liking something such as a pleasing aesthetic object or engaging in some activity such as swimming or having some pleasant experience such as tasting good food when hungry, but also moral states of affairs, such as our keeping promises or someone's having something he has a right to have. Although the obtaining of various non-moral states of affairs is intrinsically good, so also is the obtaining of various moral states of affairs. Just as it can be intrinsically good that a person engage in some activity he likes such as swimming, so also it is intrinsically good that a person have something he has a right to have or that he keep a promise. Although the intrinsic value of moral objectives might presuppose that of various non-moral Moral and Non-Moral Value 85 objectives, in the sense that if nothing whatever had intrinsic value in a non-moral sense nothing could have such value in a moral sense, the intrinsic value of moral objectives is not reducible to that of those that are non-moral. For this reason the view advanced here is deontological rather than consequentialist or utilitarian. The duty to do what one can to bring about the obtaining of both moral and non-moral states of affairs the obtaining of which would be intrinsically good is what is sometimes referred to as an objective duty.",

    "question": "What is the relationship between moral and non-moral objectives when it comes to intrinsic value?",
    "answer": "While the intrinsic value of moral objectives may presuppose the value of various non-moral objectives, such as the idea that justice can only be meaningful if we value fairness, the intrinsic value of moral objectives is not reducible to that of non-moral objectives. This is because moral objectives have a unique value that cannot be fully captured by evaluating them solely in terms of their non-moral consequences.",
