    "paragraph": " In such situations the best we can reasonably hope to do is to reflect as carefully as we can, given the limited amount of time available for reflection in the situation in which we find ourselves, upon the circumstances of the situation, upon the varying weights of the various duties applicable to us in the situation, and upon the probable consequences of the various courses of action available to us in the situation. It is on the basis of such reflec\u00ad tion, which in certain situations must be very hasty indeed, that we must decide on which among the various courses of action available to us in the situation is the one we ought to take, while recognizing that what seems to us on reflection to be the right thing to do might very well not be the right thing to do. In general, the more complex the situation in which we find ourselves, and the less the amount of time we have for reflection, the greater the chances are that we might make some mistake in reflection and thereby do what might well turn out not to be the right thing to do. All the same, the most that can reasonably be expected of us is that, despite our susceptibility to error, we do that which, on reflec\u00ad tion, seems to us to be the right thing to do. Such a realistic position therefore recognizes not only that in existen\u00ad tial situations there are frequently conflicts between duties and between competing values, not all of which can be realized, but also that human reflection and judgment are fallible. The human condition and the con\u00ad dition of the world in which we live are therefore such that the realiza\u00ad tion of certain values inevitably involves the sacrifice of certain others. They also seem to be such that the inescapable fallibility of human reflection and judgment will inevitably continue from time to time to lead to the choice of things of lesser value over things of greater value. 1 34 The Nature of Value To some, such an assessment of the human condition and of the world in which we live might seem pessimistic.",
