    "paragraph": " And it is far from obvious that those phe- nomenal truths are structural (Alter 2023). The relevant phenomenal truths are truths such as the truth Mary would express when she first sees red and says, \u201cSo that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to see red!\u201d It\u2019s hard to see how that truth is about spatiotemporal causal structure. Proponents of the knowledge and conceivability arguments have also scrutinized Stoljar\u2019s description of the slugs\u2019 reasoning (Gertler 2009, Alter 2023). As Stoljar describes that reasoning, their conclu- sion is that the circular tiles aren\u2019t composed of any non-circular tiles. That false conclusion is clearly not justified. But why would the slugs draw that conclusion? Based on what they know, the only reasonable \u00adconclusion they could draw would be that circular tiles aren\u2019t com- posed of triangular tiles. And that conclusion is true. So, perhaps their arguments aren\u2019t fallacious after all. The analogous conclusion in the human case would be that consciousness isn\u2019t composed of a \u00adspecific sort of physical phenomenon, namely, structural phenomena\u2014\u00ad physical phenomena that can be fully explained in black-and-white media of the sort that Mary has access to in her black-and-white room. That conclusion does not show that consciousness is not com- posed of non-structural physical phenomena. On the other hand, it is not clear how physical phenomena could be non-structural.
