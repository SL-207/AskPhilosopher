    "paragraph": " In such a case, however, the exis\u00ad tence of the indifferent thing would be ex,trinsically rather than intrinsi\u00ad cally bad, just as the existence of some other indifferent thing might be extrinsically good because its existence prevents the existence of some\u00ad thing bad in its place. And just as the knowledge that the existence of a given indifferent thing prevents the existence of something bad might lead one to like its existence, so also the knowledge that the existence of another indifferent thing prevents the existence of something good might lead one to dislike its existence. If, however, the first is liked and the second disliked only because the existence of the first prevents the existence of something bad and that of the second the existence of something good, then the first is liked only because it is extrinsically good and the second disliked only because it is extrinsically bad. In order, then, to consider properly the question of whether it can be good to dislike an indifferent thing, we must abstract completely from the question of whether its existence is extrinsically good or bad and consider instead only the thing itself and the disliking of it. To achieve such an abstraction, we must also put aside the fact, indicated earlier, that disliking an indifferent thing is more likely than liking or indiffer\u00ad ence toward it to lead to unhappiness on the part of the person who dis\u00ad likes it, since this means only that such disliking is likely to be extrinsi\u00ad cally bad and not that it is intrinsically bad. Leaving aside, then, the question of whether the existence of a given indifferent thing and of whether disliking such a thing is extrinsically good or bad, we are left with the question of whether disliking such a thing can be intrinsically good. The correct answer would seem to be that it cannot be. It was maintained above that liking various indifferent things, espe\u00ad cially those to which we stand in no direct or indirect special relation, is sometimes a manifestation of a magnanimous disposition on the part of the person who likes them.",

    "question": "What does it mean for something to be \"intrinsically\" good or bad?",
    "answer": "When something is intrinsically good or bad, it means that its goodness or badness comes from within itself, rather than from external circumstances. In other words, its value or worth is inherent and does not depend on how it affects other things.",
