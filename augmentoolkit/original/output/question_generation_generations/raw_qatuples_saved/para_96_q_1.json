    "paragraph": "\" ( 4) \"That John is blind is bad.\" The first is to interpret them as saying that it is a fact or a proposition that is good or bad. The second is to interpret them as saying that it is good (or bad) that a given purported fact is ( or is not) in fact a fact or that it is good ( or bad) that a given proposition is true (or false). If we opt for the first interpretation we commit ourselves to the view that some facts or propositions are good and others bad. But if we opt for the second interpretation we do not commit ourselves to such a view. It seems strange to say that a fact, in the third sense of \"fact,\" is good ( or bad) and even more strange to say that a proposition is good ( or bad). But it is not in the least strange to say that it is good (or bad) that some purported fact is (or is not) a fact or that it is good ( or bad) that a given proposition is true ( or false). 28 The Nature of Value The second interpretation therefore seems preferable to the first. But, it may well be asked, if neither facts nor proposit\u043fons are either good or bad, in virtue of what is it good ( or bad) ( 1 ) that some purported fact is (or is not) in fact a fact and (2) that a given proposition is true (or false)? In answering this question it is important to remember that it is only facts in the third sense of \"fact,\" according to which facts are true propositions, that are neither good nor bad. Facts in the first sense of the term, according to which facts are states of affairs that obtain, and facts in the second sense of the term, according to which facts are the obtaining or the non-obtaining of states of 'affairs, can be good or bad. It is the goodness or badness of the obtaining and the non-obtaining of various states of affairs that determines whether it is good or bad ( 1 ) that some purported fact, in the third sense of \"fact,\" is in fact a fact and (2) that a given proposition is true (or false).",
