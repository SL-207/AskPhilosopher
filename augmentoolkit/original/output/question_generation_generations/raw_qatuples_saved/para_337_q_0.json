    "paragraph": " So, what do you say? Shall I give them a call? Bhavith is understandably freaked out by the news, and he is hesitant to make any big decisions on the spot. He goes home and talks things over with his spouse and family. Ultimately, he decides to go through with it. He schedules an appointment for the mindscan and uploading for two weeks later. During the procedure he is sedated. When he finds himself beginning to wake up, he isn\u2019t sure whether the proce- dure has even finished yet; but, as he opens his eyes, he realizes that he has a brand-new body\u2014similar to his old one, but revitalized and stronger. And he feels just like himself. \u201cIt works just as they prom- ised,\u201d he thinks with a sigh of relief. We could stop the thought experiment there, but let\u2019s add one twist. Moments after Bhavith wakes up, there is a knock at his door. When the person comes in, Bhavith is startled to realize that it\u2019s \u2026 Bhavith. It turns out that the facility\u2019s BDU (biological disposal unit) Mind Uploading 263 is currently malfunctioning, and so the team wasn\u2019t able to dispose of the biological body as they usually do. But, since they could tell that the biological heart was only days away from giving out, they decided to just let Bhavith live on in the biological body until he died a natural death, while also letting him live on in the android body. Staring at one another, neither Bhavith knows quite what to think. DISCUSSION If it is possible to upload one\u2019s consciousness to a computer and \u00adretain one\u2019s personal identity, then it looks like some version of the \u00adpsychological theory of personal identity must be correct. Since there is no physical continuity between the individual pre-upload and post-\u00adupload\u2014no continuity of brain and no continuity of body\u2014\u00ad successful uploading would render the physical theory of personal identity false. The question of whether uploading is compatible with the truth of the soul theory is less straightforward, since it might be that one\u2019s soul ends up being transferred to the machine along with one\u2019s consciousness.",
