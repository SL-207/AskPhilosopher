    "paragraph": " MPW could satisfy the condition that the No Low-Level \u00adMental Constitution constraint specifies. MPW does contain an infinite \u00addescent of mentality, but it need not contain an infinite descent of mentally constituted mentality. To see this, imagine a drawing made up of little circles arranged in a big circle. The big circle is circular in virtue of the arrangement of the little figures. But the fact that the ar- ranged figures are themselves circular is irrelevant to constituting the circularity of the big circle. The little figures might have been squares, and they nonetheless would have constituted a big circle because of how they were arranged. Likewise, although Alex\u2019s mentality exists in virtue of the arrangement of mental beings, the Bretts, the fact that the Bretts are mental beings is irrelevant to constituting Alex\u2019s \u00admentality. That\u2019s why physicalism could be true of MPW. Is the No Low-Level Mental Constitution constraint \u00adplausible? \u00adArguably, it is. What physicalists cannot abide is the presence of \u00admentally constituted mentality all the way down\u2014an infinite descent of levels where mentally constituted mentality exists. From the phys- icalist\u2019s perspective, the latter is no more palatable than fundamen- tal mentality is. However, the relevant notion of constitution is itself PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 132 controversial (Bliss and Trogdon 2021), and some physicalists might hesitate to rely on it. There is another factor to consider. As Brown (2017) points out, his MPW example also raises a problem for characterizing \u00adpanpsychism\u2014 the view that mentality occurs everywhere, even at the microphysical level. In recent philosophy of mind, panpsychism has increasingly been taken seriously (Goff et al. 2022). The problem for panpsychism is the reverse of the problem MPW raises for characterizing \u00adphysicalism. In MPW, mentality is everywhere. Yet MPW seems \u00adcompatible with the denial of panpsychism.",

    "question": "What is the controversy surrounding the notion of constitution, and how might it affect the relationship between physicalism and MPW?",
    "answer": "The controversy surrounding the notion of constitution is that some physicalists may hesitate to rely on it. This is because the notion of constitution is itself controversial, as discussed by Bliss and Trogdon (2021).",
