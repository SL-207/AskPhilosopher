    "paragraph": " (That last idea corresponds to the third kind of response above.) Despite Jackson\u2019s change of mind, the debate his Mary case inspired continues to flourish. Indeed, the case has led to a plethora of issues that Jackson did not even hint at when he created Mary. And, in many instances, the issues have led others to vary the case. One of the earliest such variant is Martine Nida-R\u00fcmelin\u2019s (1995) Marianna case. Like Mary, Marianna has lived in a black-and-white environment without seeing colors. But instead of going outside and encountering a rose or a ripe tomato, which she knows are typically colored red, she is brought into another room that contains only artificial objects (walls, tables, etc.) of various colors. The Marianna case helps us distinguish between knowing what it\u2019s like to see red and knowing something about the reference of color terms. Other variants of the Mary case serve other philosophical purposes. David J. Chalmers (2004, 2010) discusses Inverted Mary, who is just like Jackson\u2019s Mary except her color vision is red/green inverted (see Chapter 20), and Zombie Mary, who lacks consciousness entirely\u2014 despite saying upon leaving the room, \u201cAha! This is what it\u2019s like to see red!\u201d (see Chapter 7). Daniel Soljar (2005) describes Experienced Mary, who is returned to her black-and-white room and forgets some truths she learned outside, such as which things (such as firetrucks and ripe tomatoes) cause people to see red. Dennett (2007) conjures up RoboMary, a robotic variation. He also discusses Swamp Mary, who is created by a cosmic accident and is physically just like Mary after she returns to the black-and-white room and is no longer experienc- ing colors (see Chapter 24). Jesse J. Prinz (2012) discusses four other variants: Subliminal Mary, who is exposed to color patches only very briefly; Inverse Mary, who knows nothing about the brain but knows a lot about color experience; and two others (Arid Mary and Clumsy Mary).",

    "question": "What is the significance of the Marianna case?",
    "answer": "The Marianna case is significant because it helps distinguish between knowing what it's like to see red and knowing something about the reference of color terms. This distinction is important in understanding the philosophical implications of the Mary case.",
