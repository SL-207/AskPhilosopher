    "paragraph": " Other dualists have taken the second option (Mills 1996, Lowe 2003): they claim that mental properties do, as a matter of fact, over- determine their effects; while the physical cause is there, so too is an additional mental cause. This would be a curious state of affairs, but it seems possible. Even though it gives us an inelegant world, and one The Exclusion Problem 75 where it doesn\u2019t seem mentality is causally needed, perhaps there is room here to save our intuitions about mental causation. In recent years, a number of philosophers who reject the \u00adtraditional physicalist picture of mental phenomena have sought to avoid the ex- clusion argument by turning away from traditional property dualism to something like Russellian monism (see Chapter 4.) On that view, mental properties\u2014or proto-mental properties that are not \u00adthemselves mental but contain the seeds of mentality\u2014actually ground all of the physical properties in the world. In contrast to the traditional \u00adpicture, on which mental properties do not emerge until you get to the level of brains, Russellian monists see the world as having a mental or \u00adproto-mental base which ultimately explains the physical phenomena. Though this requires the denial of completeness, the Russellian mon- ist will argue that they can do so in an empirically \u00adunobjectionable way. For a critical discussion of the Russellian strategy as a solution to the exclusion problem see Howell (2015), and for a response see Alter and Coleman (2021).

    "question": "What is the relationship between the Russellian monist view and the idea of completeness?",
    "answer": "The Russellian monist view requires the denial of completeness, meaning that the world is not fully explained by physical properties. However, the Russellian monist will argue that this denial is empirically unobjectionable, and can be supported by empirical evidence.",
