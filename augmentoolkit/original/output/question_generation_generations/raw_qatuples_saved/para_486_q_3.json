    "paragraph": " The reason is that you would have the same reasons/evidence for believing that you will lose even if in fact you were to win. However, when it comes to your knowl- edge of where your car is, your car being in the parking lot does help explain your belief. Another way of developing the middle-ground sort of approach advocates distinguishing between statistical evidence and nonstatisti- cal evidence (Buchak 2014, Carter et al. 2016). The general idea here is that when your evidence, such as your knowledge of the lottery\u2019s odds, is purely statistical, it doesn\u2019t license you in believing outright. That is to say, it doesn\u2019t justify believing outright that you will lose. Instead, it only justifies believing that it is very likely that you will lose. However, when you have other sorts of evidence at play, you can (and should) outright believe. So, while you shouldn\u2019t believe (and don\u2019t know) that you won\u2019t win the lottery because your evidence for this is purely statistical, you should believe (and plausibly know) where your car is because you have nonstatistical evidence for this. Hence, it may be that these sorts of responses can be developed so that the \u201clotteries\u201d that seem to threaten our ordinary beliefs don\u2019t really do so. A different sort of response to the threat of lottery skepticism in- volves denying closure. The idea here is that you can know the or- dinary propositions without knowing the corresponding lottery propositions, but this doesn\u2019t matter. Essentially, this response denies premise (1) of the argument above. You can know p and fail to know that q despite the fact that you know that p entails q (see Trip to the Zoo pp. 37\u201341). As with other skeptical challenges, it is possible to appeal to con- textualism or pragmatic encroachment here too (see Going to the Bank pp. 48\u201352) (Baumann 2004). So, some respond to these sorts of lottery cases by arguing that it is appropriate to say that \u201cS knows that she can\u2019t afford a new Lamborghini\u201d in ordinary contexts, but in contexts where the possibility of S\u2019s winning the lottery has been made salient, it isn\u2019t appropriate to say that \u201cS knows that she can\u2019t afford a new Lamborghini.",

    "question": "What is contextualism, and how might it be used to respond to lottery skepticism?",
    "answer": "Contextualism is the idea that what it means to \"know\" something can depend on the context in which the claim is made. In the case of lottery skepticism, contextualism might be used to argue that in ordinary contexts, it is appropriate to say that \"you know you can't afford a new Lamborghini\", but in contexts where the possibility of winning the lottery has been made salient, it is not.",
