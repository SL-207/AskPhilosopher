    "paragraph": " Now imagine that someone you trust just as much tells you that not p. In this case, the second person\u2019s testi- mony is a rebutting defeater for the first person\u2019s testimony. It gives you a reason to think that what the first person told you is false. Now imagine that rather than someone giving you contradictory testimony, you learn that the person who told you p is not trustworthy like you thought but is prone to lie about things like p. It seems in this case you also lose the justification for p that the person\u2019s testimony provided. However, you don\u2019t gain reasons for thinking that p is false. Instead, in this case the justification provided by that person\u2019s testimony is undercut by learning that the person isn\u2019t trustworthy. We\u2019ve just seen examples of rebutting and undercutting defeaters. Importantly, such defeaters are themselves subject to defeaters. Let\u2019s take again the first version of the example. The first person tells you p, and then you gain a defeater because a second person tells you not p. Imagine that you now learn that while the first person is trustworthy, the second person is completely unreliable. In this case, the defeater that the second person\u2019s testimony provided you is now itself defeated, so you are left with the justification that the first person\u2019s testimony provided. You start with justification (because the first person tells you p), that justification is defeated (you get a defeater from what the second person tells you), and then your original justification is restored (the defeater you gained from the second person\u2019s testimony is itself defeated). That all said, the general idea of phenomenal conserva- tism is that its seeming to you that p gives you justification to believe that p as long as that justification isn\u2019t defeated by other information that you have.

    "question": "What is the challenge posed by background beliefs?",
    "answer": "Background beliefs, such as the idea that experts are generally more trustworthy than non-experts, can be a challenge to epistemological theories, because they can influence our justification for beliefs in ways that aren't always obvious.",
