    "paragraph": " Now suppose my twin and I are joined at the skull and share some brain matter, as seems to be the case with some craniopagus twins (conjoined twins with a fusion of the skull). Sup- pose we share a region that is the neural correlate for a particular pain. \u201cOw!\u201d we both say at once. Can we be said to be having the same token pain? This is a tricky case, but the jig analogy suggests that, even if pains are individuated by their bearers, two subjects of this sort who overlap in a peculiar way might well share a token pain. Maybe minds can combine after all. PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 282 This can be resisted, though, and probably depends upon additional metaphysical issues concerning the nature of subjects and their re- lationship to conscious states. If one is both a substance dualist and a property dualist, for example, one might well say that, while two non-physical subjects can have states caused by the same brain, the states are themselves still distinct. While a physicalist cannot say this, exactly, they still typically distinguish between what some philosophers call the core realizer of a token pain and its total realizer (Shoemaker 1981). Suppose a certain region of the brain, which we\u2019ll call the phi region, is activated when a person has a specific token pain experience. Call this the pain\u2019s narrow realizer. It is doubtful that if that piece of neural tissue were activated in a petri dish there would be pain there. It needs to be integrated in a working brain\u2014the total realizer for the painful mental state. Given this distinction, the physicalist could main- tain that, in the case of the craniopagus twins, there is only one narrow realizer for the pain, but there are two token feelings of pain. Each of those feelings is individuated by different total realizers. Pains on this view are still unlike playing cards\u2014even if there is a shared physical base that \u201clights up\u201d when a subject is in pain, there are two pains.",

    "question": "What would happen if the neural tissue responsible for a specific pain experience were activated in a petri dish?",
    "answer": "It is doubtful that there would be pain in the petri dish, even if the neural tissue were activated. The neural tissue needs to be integrated in a working brain in order for the pain to be experienced. This suggests that the physical basis of pain is not sufficient to account for the subjective experience of pain.",
