    "paragraph": " It is evident, however, that each of these ways of proving that a given thing is intrinsically good or bad rests ultimately on the claim that something else is intrinsically good or bad. In the first way the argument rests on the claim that all instances of a given genus, such as mean\u00ad spiritedness, are intrinsically bad; in the second on the claim that the opposite, such as magnanimity, of something held to be intrinsically bad, such as mean-spiritedness, is intrinsically good; and in the third on the claim that any instance of the kind, k, that has the properties f, g, h is intrinsically good. Sometimes the claims on which such arguments rest can themselves be proved by appealing to still other claims the truth of which is more evident. Thus one might attempt to prove the truth of the claim that mean-spiritedness is intrinsically bad by arguing that it is the opposite of magnanimity, the intrinsic goodness of which is seen or at least assumed to be more evident than is the intrinsic badness of mean-spiritedness. Is there, however, a claim the truth of which is more evident than the truth of the claim that magnanimity is intrinsically good to which an appeal can be made to prove the truth of the latter claim? If there is, is there still some other claim the truth of which is more evident than that of the claim in terms of which the intrinsic good\u00ad ness of magnanimity is proved? It is evident that this process cannot go forever. Finally we must accept without proof some claim to the effect that a given thing is intrinsically good or bad if we are to prove that anything at all is so. 5 To some this might seem an unsatisfactory state of affairs. If, how\u00ad ever, nothing can be known without proof, then nothing can be known. If, that is, we can know that p is true only if we know that q is true and that q entails p, and if we can know that q is true only if we know that r is true and that r entails q, and so on without end, then we can know nothing other than perhaps that q entails p and that r entails q, etc.",

    "question": "What is the problem with trying to prove that a thing is intrinsically good or bad?",
    "answer": "The problem is that each attempt to prove that a thing is intrinsically good or bad ultimately relies on some other claim that is also considered good or bad, and this process cannot continue indefinitely.",
