    "paragraph": " That is, it might be that, not just in MPW but also in reality, everything is infinitely decomposable and there are no fundamental physical phe- nomena (Schaffer 2003). And that possibility should be compatible with physicalism. So, an explanation of that compatibility is needed if, as Brown contends, MPW shows that Montero\u2019s solution fails. Two alternative solutions have been proposed. Both follow \u00adMontero\u2019s template: they explain how physicalism could be true in MPW by specifying necessary conditions on physicalism that MPW satisfies. But the specified conditions differ from Montero\u2019s. She \u00adidentified a pattern of infinite decomposition that is (she thought) \u00adincompatible with physicalism. By contrast, the first alternative \u00adsolution identifies a type of mentality that is incompatible with physical: the type that does not conform to Brown\u2019s compositional account of mentality\u2014 that is, mentality that something has but not solely in virtue of the Brains within Brains 131 arrangement of its constituent parts (Alter 2022). This suggests an Only Compositional Mentality constraint: physicalism is true only if all mentality is merely compositional (in the sense of the composi- tional account of mentality). The thesis helps support the claim that physicalism could be true of MPW: physicalism is compatible with the existence of compositional mentality, no matter how such men- tality is distributed\u2014even if such mentality is present at every level, as in MPW. However, there\u2019s a snag: despite what Brown suggests, it\u2019s not so clear that all versions of physicalism entail the compositional account of mentality. The second alternative solution combines insights of the other two, identifying both a pattern of infinite decomposition that\u2019s incompati- ble with physicalism and a type of mentality that\u2019s incompatible with physicalism (Alter et al. 2022). The proposal is based on the following No Low-Level Mental Constitution constraint: physicalism is true only if there\u2019s neither (a) fundamental mentality nor (b) an infinite descent of mentally constituted (mentally composed) mentality\u2014that is, an infinite descent of phenomena that are constituted by mental phenomena.",
