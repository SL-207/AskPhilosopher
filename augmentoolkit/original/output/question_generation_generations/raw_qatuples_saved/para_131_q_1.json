    "paragraph": " The reason for this is that given the way Peter\u2019s seeming is caused, it would be a matter of luck (similar to a Gettier- style case) if he managed to believe the truth about the pebble being gold. One way to explain why Peter would be lucky in this sense is that, unlike Patricia, his seeming that the pebble is gold isn\u2019t produced by a properly functioning cognitive faculty of gold detection, but instead by his wishful thinking (Moretti 2020, McCain and Moretti forthcoming). Hence, even if correct, Peter wouldn\u2019t be able to know that the pebble is gold on the basis of his seeming. Thus, Peter\u2019s belief lacks warrant. There are also responses to this sort of case that yield the result that Patricia, but not Peter, has justification that are not friendly to phenomenal conservatism. One such response is that offered by relia- bilism. A reliabilist can insist that what makes it the case that Patricia, but not Peter, is justified is that only Patricia is reliable at distinguish- ing gold from other things (Lyons 2016). Another sort of response is to insist that contrary to phenomenal conservatism, whether or not a seeming is caused in the right way determines whether the seeming provides justification (Siegel 2017). On this response, Peter\u2019s cognitive process, which leads to his seeming, is irrational because it\u2019s simply wishful thinking. This response contends that irrational processes can only generate seemings that fail to provide justification. COGNITIVE PENETRATION 161 RECOMMENDED READING SEMINAL PRESENTATIONS Markie, P. 2005.

    "question": "What is the main difference between Peter and Patricia in terms of their justification for believing that the pebble is gold?",
    "answer": "One difference is that Patricia is reliable at distinguishing gold from other things, whereas Peter is not. This is according to a reliabilist perspective that suggests that what makes it the case that Patricia, but not Peter, is justified is that only Patricia is reliable at distinguishing gold from other things.",
