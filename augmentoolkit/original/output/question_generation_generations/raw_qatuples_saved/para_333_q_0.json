    "paragraph": " A different response takes onboard Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s (1969) idea of \u201chinge propositions\u201d. Basically, this response holds that there are certain things that you are simply entitled to believe because of their role in your cognitive life (Wright 2004). One of the things you are entitled to believe in this sense is that you aren\u2019t deceived by Des- cartes\u2019 demon. So, this response maintains that you can know things about the world around you even if you don\u2019t have reasons to reject the possibility that you are deceived by a demon because you are en- titled to believe that you aren\u2019t deceived in this way. A final response involves arguing that the sort of scenario depicted isn\u2019t really a skeptical scenario at all (Chalmers 2010). The idea here is that even if you were to somehow discover that you are being tricked by a demon, this wouldn\u2019t make your ordinary beliefs about the world around you false. Rather, this discovery would allow you to learn about the fundamental nature of ordinary objects. You would learn that things like tables and chairs are very different than you thought\u2014they aren\u2019t made of tiny particles, but instead they are patterns of stimulation that the demon gives you. In other words, learning that you are being af- fected by Descartes\u2019 demon would amount to learning metaphysics, or perhaps it would be something akin to learning fundamental physics.
