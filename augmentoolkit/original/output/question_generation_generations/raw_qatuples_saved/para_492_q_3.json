There are not only our thoughts, feelings, and experiential states; there is also something that has those states. This doesn\u2019t seem to be just a random assumption: we seem certain of its truth. In the western tradition, Descartes in- sists that even given radical doubt about the existence of the external world\u2014including doubt that we have bodies\u2014each of us can none- theless be certain that we exist. Cogito ergo sum: I think therefore I am. On the face of it, my knowledge that I exist doesn\u2019t depend upon my knowledge about the external world. And, whatever else my existence might involve, it involves the existence of me\u2014that is, my self. It seems natural to think that we know about this self via introspection. But Hume (1739/1978), and long before him the Buddha, questioned this claim. In their view, the self is in fact particularly elusive. THE CASE Take a second and survey what you find in experience.

Maybe you\u2019ll also find auditory experiences of the sounds from the cars outside or the internal melody of an earworm.",
