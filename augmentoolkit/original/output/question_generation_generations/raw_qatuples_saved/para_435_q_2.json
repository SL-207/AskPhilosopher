    "paragraph": " If, however, neither liking nor disliking an indifferent thing can be either good or indifferent, and if being indifferent toward such a thing is bad, then any possible attitude one could take would be bad. Although one of these attitudes might be better and one worse than the other two, all would be bad. Given that there are indifferent things, this would be a bad, or at least an undesirable, outcome. Given also that it is appropriate or good to dislike bad things, it would then be appropriate or good to dis\u00ad like any of the possible attitudes one could or does take toward indif\u00ad ferent things. A fourth possible extreme answer is that the appropriate attitude to take toward indifferent things is to like them all. On such a view liking indifferent things is good, disliking or being indifferent to them bad. The proponent of such a view could readily admit that it is better to like good than to like indifferent things and also that it is inappropriate or bad to like indifferent things as much as or more than good things. But, as we have seen, from the fact that a is better than b it does not follow that b is bad or indifferent. The present view, despite what probably will seem to most to be its initial implausibility, does have a certain attractiveness. For one thing, a person who likes all the indifferent things of which he has experience or knowledge would appear thereby to manifest a greater generosity of spirit than does the person who likes only good things and remains indifferent to all indifferent things. Such generosity would be especially evident in the attitude such a person would adopt toward other persons, who by no means would always merit the love (if we may move from liking to loving) he, through his magnanimity, would bear them. Unlike the person who endeavors to love others only to the precise degree to which they merit being loved, the magnanimous person, rather than calculatingly attempting to apportion his love to others so that he loves them neither more nor less than they merit being loved, would love them more than he would doubtless do were he to engage in such precise calculations of the merits of o\u0459hers.",
