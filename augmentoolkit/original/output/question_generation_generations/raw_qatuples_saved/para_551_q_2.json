    "paragraph": " We are more magnan\u00ad imous still if we like not only the likings of indifferent things by our friends and relatives but also such likings by anyone, regardless of whether we like the things they like. Our magnanimity is even greater if we like in addition the likings of dumb animals even though we are indifferent toward or dislike various of the things they like. Other things equal, the person who likes a dog's, whether his own or a stranger's, liking to play with a rubber toy is more generous than the person who does not. More magnanimous still is the person who likes maggots' liking to eat garbage and who likes in advance the future liking of worms to eat the flesh of his cadaver as it lies moldering in its grave. Much modern moral philosophy and value theory has suffered from egocentrism, and most moral philosophy and value theory in the western tradition has suffered from anthropocen\u00ad trism. Just as the satisfaction of various of the desires of other human beings as well as those of one's own has value, so also the satisfaction Attitudes toward the Indifferent 191 of various of the wants of non-human as well as those of human ani\u00ad mals is good. Unbounded magnanimity of spirit consists, at least in part, in recognizing this and in liking the likings and the satisfaction of the wants of even such seemingly insignificant creatures as maggots and worms even though we do not like what they like or want what they want. What has been said about liking the likings of indifferent things by others even though we do not like what they like also applies, with the necessary changes, to liking the indifferences, but I think not the dislik\u00ad ings, of others when the things they are indifferent toward are indif\u00ad ferent. Other things equal, a person is more generous if he likes rather than dislikes another's indifference toward some indifferent thing he likes. It is important, however, to keep in mind that to like another's indifference toward or disliking something good, rather than mani\u00ad festing a magnanimous spirit, is instead bad.",
