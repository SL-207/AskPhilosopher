    "paragraph": " Whenever we use ordinary language meaningfully, there are multiple, mutually inconsistent things that our words could mean, and there is no fact of the matter about which of those things is correct. Quine uses the case we consider in this chapter to help motivate these startling results. THE CASE Imagine that you\u2019re an explorer in an unfamiliar place. You come across a tribe of people who speak a language that is wholly un- known to you. You try to write a translation manual that translates sentences of their language into English. They say \u201cGavagai!\u201d when a rabbit scurries by. What does that translate into, in English? \u201cThere goes a rabbit!\u201d? At first, that seems reasonable. After all, that\u2019s what you\u2019d probably say if you retained your mastery of English but found yourself in the position of the person saying \u201cGavagai!\u201d But then you realize that there are other possibilities\u2014for exam- ple, \u201cThere goes an undetached part of a rabbit!\u201d and \u201cThere goes a temporal stage in a rabbit\u2019s life history!\u201d And you remind yourself that you\u2019re concerned with what the people of the tribe mean, not with what you yourself might have said. Still, you think, it was an actual rabbit that scurried by, not merely an undetached rabbit part or a rabbit stage. But then you remember two other things. First, the translation manual should concern \u201cGavagai!\u201d as that sentence is used generally, not just on this one occasion. For that reason, you shouldn\u2019t assume that the fact that there was actually a rabbit present plays an es- sential role in determining the sentence\u2019s meaning. The same sentence might be prompted by, for example, seeing a cleverly disguised fake rabbit. Second, you\u2019re concerned with meaning in an objective, scien- tific sense. You realize that, as Quine (1960, p. 31) puts it, the relevant stimulus for the utterance of \u201cGavagai!\u201d is \u201cthe pattern of chromatic irradiation of the eye\u201d that the rabbit-sighting caused in the person you are observing\u2014a pattern that might as easily have been caused by a fake rabbit.",

    "question": "What is the problem in translating the word \"Gavagai!\" from an unknown language into English?",
    "answer": "The problem is that there are multiple possible meanings for the word \"Gavagai!\", such as \"There goes a rabbit!\", \"There goes an undetached part of a rabbit!\", or \"There goes a temporal stage in a rabbit's life history!\" It is unclear what the actual meaning of the word is, and it is not possible to determine the correct translation based on a single occurrence of the word.",
