    "paragraph": " Surely, however, to say that a given thing is in\u00ad trinsically good because it has a given property, exemplifies a given uni\u00ad versal, or satisfies a given concept is not to say that it is intrinsically 64 The Nature of Value good because it is intrinsically good. To say that a given thing is good because it has a certain property, exemplifies a certain universal, or sat\u00ad isfies a certain concept is to explain why it is good, but to say it is good because it is good not only explains nothing but does not even attempt to explain anything. Although the goodness of a given thing supervenes upon its having certain properties, exemplifying certain universals, or satisfying certain concepts, its goodness is not identical with, reducible to, or definable in terms of any of the latter. From the fact, however, that evaluative concepts cannot be defined adequately in terms of non-evaluative concepts, regardless of whether the latter be concepts of psychological phenomena or of phenomena that are not psychological in character, it does not follow that they cannot be defined in terms of other evaluative concepts. We have al\u00ad ready seen that certain evaluative concepts-such as those of extrinsic value (whether instrumental or contributory), total value, and positive, negative, and neutral value-are definable in terms of other evaluative concepts. The question before us is that of whether the concepts of in\u00ad trinsic goodness and badness can be so defined. Such a definition of these concepts would be better in at least one respect than definitions of them in terms of non-evaluative concepts, since all definitions of the latter type commit what may be labeled \"the non-evaluative fallacy,\" whereas definitions in terms of evaluative concepts do not. A number of such definitions can be and have been offered-so many, in fact, that it would be tedious to attempt to list them all. Fortunately, however, there is no need to attempt to compile such a list, since they all suffer from a certain fatal defect I shall endeavor presently to indicate.",

    "answer": "To say that the concept of goodness is not identical with, reducible to, or definable in terms of certain properties or concepts means that goodness cannot be fully explained or understood in terms of those properties or concepts alone. It means that the concept of goodness has a unique and inherent nature that cannot be reduced or defined solely in terms of other concepts.",
