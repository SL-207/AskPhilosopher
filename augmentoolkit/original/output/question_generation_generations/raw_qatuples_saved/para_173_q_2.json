    "paragraph": " Even PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 102 if a machine cannot pass for human, it might nonetheless have be- havioral manifestations of consciousness, and we might have other good reasons to think that is genuinely conscious. Schneider\u2019s AI Consciousness Test (ACT) aims to determine whether the machine has developed views of its own about consciousness, and whether it is reflective about and sensitive to the qualitative aspects of experience. If so, that would give us reason to think that it is genuinely conscious and not just faking it. She also describes another test called the chip test. In contrast to ACT, the chip test focuses not on machine behavior but on machine composition. Suppose that there are technological devices that, when integrated into a human brain, seem to support the presence of consciousness. Schneider suggests that if there are ma- chines that utilize this same technology, then we should take seriously the possibility that they are conscious. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that when Turing proposed his imitation game, he based it on a different kind of imitation game\u2014one involv- ing a man, a woman, and an interviewer of either sex. In this game, the man is trying to convince the interviewer that he is the woman. Whether and how this gendered imitation game influences the way we should think about Turing\u2019s imitation game has been the subject of some discussion, with some arguing that it has no relevance for how the test should be understood (e.g., Piccinini 2000) and others arguing the reverse (Genova 1994, Kind 2022).
