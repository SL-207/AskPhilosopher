    "paragraph": " As advertised on the Grand Canyon\u2019s website: Unparalleled views of one of the world\u2019s Seven Natural Wonders await you at Grand Canyon West on Skywalk. This breathtaking 10-foot wide, horseshoe-shaped glass bridge extends 70 feet out over the rim of the Grand Canyon, giving you a clear view 4,000 feet to the Canyon floor be- low. There\u2019s simply no thrill like stepping out on glass thousands of feet in the air, yet there\u2019s no need to be nervous\u2014Skywalk is strong enough to hold seventy fully loaded 747 passenger jets. (https://grandcanyonwest.com/things-to-do/skywalk/) PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 208 In the first five years after its opening, more than 1.8 million people vis- ited Skywalk, and in January 2020 attendance hit the 10 million visitor mark. Presumably, visitors to Skywalk believe it is safe. They have read the statistics, and they see all the people safely walking across it. And it\u2019s hard to believe that anyone would step out onto a bridge that high if they really had any doubt that they were in danger. Yet it is not at all uncommon for people to hesitate before stepping out. Some end up refusing to go through with the experience, despite having paid a hefty admission fee. And even those who do manage to make it to the center of the bridge are likely to feel a rush of vertigo as they do so. Despite their belief that everything is safe, it\u2019s as if there\u2019s some inner voice yell- ing at them \u201cDanger! Danger! Really high! Long way down! Get back!\u201d But why are people at Skywalk in this kind of state, given their firm belief that everything is safe? Why do they hesitate? As Tamar Gendler (2008a) puts it, there is a belief\u2013behavior mismatch, and this presents us with a puzzle. And the case of Skywalk is not the only sit- uation where this kind of puzzle arises. Empirical studies have shown that people are uncomfortable eating fudge that has been formed in the shape of dog poop, that they are hesitant to eat soup out of a brand-new bedpan, and that they are disinclined to drink sugar water that has been labeled \u201cpoison.",
