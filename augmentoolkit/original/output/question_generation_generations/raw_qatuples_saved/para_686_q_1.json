    "paragraph": " PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 312 Finally, some have suggested that the puzzle arises in large part due to a mistaken or overly pessimistic picture of imagination and its role in decision-making (see, e.g., Campbell 2015). Arguing that imagi- nation is a skill, Amy Kind (2020) notes that some people are much better at imagining than others, just like some people are much better than others at juggling, ballroom dancing, or solving crossword puz- zles. Perhaps many, even most, people are unable to imagine what it\u2019s like to be a parent prior to having the experience. But that does not mean that no one can. People with skilled imaginations are better able to leverage the experiences that they have already had to extrapolate to new experiences. Moreover, even people who are not skilled imagin- ers can work to become better at imagining, just as people can work to become better jugglers, ballroom dancers, or crossword-puzzle solvers.
