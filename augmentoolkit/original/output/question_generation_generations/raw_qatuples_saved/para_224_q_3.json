DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-16 THE PUZZLE OF THE SPECIAL SCIENCES BACKGROUND Many, if not most, philosophers are physicalists. Those philosophers usually believe that a complete physics would be a fully general science, leaving nothing out. Nevertheless, many also believe that sciences with more limited domains\u2014the so called \u201cspecial sciences\u201d like psychology and biology\u2014are essential to getting a full picture of the world. The special sciences discover things physics does not. And they help us see nature\u2019s joints, so to speak, even if those joints aren\u2019t the fundamental ones. This view about the relationship between the sciences is often reflected in beliefs about the nature of the mind. THE CASE Two popular beliefs seem to be in tension: (1) physics is complete in the sense that everything that happens is covered by physical law, and if you fix everything described by physics, you fix the nature of the world as a whole; and (2) sciences such as psychology and biology dis- cover important truths about the world that physics does not capture. Can these views be reconciled? 13 PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 78 One reaction is concessive: the \u201cspecial sciences\u201d are just different ways of talking about the same events, perhaps at different levels of descriptions\u2014zoomed out or zoomed in\u2014or restricted to different contexts; but physics ultimately doesn\u2019t leave anything out.",

    "question": "What is one possible way to reconcile the two views mentioned in the previous question?",
    "answer": "One possible way to reconcile these views is to take a concessive approach. According to this view, the special sciences are just different ways of talking about the same events, perhaps at different levels of description or restricted to different contexts. In this view, physics ultimately doesn't leave anything out.",
