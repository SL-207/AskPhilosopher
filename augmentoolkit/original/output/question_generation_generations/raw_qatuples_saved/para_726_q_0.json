    "paragraph": " Much more recently, a negative answer has been suggested by Project Prakash, documented by Held et al. (2011), in which five congenitally blind children had their sight restored. The children were unable to visually identify differently shaped Lego blocks they had previously known by touch. Though these empirical results seem to point to an unequivocal negative answer to Molyneux\u2019s problem, they have been called into question by a number of critics. Those critics ar- gue, for example, that, because the visual systems of the patients aren\u2019t immediately fully functioning, we cannot tell whether the failure is PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 188 due to the difference between visual and tactile representations of space or, more simply, the inadequacy of the patient\u2019s visual system immediately after surgery (Toribio 2021).

    "question": "What is Molyneux's problem, and what is being tested in this problem?",
    "answer": "Molyneux's problem is a philosophical issue that questions whether a person who is born blind and has never experienced sight can recognize and identify an object by touch alone, after gaining sight for the first time. In other words, it tests whether the sense of sight can immediately provide the ability to recognize and identify objects that one has previously known by touch.",
