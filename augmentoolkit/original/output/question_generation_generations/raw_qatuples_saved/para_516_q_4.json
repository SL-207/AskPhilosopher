    "paragraph": " At the same time, however, what may be referred to as \"moral objectives\" are such that any moral objective has either intrinsic or extrinsic positive or negative value and therefore either positive or negative total value. As was pointed out in chapter 2, objectives are facts, which, in various senses of \"fact,\" are either states of affairs that obtain, the obtaining or the non-obtaining of states of affairs, or true propositions. Accordingly, moral objectives are moral facts, which are either moral states of affairs that obtain, the obtaining or the non-ob\u00ad taining of moral states of affairs, or true propositions to the effect that some moral state of affairs obtains or about the obtaining or the non\u00ad obtaining of some moral state of affairs. A moral objective or fact, in any of these senses of \"objective\" and \"fact,\" is an objective or fact that can be stated or described only by using some moral concept. Every moral fact, in each of these senses of \"fact,\" is such that intrinsic or ex\u00ad trinsic goodness or badness and thus some total value is predicable of it. This can be seen by taking in turn each of the moral concepts discussed in the previous section. Given any person, x, it is intrinsically good that x fulfills some ab\u00ad solute duty he has in a given situation and thus acts rightly and as he ought, that x performs a given supererogatory act, that x respects a 82 The Nature of Value given moral right, that x is morally good or performs some morally good act ( or action) or that some morally good psychological phenom\u00ad enon is predicable of x, or that x has a given moral virtue or that x is morally virtuous and thus is a morally good person. It is intrinsically good that any of these states of affairs obtains, that propositions to the effect that they obtain are true, and the obtaining of each is also intrin\u00ad sically good. On the other hand, it is intrinsically bad that x fails to ful\u00ad fill some absolute duty he has in a given situation and thus acts wrongly and fails to act as he ought, that x never performs any supererogatory acts, that x violates some right, that x is morally bad or performs some morally bad act ( or action) or that some morally bad psychological phe\u00ad nomenon is predicable of x, or that x has a given moral vice or that x is morally vicious and thus is a morally bad person.",

    "question": "What is the significance of moral concepts in describing moral objectives and facts?",
    "answer": "Moral concepts are essential in describing moral objectives and facts because they provide the language and framework for evaluating and understanding moral states of affairs. Without moral concepts, it would be difficult to describe and evaluate moral facts accurately.",
