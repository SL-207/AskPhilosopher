    "paragraph": " It is also necessary that ultimately we see that the premises are true if we are to know that the conclusion is true. Unless the premises are seen to be true the most the proof can establish is that if they are true the conclusion is too, either necessarily or with some degree of proba\u00ad bility. If the premises are only assumed and not seen to be true, the proof establishes only that if they are true the conclusion is too, not that it is true. Moreover, even in those proofs in which the premises are only assumed and not seen to be true, it is only the premises that can be assumed to be true and not the fact that the conclusion follows from them. Unless the conclusion is seen to follow from the premises we have only a series of assumptions, and such a series does not constitute a proof. The preceding considerations apply not only to value theory but also to any area of inquiry, regardless of whatever the area might happen to be. In value theory these considerations mean that if anything is to be proved to be either intrinsically or extrinsically good or bad, then cer\u00ad tain things must be known without proof to be intrinsically good or Definition, Proof, and Knowledge of Intrinsic Value 71 intrinsically bad through seeing that they are one or the other. In pre\u00ad vious chapters various examples have been given of things that are intrinsically good and of other things that are intrinsically bad, and in succeeding chapters other examples w1ll be given. I trust that the reader will see that at least some of these things are indeed intrinsically good and that at least some are intrinsically bad. Chapter 5 Moral and Non-Moral Value In chapter 5 it was argued that the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness are the central concepts of value theory and that the concepts of extrinsic value (including both instrumental and contributory value), total value, and positive, negative, and neutral value are explicable only in terms of the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness.",

    "answer": "In order to establish that something is intrinsically good or bad, it is necessary that it be seen to be one or the other through some process of reasoning or evidence. Simply assuming that it is good or bad is not sufficient.",
