    "paragraph": " 35). So, we would have a situation in which at one moment a person exists in a biological body, then there is a brief period (perhaps very brief) in which the person does not exist, and then a moment in which a person exists again in a computer\u2014a gap in their continued existence. Many philosophers reject the claim that entities (including persons) can have such a \u201cgappy\u201d existence. Things don\u2019t pop in and out of ex- istence. If this is right, then we have further reason for pessimism that the person survives the upload process. To mount a different kind of case for pessimism, Nicholas Agar (2016) proposes a thought experiment involving extraterrestrial \u00adscientists from the star Betelgeuse. These scientists are fascinated by humans, and, unbeknownst to any of us on Earth, they use long-range scanning technology to create blueprints of some of the humans they observe. They then use these blueprints to make human copies on their own planet. If you were one of the humans scanned by the scientists, would the copy they recreate on Betelgeuse be identical to you? Agar predicts that most of us would have the very strong intui- tion that the answer is no. As he goes on to argue, machine uploading parallels this kind of copying case. Alternatively, some pessimists deny that an upload could even be a conscious being, let alone the conscious being that is you (see Haus- keller 2012, Mandelbaum 2022). The upload scenario seems to presup- pose functionalism\u2014that is, it seems to presuppose that mental states are functional states. Insofar as we have reason to doubt that functional duplicates of conscious beings really have qualia (see Chapters 7 and 16), we would have reason to doubt that uploads are conscious. Finally, some philosophers take a position that is in one sense a kind of pessimism but perhaps is better seen as a way of rejecting this whole way of approaching the issue. According to Parfit (1984), identity is not what matters to us in survival.",

    "question": "What is the potential problem with the idea that a person can survive being uploaded into a computer, given the concept of a \"gappy\" existence?",
    "answer": "Many philosophers reject the idea that entities, including persons, can have a \"gappy\" existence. This means that they don't believe it's possible for a person to exist in a biological body, then not exist for a brief period, and then exist again in a computer. They believe that things don't pop in and out of existence.",
