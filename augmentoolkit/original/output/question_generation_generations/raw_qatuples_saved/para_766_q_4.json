    "paragraph": " In discussions of Nagel\u2019s bat case (see Chapter 5), it is often suggested that we can- not imagine what it is like to be a bat because a bat\u2019s echolocation experiences are too different from our experiences\u2014that the differ- ences are too great for us to make the appropriate extrapolations. But how different is too different? Although that question remains open, philosophers have recently begun to focus more on the nature of the imagination. And that has implications for our understanding of its limits. For example, Amy Kind (2020) suggests that, because imagina- tion is a skill, there might be skilled imaginers that are able to draw on prior experiences to imaginatively extrapolate to alien experiences to a surprising extent\u2014quite a lot farther than recreating the missing shade of blue.
