    "paragraph": " Indeed, one might also evaluate one's own valuings and evaluations and come to value, i.e., to like or to regard as good, some of them and to dislike or regard as bad others. A person's initial valuings are likely to be strenghtened if, upon evaluating them, he comes to value them, i.e., to like them or to regard them as good. If, however, he comes to dislike them or to regard them as bad, he might modify or abandon them. This, however, does not always happen, since 4 The Nature of Value the strength of one's initial likings or valuings might be greater than that of one's subsequent dislike of them. In such a situation, I might initially value something, x, subsequently come to dislike or to regard as bad my valuing x, yet nonetheless continue to value x, perhaps because my ini\u00ad tial liking of xis greater than my subsequent dislike of my liking of x. In such a situation I do not both like and dislike x; instead, I like x or re\u00ad gard it as good, yet also dislike or regard as bad my liking x. It is my liking x, not x itself, that I dislike or regard as bad. Yet despite my dis\u00ad like of my liking x I nonetheless continue to like x. Evaluations and valuings of evaluations and valuings are second\u00ad order phenomena that have as their intentional objects first-order phe\u00ad nomena consisting of evaluations and valuings of things that are not themselves evaluations and valuings. Such second-order phenomena therefore presuppose the corresponding first-order phenomena. The latter, however, are presupposed only as the intentional objects of the second-order phenomena and need not exist, occur, or have being inde\u00ad pendently of their being the objects of the second-order phenomena, just as the intentional objects of first-order valuings and evaluatings need not exist, occur, or have being independently or their being valued and evaluated. We frequently value and evaluate things that do not exist and that we know do not exist independently of our valuing and evalu\u00ad ating them.",

    "question": "Can a person's evaluative judgment exist independently of their re-evaluation of it?",
    "answer": "No, a person's evaluative judgment does not need to exist independently of their re-evaluation of it. Its existence is tied to being the object of re-evaluation.",
