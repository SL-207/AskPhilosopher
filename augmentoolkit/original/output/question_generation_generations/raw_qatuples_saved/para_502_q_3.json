    "paragraph": " Thus if John ap\u00ad points Paul rather than Peter to the position because he believes that Paul deserves it and Peter does not when in fact it is Peter rather than 80 The Nature of Value Paul who deserves it, he acts wrongly even though the motive moving him to act is morally good. If, that is, the motive moving a person to act as he does is that he believes the act to be right, then his motive is morally good regardless of whether his act is right or wrong. 7 In such situations, however, the concepts of moral goodness and badness presuppose the concepts of acting rightly or wrongly, since to be moved to perform a given act by a belief that the act is right presupposes the belief in question and thus the concepts of rightness and wrongness. Since, however, these two concepts do not presuppose those of moral goodness and badness, the first pair of concepts is more fundamental than the second. This, however, for the reasons given, does not mean that the second pair of concepts is reducible to the first. We turn now to the last of the concepts central to moral philosophy mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. These are the concepts of moral virtues and vices. These concepts presuppose in various ways the other concepts discussed above. To have various moral virtues is to be disposed to fulfill various duties, including the duty to respect rights and from time to time to perform supererogatory acts, and thus to act rightly and as one ought to act. A person is morally virtuous in the respects in which and in the degree to which he is so disposed and can have certain virtues without having others. He can be kind, for example, without being courageous and can be courageous without being kind. To have various vices, on the other hand, is to be disposed not to act in the ways in which one must act if one is to have the opposed virtues, and a person is morally vicious in the respects in which and in the degree to which he is so disposed.",
