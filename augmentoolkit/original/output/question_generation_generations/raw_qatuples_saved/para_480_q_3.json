    "paragraph": "). 2) You don\u2019t know the lottery proposition. 3) Therefore, you don\u2019t know the ordinary proposition. RESPONSES There are a number of responses to these sorts of lottery cases \u00ad(Hawthorne 2004). One response is to simply embrace the skeptical consequences. In other words, we might think that since you don\u2019t know the relevant lottery propositions, you don\u2019t know the corre- sponding ordinary propositions either. Of course, this would amount to a wide-ranging skepticism since a large number of the things we ordinarily think we know seem to entail knowing that we won\u2019t win various \u201clotteries\u201d. Which, of course, means that if you don\u2019t know that you won\u2019t win these lotteries, you don\u2019t know the corresponding ordinary propositions. Another response goes the other direction. This response accepts that you do know the ordinary propositions, and it insists that you know the lottery propositions as well. According to this response, even if you buy a lottery ticket, you know that you are going to lose. Typ- ically, those who opt for this sort of response attempt to offer some explanation of why it is that you buy a ticket even though you know that you are going to lose. For example, they may contend that per- haps you buy the ticket because it prompts you to enjoy imagining what it would be like if you were to have the money from the lottery. There are various responses that lie between these first two. These other responses attempt to limit how widely one\u2019s knowledge is af- fected by such lottery cases. For instance, one proposal along these lines is that knowing that p requires an explanatory link between the fact that p and one\u2019s belief that p (Nelkin 2000, Goldman 2008). LOTTERY SKEPTICISM 83 On\u00a0this account, it turns out that you don\u2019t know that you won\u2019t win the lottery or that you can\u2019t afford a Lamborghini, but it may turn out that you do know where your car is. The gist of this proposal is that there is no explanatory link between the fact of your losing the lottery, say, and your belief that you lost.",
