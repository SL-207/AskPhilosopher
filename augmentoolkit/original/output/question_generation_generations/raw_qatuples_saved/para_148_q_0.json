    "paragraph": " David isn\u2019t playing football; he\u2019s sitting in an armchair. What\u2019s more, David isn\u2019t even being deceived about what\u2019s going on like in some skeptical scenarios\u2014he still has all of the experiences he would nor- mally have while sitting in his chair watching TV. David\u2019s beliefs are simply out of touch with his experiences. Nonetheless, those beliefs cohere with one another, so coherentism seems to yield the result that David\u2019s beliefs are justified despite their obvious conflict with his experiences. RESPONSES One early pure coherentist response to this problem looked for a way out by adding further required beliefs for coherence. The general idea here is that in order for one\u2019s set of beliefs to really be coherent, one had to have beliefs that some of one\u2019s beliefs occur spontaneously and believe that such spontaneous beliefs are reliable (BonJour 1985). This is supposed to secure the role of experience in justification because JUSTIFICATION 164 beliefs caused by experiences are spontaneous and one would believe that such beliefs are reliable. Even the original supporter of this sort of response, Laurence BonJour, later abandoned it though, likely because it doesn\u2019t seem to actually address the problem. Even if it is true that such beliefs are required for coherence, and so for justification, it\u2019s plausible that Favre had these beliefs. After all, Favre was a normal hu- man, forming beliefs in the ways that normal humans do. And David, therefore, has the same required beliefs because he has all of the same beliefs as Favre. Hence, it\u2019s not clear how this additional requirement could actually block this problem for coherentism. A different sort of pure coherentist response involves arguing that the case envisioned here is actually impossible. Importantly, the im- possibility isn\u2019t because it\u2019s somehow impossible that cosmic radiation could cause someone to have beliefs like this.",

    "question": "What is the problem that David's situation poses for coherentism, a theory that holds that a set of beliefs is justified if it is coherent?",
    "answer": "David's situation poses a problem for coherentism because he has beliefs that are out of touch with his experiences, but those beliefs still cohere with one another. This seems to suggest that coherentism would conclude that David's beliefs are justified, despite their obvious conflict with his experiences.",
