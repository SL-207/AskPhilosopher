    "paragraph": " It is tempting to think that what makes a thought about something has to do with the history of the individual who has that thought, or perhaps the evolutionary process that gave rise to such a thought type. Sarah\u2019s thought is about her grandmother and not the lady next door because Sarah has been in contact with her grandmother and not the lady next door. But what if there were a creature without such a history? The answer to the general aboutness question, which emphasizes historical connections, would seem to imply that this creature wouldn\u2019t have intentionality at all. This ap- pears implausible to many. Chapter 24 concerns that problem. CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 137 It is tempting to think that, whatever makes a person\u2019s thoughts about something, it must be something about the particular person\u2014 the constitution of their brain, the way they feel, and so forth. But Chapter 25 presents an argument that challenges this assumption. At least some of our thoughts have the particular content they do partly because of our environment. When I think about water, I think about one thing: H2O. But if I grew up in a world where almost everything was the same but the thing people called \u201cwater\u201d and that ran in rivers and streams was not H2O but XYZ, my thoughts about water would be about XYZ. Things outside of our brains and bodies can deter- mine what content we are thinking. Philosophers often call this view about content externalism. Chapter 26 presents a thought experiment that supports a different sort of externalism. On this view, there can be extended minds in the sense that part of our mind\u2014the states and activ- ities that make up our minds\u2014can be located outside of our bodies. On this view, for example, a state of my iPhone might constitute one of my beliefs. Take Sarah\u2019s belief that her grandmother is from Peoria. On the extended-mind view, Sarah might have that belief even if it does not reside anywhere in her head.",

    "question": "What is the extended-mind view, and how does it differ from externalism?",
    "answer": "The extended-mind view is the idea that part of our mind, including the states and activities that make up our minds, can be located outside of our bodies. For example, a state of my iPhone might constitute one of my beliefs. This view differs from externalism in that it suggests that our minds can be extended to include external objects and systems, rather than simply being influenced by them.",
