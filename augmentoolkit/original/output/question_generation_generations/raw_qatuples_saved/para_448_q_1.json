    "paragraph": " In point of fact, 74 The Nature of Value however, the two concepts are correlative, since the concept of prima facie duty can itself be explicated only by using the concept of absolute duty. Thus to say of a given duty that it is prima facie is to say that in any given situation in which it is such a duty it would be an absolute duty if it were not overridden by some other conflicting prima f acie duty or countered by some other conflicting prima f acie duty of equal weight. Thus just as the concept of absolute duty was explicated by using the concept of prima f acie duty, so also the latter concept can be explicated only by using the former. The two concepts are therefore cor\u00ad relative, and neither is more fundamental than the other. This, however, is not to deny that there might be some duties, such as respect for per\u00ad sons, that are unconditionally absolute, in the sense that they cannot be overridden in any situation in which we might find ourselves. The account of the concept of duty presented above is such that it is more fundamental than the concepts of rightness and wrongness, which are definable in terms of the concept of duty. Thus in a given situation a person acts wrongly if and only if he fails to fulfill his weightiest prima facie duty, and thus his absolute duty, in that situation, rightly if and only if he does not fail to do so. It is conceivable, however, that a person might find himself in a situation to which none of his prima f acie duties apply, so that in that situation he has no prima facie duty to do anything at all. In such a situation he cannot act wrongly, so that anything he does he does rightly, in the sense that he does not act wrongly. The con\u00ad cept of acting rightly is therefore broader than that of acting wrongly, and more occasions, happily, are presented in which we can act rightly than in which we can act wrongly. On such occasions we can relax and not worry about acting wrongly.",

A person acts wrongly if and only if they fail to fulfill their weightiest prima facie duty in a given situation, and they act rightly if they do not fail to do so.",
