    "paragraph": " That all said, there is at least one very prominent response to dreaming skepticism that treats its differences from Descartes\u2019 demon as a key to settling the issue (Sosa 2007, Ichikawa 2008, 2009, 2018). There are two steps to this response. First, the response insists that dreams are like imaginings. It is because of this feature of dreams that we don\u2019t actually form beliefs about the content of our dreams while we are dreaming. Say, for example, you dream that you are holding a book. According to this response, you don\u2019t actually form a belief that you are holding a book. Instead, dreaming that you\u2019re holding a book is the same as it would be if you were to imagine holding a book when you\u2019re not. The second step is to rely upon the modal notion of safety. Recall from Promotions and Traveling Friends pp. 6\u201311 and A Strange County pp. 16\u201320 that S\u2019s belief that p is safe just in case in the closest worlds to this one where S believes that p, p is true. Since this response holds that we don\u2019t actually form beliefs in dreams, our be- liefs are safe with respect to dream worlds. Let\u2019s consider this carefully by examining how this would work with your belief that you are holding a book. The thought is this, your belief that you are holding a book counts as safe because even if a dream world is close to the actual world, it is still the case that in the closest worlds where you believe that p, p is true. Why is this? Because the worlds in which you believe that p are worlds in which you are awake and perceiving the book. In dream worlds, you don\u2019t actually believe that p, so it can\u2019t be that you believe that p when p is false in those worlds. Since this response holds that all that is necessary for your belief to count as knowledge is that it is true and safe, it maintains that you can know things about the world around you regardless of the possibility that you may be dreaming.",
