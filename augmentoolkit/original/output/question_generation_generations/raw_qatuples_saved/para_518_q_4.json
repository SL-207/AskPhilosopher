    "paragraph": " DISCUSSION In the wake of Burge\u2019s argument, externalism has become widely held. But not everyone is convinced. Some critics respond by chal- lenging Burge\u2019s argument. One move is to say that Arthritis-man\u2019s beliefs don\u2019t involve the concept of a disease that can\u2019t apply to a thigh condition (Crane 1991, Georgalis 1999, Wikforss 2001). Burge\u2019s mis- take is merely linguistic: he falsely believes that the public-language term \u201carthritis\u201d expresses his concept, rather than the more restrictive concept it actually expresses. Burge anticipates that move and gives several replies. For example, Arthritis-man and his doctor share some beliefs\u2014such as the belief that he has arthritis in his ankles. And Burge Twin Earth and Arthritis Man 157 argues that denying that Arthritis-man has the arthritis concept makes shared beliefs difficult to explain. Other critics of Burge challenge his assumption that our reactions to thought experiments should carry as much weight as he suggests they should (Cummins 1991, Chomsky 1995). Still others raise prob- lems concerning the distinction between \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d properties\u2014a distinction on which the debate about internalism rests. Brie Gertler (2012) argues that the standard ways of explicating that distinction all fail. For example, on one standard explication, the dis- tinction is spatial: internal properties are properties instantiated within the subject\u2019s skin, brain, or head; and external properties are properties not instantiated within the subject\u2019s skin, brain, or head. But then what about Descartes? Descartes, a dualist, would deny that mental content depends only on such spatially internal properties, since he doesn\u2019t see mental contents as being specifiable in spatial terms. He therefore comes out as an externalist. But, as Gertler notes, Descartes is standardly regarded as the archetypal internalist, particularly in light of his famous \u201cEvil Demon\u201d thought experiment, according to which we might have all the same beliefs even if an Evil Demon was tricking us into thinking there was an external world.",

    "question": "How does the \"Evil Demon\" thought experiment relate to the debate about internalism and externalism?",
    "answer": "The \"Evil Demon\" thought experiment, which suggests that we might have all the same beliefs even if an Evil Demon was tricking us into thinking there was an external world, is often cited as a challenge to internalism. This is because it seems to suggest that mental content can depend on external factors, even if we don't realize it.",
