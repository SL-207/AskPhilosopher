More specifically, what is the relationship between me and my body? According to one view, famously held by Plato and Descartes, I am something immaterial\u2014a soul, perhaps\u2014that \u201cresides in\u201d or \u201coccupies\u201d a body. The nature of this residency is somewhat tricky, but on this dualist view one thing at least is clear: I am not identical to my body. This is also true on the psychological theory of personal identity (see Chapters 39, 41, and 42), according to which what I am from time to time is a matter of there being certain psy- chological connections, such as memory connections, between my past and future selves. According to this theory, whether I\u2019m a soul or body is less relevant than whether these connections exist. Not all views place such an emphasis on psychology, however. According to physical theories of personal identity (see Chapter 41), one\u2019s identity over time consists in certain physical facts. According to Eric Olson\u2019s physical theory, called animalism, people are biological creatures: I, for example, am identical to a human animal. This view can seem ex- tremely natural, but many philosophers\u2014even those not tempted by 43 PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 268 dualism\u2014resist it.",

    "question": "What is the implication of physicalism for the idea of personal identity?",
    "answer": "The implication of physicalism is that personal identity is determined by physical facts, rather than by immaterial factors such as a soul or psychological connections.",
