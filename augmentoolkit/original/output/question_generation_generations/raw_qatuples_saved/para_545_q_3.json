    "paragraph": " For example, some propose that knowing what it\u2019s like for bats to echolocate is really just possessing the ability to imagine such experiences\u2014and that Nagel is wrong to infer anything about the nature of such experiences from inability to imagine them (Nemirow 1980). Other philosophers concede that Nagel\u2019s reflections undermine the claim that the nature of conscious experiences can be objectively explained\u2014and then go on to detach physicalism from that claim (Howell 2013). Physicalism, they argue, is a metaphysical theory, about what experiences are, and it therefore need not imply the epistemological claim that the physical nature of experiences is objectively explicable. Whether such a detachment is defensible is controversial (Chalmers 1996, 2003). Still others challenge assumptions they take to be implicit in Nagel\u2019s reasoning. For example, Kathleen Akins (1993) argues that Nagel errs in relying too much on the assumption that introspection (a process by which one can know about one\u2019s own mental life) is a reliable source of information. More specifically, she suggests that Nagel\u2019s reasoning con- cerns \u201cpure phenomenal experience\u201d\u2014something entirely separate from other mental features, such as representing the world (see Chapters 23\u201327). But, Akins argues, introspection does not show that there is any such thing. In response, Nagel could deny that his reasoning concerns pure phenomenal experience; it is at least unclear why we should think it does. There\u2019s also a question of whether bat echolocation experiences are really as different from human experiences as Nagel suggests. Blind people sometimes learn to echolocate, and most people use echolo- cation to some degree (Schwitzgebel and Gordon 2000). So, perhaps Nagel\u2019s example is not ideal for his purposes. But it\u2019s only an example. There might be better actual examples. Can someone who has been blind from birth understand what it is like to see (see Chapters 6 and 32)?",

    "answer": "Some potential limitations of Nagel's example are that blind people can learn to echolocate, and that most people use echolocation to some degree, which may suggest that the experience of echolocation is not as different from human experiences as Nagel suggests.",
