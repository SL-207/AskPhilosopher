    "paragraph": " Usually, they contain chemically distinct pho- topigments. Due to genetics, it\u2019s likely that sometimes (though rarely) G-cones contain the photopigment that R-cones usually contain, and vice versa. According to Nida-R\u00fcmelin, this can result in red/green qualia inversion. Moreover, she suggests that the resulting inverts might be behaviorally indistinguishable from non-inverts. Others argue that the scientific evidence points in the opposite direction\u2014that is, that such behaviorally indistinguishable inverts are empirically impossible (e.g., Hardin 1988, Hilbert and Kalderon 2000). For example, for behaviorally indistinguishable inverts to exist, experiences of red and green would have to be symmetrical, and that is not so. For example, C. L. Hardin (1988) argues that, for humans, red is \u201cwarm\u201d whereas green is \u201ccool.\u201d Perhaps that particular asymmetry could also be inverted (Block 1990), but some argue that others can- not (Hilbert and Kalderon 2000). Some of the debate concerns not just red/green inversion, but inversion of the entire color spectrum; traditionally, inverted qualia cases are called \u201cinverted spectrum\u201d cases. But red/green qualia inversion suffices for the central philosophical arguments, such as the argument against functionalism. To succeed, the inverted qualia argument against functionalism \u00adrequires more than behavioral indistinguishability. Invert would have to be functionally indistinguishable from non-inverts. Her phenomenally red experiences would have to relate to her other mental states in the way phenomenally green experiences do in non-inverts, and vice versa. That is even harder to vindicate empirically. However, at least as stated above, the argument against functionalism requires only that function- ally indistinguishable inverted qualia are possible, in the broadest (meta- physical) sense (Shoemaker 1982, Block 1990, \u00adChalmers 1996). Indeed, the inverts need not even be human.",

    "question": "According to the author, what is required for the argument against functionalism to be successful, in a broader, metaphysical sense?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that, in a broader sense, the argument against functionalism requires only that functionally indistinguishable inverted qualia are possible, in the sense that they can exist or be conceived of. This does not necessarily require that actual inverted qualia individuals exist, but rather that the possibility of such individuals can be conceived of.",
