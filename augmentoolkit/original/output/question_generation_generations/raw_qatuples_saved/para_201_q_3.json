    "paragraph": " If the thought experiment is coherent, and it seems to be, it does suggest that self-awareness does not depend on a sensory awareness of the body. Some interpreters see the floating man argument as being more concerned with other special features of self-awareness (Alwishah 2013). It might be concluded, for example, that every case of aware- ness is a case of self-awareness. Though the floating man doesn\u2019t per- ceive himself in any obvious way\u2014by vision, taste, smell, etc.\u2014he is still aware that he exists. This self-awareness is immediate, in the sense that it requires no intermediary awareness\u2014no awareness of some- thing else by which one becomes aware of the self, in the way that I become aware of the dog in the yard by hearing its bark. One can be aware of the self without being aware of anything else. Avicenna argu- ably goes further, claiming that self-awareness doesn\u2019t even require the activity of thought\u2014self and self-awareness are in some sense identical (Alwishah 2013, pp. 62\u20133). However, it is difficult to see how either of these claims of immediacy follows from the floating man thought experiment, at least directly. After all, the floating man is presumably engaging in conscious thought and is aware of those thoughts. If the floating man is no longer engaging in any intellectual activity at all, it is no longer obvious that he is self-aware. Though the debate about the possibility of disembodied \u00adexistence has medieval origins, the discussion remains alive and well today, as evidenced by the \u201cdisembodied pain\u201d thought experiment to be \u00addiscussed in Chapter 3. Not only is there active debate about the soundness of floating man-type arguments\u2014which is echoed in \u00addiscussions of zombies (see Chapter 7)\u2014there is live debate of the role of bodily awareness in self-awareness, with some philosophers (such as Gertler 2011, esp. Chapter 7, and Howell 2023) siding with Avicenna that one can be self-aware without being bodily aware, and with others (such as Berm\u00fadez 1998) insisting otherwise.",

    "question": "Does the floating man thought experiment demonstrate that self-awareness requires no intermediary awareness?",
    "answer": "No, it is not clear that the floating man thought experiment demonstrates that self-awareness requires no intermediary awareness. The fact that the floating man is presumably engaging in conscious thought and is aware of those thoughts suggests that some intermediary awareness may be required for self-awareness.",
