    "paragraph": " The Puzzle of Too Many Minds 269 Call the space occupied by you sitting in your chair the chairspace. Now consider the following argument: 1. There is a brain in the chairspace. 2. The brain in the chairspace is thinking. 3. The brain is not identical to the human animal. 4. The human animal is in the chairspace. 5. There are not two things thinking in the chairspace\u2014that would be too many minds! 6. Therefore, the human animal is not thinking. This argument seems to turn the animalist\u2019s reasoning against \u00aditself. The premises seem plausible, and, given their similarity to the \u00adanimalist\u2019s own premises, it seems any response to the argument can be adjusted to be used as a response to the thinking animal argument as well. While some philosophers opposed to animalism are substance \u00addualists, believing that a person is identical with a soul, many are not. These philosophers, many of whom adopt a psychological view of personal identity (see Chapters 39, 41, and 42), think that, though we are material beings, we are nonetheless not identical with human ani- mals. It seems, for example, that if my body is in a vegetative state with no consciousness, though the animal lives, I\u2019m not there anymore. My identity over time seems to be more closely related to my psycholog- ical continuity than to bodily continuity. If somehow my brain (and therefore my psychology) were transplanted into a different human animal, I would be in that new body. How can the materialist say this without running into the problem of too many minds? Lynne Rudder Baker (2000) attempts to thread the needle by appealing to a classic puzzle in metaphysics: the statue and the clay. Suppose an artist molds a lump of clay into a statue of the Buddha. What is the relation between the statue and the clay? It is natural to say the statue is identical with the clay. But there are problems with that answer. It seems the clay existed before the statue.",

    "question": "Consider the chairspace, which is occupied by both a brain and a human animal. Why can't there be two things thinking in this space?",
    "answer": "It's argued that if there were two things thinking in the chairspace, that would be \"too many minds\", which is a problem.",
