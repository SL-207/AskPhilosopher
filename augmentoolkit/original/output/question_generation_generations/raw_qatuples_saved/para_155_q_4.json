    "paragraph": " For the obtaining of any state of affairs, x, to have extrinsic value there must be some other state of affairs, y, the obtaining of which has or would have intrinsic value. In order that the obtaining of any state of affairs, x, (1) have positive extrinsic value, there must be some other state of affairs, y, the obtaining of which has or would have posi\u00ad tive intrinsic value, and (2) have negative extrinsic value, there must be some other state of affairs, y, the obtaining of which has or would have negative intrinsic value. The phrase \"or would have\" is used in the pre\u00ad ceding two sentences because, as was suggested above, it is possible that --- ..._ the obtaining of a given state of affairs, x, have positive intrinsic value butnegative--exirinsic value because its obtaining prevents the obtai\u0402ing_ of some other state of affairs, y, the obt_aining _ _<?f._\u0403hic;h _ woul4_h_c!.Y.\u0404 . gi-eater .positi\u0405\u0406i\u0407t\u0408-i\u0409\u040ai-c\u00b7-\u040b;l\u040ce-\u00b7th\u040d\u040e--th\u00b7\u040f--obt:aining of \u0410- ha\u0411 . . \u00b7 Given the preceding terminology, we can now introduce the concept of the total value of the obtaining of a state of affairs. The total value of 36 The Nature of Value any state of affairs is determined by taking into account both its intrinsic and its extrinsic value. If the positive intrinsic value of one state of affairs, x, is the same as that of another, y, and if x has greater posi\u00ad tive extrinsic value than y has, then the total positive value of x is greater than that of y. Similarly, if the positive extrinsic value of x is the same as that of y, and if the positive intrinsic value of x is greater than that of y, then the total positive value of x is greater than that of y. It is therefore relatively easy to determine which of two states of affairs has greater total value if either the intrinsic or the extrinsic value of each is the same as that of the other. If each has the\u00b7same intrinsic and extrinsic value as the other, then the total value of each is the same as that of the other.",
