    "paragraph": " For example, Amy Kind (2001) sug- gests that we can assign mental imagery an essential role in imagin- ing without requiring that it distinguish one imagining from another. Likewise, we might assign mental imagery an essential role in imag- ining without requiring that every aspect of the imagining has to be \u201cread off\u201d from the image. How exactly we are to understand imagining, and how it is related to other speculative mental activities such as conceiving, also proves important for attempts to ascertain the epistemic value of these men- tal activities. As we have seen throughout this book, we frequently draw inferences about what\u2019s possible based on what we imagine or what we conceive. Is one of these mental activities better suited for this philosophical role than the other? In attempting to answer these questions, some philosophers interpret imagining as a special kind of conceiving (Chalmers 2002), while others differentiate the two activities. For example, Magdalena Balcerak Jackson (2016) sees both imagining and conceiving as forms of perspective-taking; but, while she sees imagining as a form of experiential perspective-taking, she sees conceiving as a form of rational perspective-taking. Before closing our discussion, it\u2019s worth noting that not everyone has the same kind of experience when calling a triangle to mind as the one that Descartes himself has. There seem to be vast indi- vidual differences among people with respect to their capacity for mental imagery. This kind of variation has been observed at least since the time of Francis Galton (1880), but recent studies have brought it prominently into the limelight (Zeman et al. 2015). Individuals with what\u2019s now referred to as aphantasia have a severely decreased capacity for mental imagery, with some such individuals reporting that they are Imagining Chiliagons 199 completely unable to produce mental imagery voluntarily.",

    "question": "How can we think of imagining without requiring it to distinguish one imagining from another?",
    "answer": "We can assign mental imagery an essential role in imagining without requiring that it distinguish one imagining from another. This approach suggests that mental imagery can play a crucial role in imagining, but it doesn't necessarily require that it be able to differentiate between different imaginings.",
