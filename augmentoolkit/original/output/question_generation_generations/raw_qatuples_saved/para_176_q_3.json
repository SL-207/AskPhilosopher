Those who favor the transmission view of testimony think that testimony is like this. If the person who tells you that p doesn\u2019t have knowledge or a justified belief that p, then they\u2019re passing you an empty bucket. You can\u2019t come to know or justifiedly believe that p on the basis of their testimony. EPISTEMOLOGICAL ISSUES: TESTIMONY; TRANSMISSION; NORMS OF ASSERTION Let\u2019s explore a challenge for the transmission view of testimony by considering the case of a particular schoolteacher: Mr. Flat. Not only is Mr. Flat a schoolteacher, he is also an active member of the Flat Earth Society (an actual group of people who believe that the earth is flat; here\u2019s their website: https://www.tfes.org/). Unfortunately (from his perspective), Mr. Flat has been tasked with teaching his class about the spherical shape of the Earth. And, even worse in his mind, he has been strictly forbidden from \u201cteaching the controversy\u201d on this issue. Mr. Flat is an especially diligent teacher, so he is well acquainted with the facts of the actual shape of the Earth\u2014its circumference, how if you were to travel in a straight line for long enough you would end up back where you started, and so on.

So, although it goes against his own beliefs, he tells his class the facts about the planet being spherical and never betrays that he has any doubts about this at all. As a result of Mr. Flat\u2019s testimony, his students come to believe the facts concerning Earth\u2019s shape. They have no clue that Mr. Flat is a flat earther and doesn\u2019t believe any of the facts that he has taught them.

    "question": "What is the relationship between Mr. Flat's beliefs and his role as a teacher?",
    "answer": "Despite his own doubts about the shape of the Earth, Mr. Flat takes his duty as a teacher very seriously and presents the facts about the planet being spherical without betraying his doubts. This suggests that, in his role as a teacher, Mr. Flat feels a responsibility to present accurate information to his students, regardless of his own personal beliefs.",
