    "paragraph": " Siegel\u2019s main argument for the Rich Content View, if sound, complicates that distinction. According to her argument, ex- pertise can influence what experience represents. If so, then if a dis- tinction between observation and theory can be drawn at all, it \u201cwill not align with the representation of low-level properties, on the one hand, and high-level properties on the other\u201d (Siegel 2021, sec. 4.3). Both proponents and opponents of the Rich Content View assume that perceptual experiences have representational contents, and that assumption is controversial. But, as Siegel observes, the Rich Content View and her argument for it could be framed without it. For exam- ple, according to one alternative view about perception, known as relationalism or na\u00efve realism, in veridical perception one\u2019s experience is partly constituted by a perceived object and its properties, rather than representations thereof (Campbell 2002, p. 116). But in that case the issue will simply be recast as concerning whether the relevant proper- ties include high-level properties.
