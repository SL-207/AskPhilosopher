    "paragraph": " Like Avicenna and Descartes, Leibniz rejected physicalism\u2014a view on which the mind is a physical phenomenon. He imagined a physical system (such as a brain, perhaps) enlarged to a size where we can walk inside it and observe its parts, just as we can walk into a grain mill and observe the rotation of the wheel and grindstones. According to Leibniz, such observations would not reveal the existence of mental phenomena such as \u201cperceptions.\u201d The other chapters in Part I also concern the debate between \u00addualism and physicalism, but they describe more recent ideas from 20th- and 21st-century philosophy. In those chapters, the focus is no longer on mind generally or on minds in the sense of subjects of expe- rience (that is, things that have experience). Instead, the focus narrows to conscious experience. Though there are many different varieties of consciousness (for example, awakeness and awareness), these chapters focus on an experiential variety of consciousness\u2014the variety of con- sciousness picked out when we talk about what it\u2019s like to undergo a particular experience at a particular time (see Chapters 4 and 5). For example, Chapter 3 focuses on the experience of pain. There is something it is like to feel pain, as anyone who has felt pain knows. How does conscious experience (in the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d sense) relate to the brain? Using reasoning reminiscent of Descartes\u2019 argument for mind\u2013body dualism, Brie Gertler argues that we can imagine a spe- cific pain experience being disembodied\u2014and that, when we do this, we grasp everything that is essential to that experience. She goes on to infer that physicalism is mistaken, at least when it comes to the nature of particular pain experiences. Her position is not substance dualism but rather property dualism: mental properties, such as the property of being painful, are distinct from physical properties, such as the sorts of properties discovered by neuroscience.",
