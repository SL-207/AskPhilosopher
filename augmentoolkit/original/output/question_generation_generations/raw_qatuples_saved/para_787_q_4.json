    "paragraph": " The rough idea here is that the process must be \u201cinferentially opaque\u201d (i.e. the person can- not introspectively access the process leading to the belief) and the process has to develop as a result of learning and innate constraints. Another way of fleshing out this sort of response is to argue that in addition to reliability, a process must be \u201cproperly functioning\u201d in order to yield justified beliefs (Bergmann 2006, Ghijsen 2016). The thinking here is that a belief-forming process must either be designed (e.g. by God) to produce true beliefs of a particular kind or it must be reliable because it has developed by way of natural selection to produce true beliefs of a particular kind in a particular environment. This response holds that Ms. Cleo\u2019s belief, though re- liable, is not justified because it results from a process that does not properly function in the relevant sense. Yet another response maintains that Ms. Cleo\u2019s belief, though reliable, isn\u2019t justified because it doesn\u2019t manifest her cognitive vir- tues (Breyer and Greco 2008). The idea here is that in order for a \u00adbelief-forming process to yield justified beliefs, that process has to be integrated with the person\u2019s character as a cognitive agent. Since Ms. Cleo is oblivious to her psychic powers and has no recollection of being accurate about this sort of thing, her clairvoyance faculty isn\u2019t sufficiently part of her character as a cognitive agent to deliver justified beliefs.

    "question": "Why is it that, according to some views, a belief-forming process must be \"inferentially opaque\"?",
    "answer": "A belief-forming process must be \"inferentially opaque\" because it means that the person cannot introspectively access the process leading to the belief. This is necessary to prevent the person from being overly confident or certain of their beliefs.",
