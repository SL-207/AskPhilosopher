DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-23 INVERTED QUALIA BACKGROUND Qualia are phenomenal properties: experiential, \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d fea- tures of consciousness, such as the distinctive way it feels to see red or feel pain. In inverted qualia cases, we consider the possibility of people whose color qualia are reversed. For example, when an invert sees red blood, her color experience feels to her like the color experience most of us have when we see green grass; and when she sees green grass, her color experience feels to her like the color experience most of us have when we see red blood. Such cases are discussed in philosophy today largely because they are thought to threaten important theories in the philosophy of mind. One such theory is functionalism, on which qualia are characterized in terms of functional properties: external stimuli, behavioral responses, and relations among mental states (see Chapter 16).",
