    "paragraph": " RESPONSES One response to this case attempts to save the sensitivity condition by arguing that this example fails to constitute a genuine counterexample (Adams and Clarke 2005). The thought here is that it is important to recognize that Martha is using the fact that what she sees looks like a red barn to form her belief that there is a red barn. This \u201cmethod\u201d is one that only applies when there is what looks to be a red barn present. Hence, if the red barn wasn\u2019t there and Martha were to believe that what she sees is a barn, it would be because she was using some other method. As a result, according to this response, when Martha believes there is a red barn, she believes there is a barn in part because she is using the \u201cred barn method\u201d. This method makes it so that Martha knows she is seeing something that is both red and a barn. While this response may save the sensitivity response from the problem of saying that Martha knows she sees a red barn but doesn\u2019t know that she sees a barn, we might worry that it makes the sensitivity response fail when it comes to fake barn cases (see A Strange County pp. 16\u201320). After all, it is plausible that Martha doesn\u2019t know that she\u2019s seeing a red barn in this case either, given all of the fake barns around her. Another response is to admit that cases like this one show that the letter of the sensitivity response is incorrect but insist that it is nev- ertheless correct in spirit. This is the approach of most contemporary defenders of sensitivity conditions on knowledge\u2014they modify the NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE 24 original sensitivity condition that we have been discussing in various ways in an attempt to avoid this and other problems (Black 2002, Roush 2005, Becker 2007, DeRose 2010, and Melchior 2019).
