    "paragraph": " This applies not only to value theory but also to any other area of inquiry. It is sometimes hard to know which terms require definition and which do not and which are definable and which are not. If the argument of this section is sound, in value theory a term that nei\u00ad ther needs to be nor can be defined is \"intrinsic goodness\". From this, however, it does not follow that we do not know what it means. 2. Proof and Knowledge of Intrinsic Value In the previous section it was argued that the concept of intrinsic good\u00ad ness is indefinable. A similar argument, with of course the necessary changes, could also be presented to establish that the concept of intrinsic badness is also indefinable. From the fact, however, that these concepts are indefinable it does not follow that we cannot prove or know that things of various kinds, again using \"thing\" in a wide sense, are intrinsically good or bad. We turn now to discuss briefly the ques\u00ad tion of whether such proof and knowledge are possible. As is well known, Moore maintained that there can be no proof of any claim to the effect that a given thing is or is not intrinsically good (or bad or indifferent). Since the classes of the intrinsically good, the intrinsically bad, and the intrinsically indifferent are conjointly exhaus\u00ad tive and mutually exclusive, anything conceivable is a member of one 68 The Nature of Value and only one of these classes. If however, Moore's claim is correct, the question of which things are members of which classes is not a question that can be answered by presenting proof. This is the case, according to Moore, because there are no propositions more evident than any true proposition to the effect that a given thing is intrinsically good ( or bad or indifferent) that could be used as premises in an argument that would establish the truth of such a proposition. There might be other proposi\u00ad tions, each of which is as evident as, but no more evident than, a given proposition p to the effect that a given thing is intrinsically good which are such that if they are true p also is true.",
