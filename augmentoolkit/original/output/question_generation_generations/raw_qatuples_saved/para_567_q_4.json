Intuitively, if the wood from which t was actually made instead constituted a wooden sphere or a large cylinder, those entities would not have been t. What about our- selves? Which properties of individual human beings are contingent, and which are necessary? 48 PERSONS, PERSONAL IDENTITY, AND THE SELF 296 THE CASE Consider Queen Elizabeth. Must she have been born of royal blood (Sprigge 1962, pp. 202\u20133)? Reflecting on this case, Saul Kripke (1972/1980) suggests that it seems doubtful that having royal blood was one of her necessary properties, for, if it were, then it would have to be necessary that at some point her family acquired royal power. And that her family acquired royal power is a contingent fact of \u00adhistory; her family might never have come to power. What about her biological origins? Are those necessary or contingent? Elizabeth orig- inated from a certain set of gametes (sperm and egg) g, that came from her actual biological parents\u2014the previous king and queen. Could she have existed if she had not originated from that particular pair of gametes? Could she have originated from a different set of gametes g*, which came instead from Harry and Bess Truman? Initially, that possibility might seem easy to imagine. For example, imagine reading a news headline: \u201cUnsealed secret records reveal that Queen Elizabeth was born to the Trumans and then adopted by the English king and queen!\u201d Such a revelation may be unlikely, but is it impossible? Surely not, it might seem. But that reasoning is dubious. Granted, we do not know with cer- tainty that the imaginary headline\u2019s claim isn\u2019t true. But that\u2019s irrele- vant. When we asked \u201cCould the Queen have existed without having originated from g?,\u201d we weren\u2019t asking a question about knowledge or certainty. Our question was rather this: Given that the Queen actually originated from g, is there a possible world\u2014a way history could have gone but didn\u2019t\u2014in which she existed but didn\u2019t originate from g?",

    "answer": "It seems doubtful that anything, no matter how small, could be compressed into a tiny lump that is smaller than a grain of sand. This is because even the smallest objects have a certain size and density that cannot be compressed beyond a certain point.",
