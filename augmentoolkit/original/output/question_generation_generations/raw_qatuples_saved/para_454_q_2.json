    "paragraph": " Recognition of this concern about the defeasibility of knowledge not being enough to block the problematic dogmatism leads other philosophers to argue that in order to solve this puzzle, we have to acknowledge that knowledge is defeasible and realize that even if we know that some evidence is misleading it doesn\u2019t always mean that we can reasonably ignore it. Various reasons have been offered for accept- ing the claim that knowing that some evidence is misleading isn\u2019t suf- ficient for reasonably ignoring the evidence. One reason is that while we might know that some evidence is misleading, we may not know that we know this. This approach claims that we need this additional knowledge about what we know in order to reasonably disregard ev- idence. A related reason that has been given is simply that we are too likely to be mistaken about whether some evidence is misleading or not (Veber 2004). As a result of our fallibility, when it comes to deter- mining whether evidence is misleading, we shouldn\u2019t ignore evidence. A final reason that some give is that misleading evidence concerning p might still be able to make it so that we should think that p is less likely to be true than we originally thought\u2014even when we know that the evidence is misleading (Ye 2016).
