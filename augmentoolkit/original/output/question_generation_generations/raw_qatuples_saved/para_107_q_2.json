    "paragraph": " JUSTIFICATION 156 Yet another response simply appeals to justified background beliefs to explain the difference between DeShawn\u2019s and John\u2019s justification (McCain and Moretti forthcoming). DeShawn has a number of justi- fied background beliefs that support trusting his seeming in this case, whereas John has justified background beliefs that serve as defeaters for his seeming. For instance, John plausibly has justified background beliefs such as that he is a novice and that he can\u2019t identify most birds by sight. Such justified background beliefs provide undercutting de- featers. Hence, the justification that John\u2019s seeming that the bird is a Red-Tailed Hawk would normally provide is defeated. One final sort of response is to insist that such cases pose a serious problem for phenomenal conservatism, and so maintain that phe- nomenal conservatism needs to be revised or that some other the- ory should be accepted instead. Some externalists accept a version of phenomenal conservatism where seemings provide justification, but only when those seemings reliably indicate the truth of their content (Bergmann 2013). Such an externalist version of phenomenal con- servatism could avoid this problem by claiming that only DeShawn\u2019s seeming is reliable, so only his seeming provides justification. Of course, an externalist might deny phenomenal conservatism alto- gether and claim that the difference here is simply that DeShawn\u2019s belief is formed by a reliable belief-forming process and John\u2019s isn\u2019t. Internalists might insist that for any seeming to provide justification, one must have justification for believing that that sort of seeming is reliable. Alternatively, internalists might opt for the sort of looks view discussed in the previous entry (see A Pair of Hens pp. 148\u2013152) rather than phenomenal conservatism (McGrath 2018). The idea being that rather than the seeming providing justification on its own, what jus- tifies DeShawn is that he has the seeming and that he knows what Red-Tailed Hawks look like, whereas John doesn\u2019t know what they look like.",
