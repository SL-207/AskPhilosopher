    "question": "What does Anscombe say about direction of fit, and why might her views not be enough to support the Humean view?",
    "answer": "Anscombe discusses direction of fit in her work, but I believe that her views on the subject are not likely to be sufficient to support the Humean view. According to Anscombe, direction of fit refers to the relationship between a person's beliefs and their actions. However, I think that Anscombe's observations on direction of fit are not enough to fully explain the Humean view, and that additional arguments are needed to support it.",
