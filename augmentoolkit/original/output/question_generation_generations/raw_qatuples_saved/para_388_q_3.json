    "paragraph": " If the argu\u00ad ment of that chapter does in fact establish this, then the concept of intrinsic goodness cannot be defined adequately in the way in which it is defined in definition (5). Even if, however, the preceding objections to definitions (2) through (5) could successfully be met, they, along with ( 1 ), would still suffer from a certain fatal flaw. This is that even if, in each of the five defini\u00ad tions, the sentences that result when some value is substituted for the variable \"x\" were such that the truth of\u00b7 the sentence expressing the definiendum both entails and is entailed by the sentence expressing the definiens, the sentence expressing the definiens would be true because the one expressing the definiendum is true, whereas the sentence expressing the definiendum would not be true because the one expressing the definiens is true. Although this applies to all five defini\u00ad tions, it will suffice if we consider only ( 1 ), given that the others are all unacceptable for the reasons given. Thus if the existence or occurrence of x is in itself preferable to its non-existence or non-occurrence, the reason is that x is intrinsically good; x, however, is not intrinsically good because its existence or occurrence is preferable in itself to its non\u00ad existence or non-occurrence. This can be put by saying that although x's being intrinsically good makes its existence or occurrence preferable in itself to its non-existence or non-occurrence, the preferability of its exis\u00ad tence or occurrence in itself to its non-existence or non-occurrence does not make it intrinsically good. Similar considerations, I believe, would apply to any otherwise acceptable definition of the concept of intrinsic goodness. What the preceding argument, if sound, establishes is that definitions of the concept of intrinsic goodness, whether they be in terms of non\u00ad evaluative or in terms of evaluative concepts, fail to capture or express the essence of such goodness.",
