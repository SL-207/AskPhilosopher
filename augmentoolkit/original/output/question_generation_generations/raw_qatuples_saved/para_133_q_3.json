    "paragraph": " Whether, however, they would so count, it still seems to be the case ( 1) that the exemplification of a given universal by a given particular can be good or bad, whereas the universal and the particular, taken singly in abstraction from the question of whether the former is exem\u00ad plified and of which universals the latter exemplifies, cannot be and (2) that the obtaining of a given state of affairs can be good or bad, whereas the state of affairs itself and its obtaining, taking each singly in abstrac\u00ad tion from the other, cannot be. If the preceding is correct, a world consisting only of universals and relationships between them and containing no particulars whatever would be a world devoid of value. This would be the case even if good\u00ad ness and various of its specific forms, such as moral goodness, beauty, and rationality, and badness and various of its specific forms, such as moral badness, ugliness, and irrationality, were themselves universals. This is to say that goodness and badness and their various specific forms, taken as universals, are not self-predicable-that, taken as uni\u00ad versals, goodness is not itself good, beauty is not itself beautiful, and rationality is not itself rational and that, again taken as universals, bad\u00ad ness is not itself bad, ugliness is not itself ugly, and irrationality is not itself irrational. It is only particulars, not universals, that can be good or bad in various ways even though their goodness or badness be deter\u00ad mined, at least in part, by the nature of the universals they exemplify. From the fact, however, that neither universals, taken in abstraction from their exemplification by particulars, nor states of affairs, taken in abstraction from any consideration of whether they obtain, can be good or bad, it does not follow that it is always inappropriate to speak of them as being good or bad. We sometimes do say that honesty, beauty, and rationality are good and dishonesty, ugliness, and irrationality bad and that a person's being honest, beautiful, or rational is good and that a person's being dishonest, ugly, or irrational is bad.",

    "question": "When do you think it is appropriate to speak of universals or states of affairs as being good or bad?",
    "answer": "I think it is sometimes appropriate to speak of universals or states of affairs as being good or bad, even if they cannot be good or bad in and of themselves. This can happen when we are considering how they are exemplified or obtained, or when we are evaluating their consequences or effects.",
