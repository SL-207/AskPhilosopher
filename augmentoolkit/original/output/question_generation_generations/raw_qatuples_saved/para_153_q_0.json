DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-43 BLINDSIGHT, DISTRACTED DRIVING, AND PNEUMATIC DRILLS BACKGROUND We all think we know what it is to be conscious. It\u2019s the difference between being awake and aware and being in a coma or a dreamless sleep. It\u2019s arguably not so simple, however. Studies of patients with damage to their visual cortex, as well as reflections on more mundane cases, suggest that consciousness might be a \u201cmongrel concept\u201d in- volving distinct functions and properties (Block 1995; see Chapter 4). THE CASES Patients with damage to their visual cortex often have \u201cblindspots\u201d in their visual fields, where they report seeing nothing at all. There\u2019s an odd twist, though. When forced to \u201cguess\u201d about features of objects in their blindspot, they are surprisingly accurate. So, for example, if an experimenter moves an object (perhaps a cursor on a screen) across the blindspot, the patient says they see nothing. If, however, they are asked to guess whether it is moving to the right or to the left, they 38 Blindsight, Distracted Driving, and Pneumatic Drills 231 can do so quite reliably. Paradoxically, they seem to be able to perceive something even though they are not aware of perceiving it. This phe- nomenon is dubbed blindsight (Weiskrantz 2009). What is going on in cases of blindsight? Although there are a num- ber of relatively early philosophical discussions of the import of blind- sight (Van Gulick 1989 and Searle 1992, for example), Ned Block\u2019s (1995) discussions are probably the most influential. For Block, blind- sight suggests that two distinct sorts of consciousness can come apart. He argues for a distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness. A phenomenally conscious state is in the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like sense\u201d (see Chapters 4\u20136).",
