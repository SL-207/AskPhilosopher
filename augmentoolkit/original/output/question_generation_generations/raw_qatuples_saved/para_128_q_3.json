    "paragraph": " 135\u20136). His moral concerned humility: some \u201ctough-minded slugs\u201d \u00adincorrectly thought their science, or mere extensions thereof, could explain all of nature. The discussion of Jackson\u2019s slugs appears at the end of the 1982 article where he first presents the knowledge argument. By \u00adcontrast, Stoljar (2006) takes his own slug example to undermine \u00adJackson\u2019s knowledge argument. Stoljar\u2019s moral is that the knowledge and conceivability arguments owe their apparent force to ignorance\u2014 ignorance of physical facts that are, at least currently, unknown (see Chapter 10; for similar responses, see Nagel 1974, McGinn 1989, van Gulick 1993, Polger 2004, Churchland 1996). Stoljar argues in detail that our situation parallels that of the slugs and the tiles. He invokes historical precedents: situations where argu- ments similar to the knowledge and conceivability arguments turned out to derive from ignorance. For example, in 1925 C. D. Broad pre- sented an argument similar to the knowledge argument to show that there are irreducible truths about chemical bonding\u2014an argument that can no longer be sustained in light of the quantum-mechanical theory of chemical bonding (which was not widely known in 1925). In response, proponents of the knowledge and conceivability ar- guments sometimes point to disanalogies between those arguments and the historical precedents Stoljar cites (Alter 2023). Broad\u2019s argu- ment concerns whether certain truths about chemical bonding can CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 64 be deduced from truths about more fundamental physical properties. Plausibly, all truths concerned\u2014including both the chemical truths and the more fundamental physical truths\u2014are structural: they are all truths about spatiotemporal causal structure. They are the sorts of truth that can be fully expressed in an abstract, mathematical \u00adlanguage. By contrast, the knowledge argument concerns whether certain \u00adphenomenal truths (truths about consciousness) can be deduced from structural physical truths.",

    "question": "What is the key difference between Broad's argument and the knowledge and conceivability arguments, according to proponents of those arguments?",
    "answer": "Proponents of the knowledge and conceivability arguments argue that there are disanalogies between those arguments and the historical precedent of Broad's argument. Specifically, they claim that Broad's argument concerns structural truths (about chemical bonding and physical properties) that can be fully expressed in an abstract, mathematical language, whereas the knowledge argument concerns phenomenal truths (about consciousness) that may not be fully expressible in such a language.",
