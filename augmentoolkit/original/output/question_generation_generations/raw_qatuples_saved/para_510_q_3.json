    "paragraph": " Such an objec\u00ad tion might be based on either or both of two considerations. One is that the widow is not herself indifferent toward the bauble, the other that she likes it more than the necklace because it, not the necklace, was given her by her husband. Neither of these considerations, however, suffices to show that the bauble is not in fact indifferent. First, the fact that the widow is not indifferent toward it but rather likes it does not mean that it is not indifferent, since one can like or dislike a thing even though the thing itself, taken completely in abstraction from one's liking or disliking of it, in fact be indifferent. Second, even though she likes the bauble only because it was given her by her husband, it is still the bauble itself that she likes. Its having been given her by her husband is the cause of her liking it or the reason she likes it, and even though she would not like it had it not been given her by him, it is still it that she likes. Even though she might also like his having given it to her, perhaps because she takes his having done so as a little early sign of his love for her, such a liking would be a different liking in addition to her liking of it. Nor does the fact that she likes it only as a token of his love mean that it is not it that she likes, any more than the fact that she also likes the necklace as an aesthetic object means that it is not the necklace itself that she likes. Although many, perhaps most, of the things we like are liked as being instances of some kind, it is still the things themselves that we like even though we like them only as instances of certain kinds. Even though the widow likes the necklace only as an aesthetic object and the bauble only as a token of her husband's love, it is still the neck\u00ad lace and the bauble that she likes. Not everything we like, however, seems to be liked only as being an instance of some kind.",

    "question": "How does the fact that the widow likes the bauble only because it was given to her by her husband affect your opinion on whether she likes the bauble itself?",
    "answer": "Even though she likes the bauble only because it was given to her by her husband, it is still the bauble itself that she likes. Its having been given to her by her husband is the cause of her liking it, but it is still the bauble that she likes.",
