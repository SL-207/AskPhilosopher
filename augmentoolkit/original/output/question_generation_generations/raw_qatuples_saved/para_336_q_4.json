    "paragraph": " Her solution begins with a constraint on physicalism that Jessica Wilson (2006) calls the No Fundamental Mentality constraint: physicalism is true only if there is no fundamental mentality (see Chapter 21). That con- straint is widely accepted. Montero proposes a sort of generalization 22 Brains within Brains 129 of it, which could be called the No Low-Level Mentality constraint: \u00adphysicalism is true only if there is neither fundamental mentality nor an infinite descent of mentality (Montero 2006; cf. Brown and \u00adLadyman 2009, Schaffer 2017). Initially, the No Low-Level Mentality constraint might seem to be just what is called for. Suppose everything physical is infinitely decomposable: quarks are composed of more elementary phenomena, which in turn are composed of yet more elementary phenomena, and so on forever. Physicalism could still be true if the chain of de- composition includes only physical phenomena. What would seem incompatible with physicalism would be if, below a certain point in that chain of decomposition, the more basic phenomena are men- tal. In that case, the world would be grounded in (that is, based on) mental phenomena. But that sort of scenario is exactly what the No \u00adLow-Level Mentality constraint specifies is incompatible with \u00adphysical. Problem solved! Or so it might seem. Christopher Devlin Brown describes what appears to be a counterexample to the No Low-Level Mentality re- quirement: a scenario in which physicalism could be true even though there is an infinite descent of mentality. To construct his counterexam- ple, Brown appeals to a \u201ccompositional account of mentality\u201d that, he suggests, all versions of physicalism entail. On this account, if a \u00adphysical system has mental properties, then it has those \u00adproperties solely in vir- tue of the arrangement of its constituent parts. For \u00adexample, he writes: If a mental type is identical to a neural type, then just get the chemical and other constituents of nerves together in the right way, set them acting cor- rectly and\u2014voil\u00e0!",

    "question": "What is a compositional account of mentality, and what does it imply about the relationship between physical systems and mental properties?",
    "answer": "A compositional account of mentality suggests that, if a physical system has mental properties, then it has those properties solely in virtue of the arrangement of its constituent parts. This implies that mental properties are not inherent properties of physical systems, but rather emerge from the arrangement of their constituent parts.",
