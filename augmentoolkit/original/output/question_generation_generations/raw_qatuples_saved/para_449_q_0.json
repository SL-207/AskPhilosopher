    "paragraph": " If this be so, then a happy person can be a good person and a happy life a good life only to the degree to which the person in question, who is any person, does not like bad and dislike good things and who acts accordingly. Given, however, that two per\u00ad sons and their lives are otherwise equally good but one is happier, the happier life but not the happier person is better than the other. This means that a distinction must be drawn between a person and his life. Although being happier makes one of two otherwise equally good lives better than the other, it does not make one of two equally good persons better than the other. If the preceding is correct, then although the person who likes all the things of which he has experience or knowledge, regardless of whether they be good, bad, or indifferent, might be likelier to be happier and to have a happier life than the person who likes only good and indifferent 1 80 The Nature of Value things, he has his happier life only at the cost of being a worse person and leading a worse life than the other person. This is the case even though liking all the indifferent things of which one has experience or knowledge is not itself good, since even if such liking is not good it still would not seem to be bad, as is the liking of bad things. But even if liking all indifferent things is not intrinsically good, it still would be ex\u00ad trinsically good if it led to greater happiness than would liking only good things and had no other consequences the negative value of which would be greater than the positive.value of the increased happi\u00ad ness to which it leads. Given that such liking would be likely to be ex\u00ad trinsically good in the way indicated, endeavoring to develop it would also seem to be extrinsically good. If so, then the fourth possible ex\u00ad treme answer to our question is perhaps not as implausible as it might initially appear to be.",
