    "paragraph": " Believing that one of the courses of action, if chosen, would have greater value than any of the others, I choose it. Whether it does in fact have the value I believed prior to choice it would have might well be determinable only after the choice has been made and its consequences have unfolded. And whether it does in fact have greater value than some other possible course of action would have had had it been chosen might well be something we can never know. We also value and evaluate states of affairs that never obtain but that could have obtained only in the past, i.e., only prior to our valuing and evaluating them. Thus we might believe that the state of affairs con\u00ad sisting of Germany's not invading Poland in 1939 would have had greater value had it obtained than did the opposite state of affairs. The state of affairs consisting of Germany's not invading Poland in 1939, since it did not and can never obtain, is only an intentional object, as is also its obtaining. Nonetheless, we might, while knowing that it did not obtain, still regard its obtaining as preferable to the obtaining of the opposite state of affairs that did in fact obtain. This clearly would seem to be a case in which we would be regarding an intentional object, i.e., a state of affairs that did not and never can obtain, as being preferable to a state of affairs that did in fact obtain and that therefore, although an intentional object, is not only an intentional object. We can also regard as good the obtaining of some state of affairs we believe has obtained or is obtaining but that in fact has not and is not obtaining. In such a case we regard as good something we believe not to be merely an intentional object but yet in fact is only such an object and nothing more. If so, then we can value and evaluate things that in fact are only intentional objects, regardless of whether we believe or know that they are only such objects.",
