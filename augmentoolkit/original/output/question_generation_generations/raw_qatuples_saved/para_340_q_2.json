    "paragraph": " There is no difficulty in under\u00ad standing the concept of neutral value, given that to say of a given thing that it is neutral in value is to say that it is neither good nor bad. The problem lies in understanding the latter two concepts. Unless they are understood the concept of value cannot be understood. Moreover, as the considerations presented in chapter 3 indicate, the concept of extrinsic value cannot be understood unless the concept of intrinsic value is understood. If the preceding is correct, the concepts of value, of positive, negative, and neutral value, of intrinsic and extrinsic value, and of instrumental and contributory goodness and badness cannot be understood unless the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness are understood. The latter two concepts are therefore the central concepts of value theory. Attempts to define these two concepts fall into two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive classes. One class consists of attempts to define them in terms of non-evaluative concepts, the other of attempts to define them in terms of evaluative concepts other than the concepts of intrinsic goodness and badness. Definitions of the first type were termed by Moore naturalistic defin\u00ad itions, and many value theorists and moral philosophers have followed Moore in using this terminology. Such language, however, is unfortu\u00ad nate. Moore distinguishes between naturalistic and metaphysical ethics and claims that both commit what he calls the naturalistic fallacy, which, according to one of the several accounts of the fallacy he prese\u0452ts, consists in defining the concept of good in terms of what he calls natural properties. Yet despite the fact that he regards metaphys\u00ad ical ethics as committing the naturalistic fallacy, he distinguishes this Definition, Proof, and Knowledge of Intrinsic Value 61 type of ethics from naturalistic ethics by saying that it defines the con\u00ad cept of good in terms of non-natur\u0413l supersensible properties.",
