    "paragraph": " She is now acquainted with redness. Perhaps the most prominent physicalist response to this scenario though is to allow that Mary does in fact gain new propositional knowledge when she sees the red apple for the first time. Neverthe- less, this response contends that Mary\u2019s gaining this new knowledge isn\u2019t a problem for physicalism because although Mary comes to have new knowledge, it isn\u2019t knowledge of a new fact (Horgan 1984, Tye 1995). The thought is that Mary comes to possess a new phenome- nal concept when she sees the apple\u2014she now has the phenomenal concept of \u201cred\u201d. Her possession of this new concept allows her to form new beliefs and know things using that concept. However, the response insists that the things she comes to know aren\u2019t new facts about color or color vision. Rather, the idea is that Mary is learning the same facts in a new way now that she sees red. RECOMMENDED READING GENERAL OVERVIEWS Qualia: The Knowledge Argument, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

    "question": "What is the implication of the physicalist response for the Knowledge Argument against Physicalism?",
    "answer": "The physicalist response implies that the Knowledge Argument against Physicalism is not as strong as it initially seems. According to this response, even if Mary gains new knowledge, it doesn't necessarily pose a problem for physicalism, as the new knowledge isn't knowledge of a new fact.",
