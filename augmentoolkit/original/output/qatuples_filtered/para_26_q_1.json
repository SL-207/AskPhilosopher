    "paragraph": " How should that be explained? According to Siegel, the answer is provided by the Rich Content View. Before you learned how to recognize pine trees by sight, the property of being a pine tree was not part of the representational content of your visual experience of seeing a pine tree. But that property is part of that content now that you\u2019re an expert pine-tree spotter. That, Siegel argues, is what explains the perceptual change. Likewise, the change in how Cyrillic looks to you now, as compared to when you couldn\u2019t read it, is explained by which properties your visual experiences represent. After, but not be- fore, you learned how to read Russian, your experiences represented semantic properties of the Cyrillic symbols (semantic properties are properties concerning meaning). In both cases, there is a striking ex- periential shift, which Siegel calls a phenomenal contrast. That, in brief, is Siegel\u2019s argument for the Rich Content View: we should believe it because it explains the phenomenal contrasts. PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 214 The examples of the pine trees and the Cyrillic text are not exotic or unusual. The sort of perceptual change they illustrate is common. Charles Siewert (1998, ch. 7) provides several other examples, such as the fact that a person might look different to you after you\u2019ve gotten to know them, and the fact that your neighborhood might look dif- ferent to you after you\u2019ve lived there for a while. Also, the focus on cases involving vision is not essential. For example, there is a marked difference in what it\u2019s like to hear a foreign language before and after learning it (Block 1995, p. 234). According to Siegel, the Rich Con- tent View explains such facts about perception. DISCUSSION Can the phenomenal-contrast cases Siegel discusses be explained without appeal to the Rich Content View? There have been attempts to provide alternative explanations.",
