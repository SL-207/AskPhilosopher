    "paragraph": " A twist on this strategy holds that there is more than one dimension of content, and so, in effect, Pierre\u2019s belief can\u2019t be fully captured by a single proposition. Pierre does believe two incompatible proposi- tions: London is pretty and London is not pretty. There is, however, another layer of content that captures the significance of the belief for Pierre, just as it was suggested above. This is ultimately a version of the Fregean strategy in that it provides a level of content that includes something like a term\u2019s sense and another that includes its referent. Which of the two dimensions of content we employ when we ascribe beliefs\u2014that is, when we say such things as \u201cPierre believes London is pretty,\u201d or \u201cPierre believes London is not pretty,\u201d or \u201cPierre believes London is pretty and he believes that it\u2019s not pretty\u201d\u2014will depend in part on context. If we want to highlight the city he is thinking about, we will be inclined to ascribe the referential content; but when we want to highlight the way in which he is thinking about these cities, we will ascribe the content more closely aligned with a \u201csense\u201d (Stal- naker 1987, Crimmins and Perry 1989, Chalmers 2002).

    "question": "What is a twist on the strategy for capturing the complexity of Pierre's belief about London's appearance?",
    "answer": "This strategy acknowledges that there is more than one dimension of content and that Pierre's belief cannot be fully captured by a single proposition. Specifically, Pierre believes two incompatible propositions: London is pretty and London is not pretty.",
