Leibniz found materialism, with what he took to be its mechanistic underpinnings, inadequate to explain perception and thought. Some of his reasons had to do with his other philosophical commitments. But the thought experiment of the mill appears to be an attempt to independently motivate the rejection of materialism. Leibniz\u2019s argument can be seen as a precur- sor to more contemporary arguments that structure and dynamics \u00adcannot explain phenomenal consciousness (see Chapter 4), as well as to Searle\u2019s Chinese Room argument (see Chapter 18). THE CASE According to the materialist, the mind is ultimately a physical ma- chine. Thinking, perception, and consciousness are just results of the machine\u2019s operation. Imagine such a machine\u2014perhaps the brain\u2014 being enlarged to the point that we could walk inside it and see the movements of the parts, just as we can walk into a mill and see the CONSCIOUSNESS AND DUALISM 10 rotations of the wheel and grindstones. Although we can easily see how these movements produce other movements or generate physi- cal activity, nothing about the workings of a machine would suggest the existence of thoughts or perceptions. No matter how much we analyze the movements of the mill\u2019s inner parts, and no matter how much we understand about the physics of the situation, there would be no reason to think there were things like thoughts or perceptions. Their existence would seem to be something beyond what we can conclude from our understanding of the material workings of the mill.",
