    "paragraph": " That seems possible, despite the fact that Invert\u2019s qualia are inverted. But then color qualia can vary independently of the physical properties with which they are supposed to be identical. So, it is hard to see how color qualia could be physical properties. Parallel reasoning has also been used to challenge representation- alism. On representationalism, phenomenal properties are identified with (or at least supervene on) representational properties\u2014properties of representing the world (Harman 1990, Chalmers 2004). Further, on significant versions of this view, representational properties are them- selves characterized in functional, causal, and historical terms (Dretske 1995, Lycan 1996, Tye 2000). For example, on this view, phenomenal redness is the property of representing redness. Also on this view, what it is to represent redness is fully determined by such things as the fact that certain sorts of visual experiences (described in objective, scientific terms) are typically caused by interacting with red objects. In other words, there is \u201ccausal co-variation\u201d between phenomenally red experiences and interaction with red objects. However, it seems possible that Invert is just like Non-vert with respect to all relevant representational properties, including such things as causal history. If such a thing is possible, then it is hard to see how color qualia could be such representational properties. PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 118 DISCUSSION Inverted qualia cases raise a number of contested issues. One is whether such cases can actually happen. Martine Nida-R\u00fcmelin (1996) argues that there is scientific evidence that they do happen, though the cases she has in mind are ones in which the inverts are both functionally and physically atypical. There are three types of retinal photoreceptor that play a central role in human color vision, known as B-cones, G-cones, and R-cones.",

    "question": "Can Invert and Non-vert have the same color qualia if they have the same representational properties?",
    "answer": "Yes, if Invert and Non-vert have the same representational properties, including causal history, it is possible that they have the same color qualia.",
