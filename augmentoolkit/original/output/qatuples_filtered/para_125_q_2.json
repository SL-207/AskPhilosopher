    "paragraph": " Characterizing the externalism of philosophers such as Hilary Putnam (1975) and Tyler Burge (1979, 1982) as \u201cpassive,\u201d Andy Clark and David Chalmers (1998) put forth a more \u201cactive\u201d externalist view on which the relevant worldly fea- tures come into play by driving\u2014and even constituting\u2014cognitive states and processes. The thought experiment discussed in this chap- ter aims to show that it is not just that mental content is constitu- tively determined by features of the external world: cognition itself sometimes resides in the external world. In other words, cognitive states \u00adthemselves, such as memory states, can include external entities. 26 CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 162 This\u00a0claim is often referred to as the extended mind thesis. In recent years, the extended mind thesis has become associated with a larger research program known as 4E Cognition\u2014where the four E\u2019s stand for embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended. THE CASE Consider Inga, a resident of New York City. After hearing about a new exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), she is intrigued and decides to go see it. Having been to the Museum before, she pauses for a moment until she recalls that it is located on 53rd Street. She then heads in that direction. Now, consider Otto, another resident of New York City. Otto is in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and he has developed various techniques to help him in his daily life. One such technique involves the use of a notebook where he writes down important informa- tion. He carries the notebook with him wherever he goes, is diligent about recording any new information in it, and consults it regularly throughout the day to look up information that he has already re- corded in it. Like Inga, Otto is intrigued when he hears about the new exhibit at MoMA and decides to go see it. He pauses for a moment to consult his notebook, sees that the Museum is on 53rd Street, and therefore heads in that direction.",

    "question": "Can you give an example of a situation where a person's cognitive processes are extended into the external world, such as a notebook or a map?",
    "answer": "Yes, an example of this would be a situation where a person with Alzheimer's disease, such as Otto, uses a notebook to record important information and consult it regularly throughout the day in order to help with their memory and decision-making.",
