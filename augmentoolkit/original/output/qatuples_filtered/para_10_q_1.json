    "paragraph": " Fodor\u2019s answer is that there cannot be disjunctive kinds. But why not? Kim offers an example to help us see what might be problem- atic about disjunctive kinds. Jade, it turns out, is not a single mineral. Instances of jade are either instances of the mineral nephrite or the mineral jadeite. It is, in fact, a disjunctive kind. Can we treat that as just a kind like any other? The problem is that there is no guarantee of any causal similarity between jadeite and nephrite. They could be\u2014and in fact are\u2014very different physically. This means that, as a kind, jade cannot be used to confirm interesting generalizations. Suppose one found 1000 pieces of jade and discovered they were all green. Suppose further that all the pieces of jade one found were jadeite. Kim claims this would not support the generalization that all jade was green. You PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 80 would have found some confirmation that all jadeite is green; but, because of the disunified nature of jade as a kind, you can\u2019t conclude anything about other instances of jade from your evidence\u2014they might be nephrite and you don\u2019t know anything about nephrite! In particular, you don\u2019t know that all\u2014or indeed any\u2014nephrite is green. What makes something apt for inclusion in scientific laws\u2014i.e., what makes it a natural kind\u2014is that it has enough unity as a kind for ob- servations about one instance to bear on observations on all instances of the kind. So, the reason we should reject disjunctive kinds like jade is that they lack such unity. At this point, Kim seems only to have given Fodor a premise for his own argument\u2014since disjunctions can\u2019t be kinds and can\u2019t enter into laws, there can be no disjunctive physical law corresponding to the special science laws. But, says Kim, there is a problem. Jade is dis- junctive whether you call it \u201cjade\u201d or whether you call it \u201cjadeite or nephrite.\u201d So why aren\u2019t economic kinds disjunctive, whether you call them \u201cdollar\u201d or \u201cP1 or P2\u201d?",

    "question": "What is the problem with treating jade as a disjunctive kind for the purposes of scientific laws?",
    "answer": "The problem is that because jade is a disjunctive kind, consisting of two different minerals (nephrite and jadeite), there is no unity to the kind. As a result, observations about one instance of jade (e.g. that it is green) do not provide any information about other instances of jade, because they may be made of a different mineral (nephrite).",
