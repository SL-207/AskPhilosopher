    "paragraph": " That role might happen to be played by brain states; but things made of different stuff (robots perhaps) can have beliefs too because other materials (silicon chips and circuits, perhaps) play the belief role. So, even though in humans belief roles are played by physical states and processes, being a belief is not iden- tical with some type of physical state or process. The non-reductive physicalist faces the exclusion problem no less than the dualist: as long as mental properties are distinct from a set of properties that can do all the causal work, they would seem to be epiphenomenal with respect to the physical world, lacking physical efficacy of their own. DISCUSSION Although the exclusion problem applies to both dualism and non-\u00ad reductive physicalism, these different camps tend to offer different responses to the problem. The non-reductive physicalist, but not the dualist, can take advantage of the fact that mental properties bear very The Exclusion Problem 73 close relations to physical properties. Mental properties are, for ex- ample, realized or constituted by physical properties. To return to the functionalist example we considered earlier, brain states that play the belief role are said to be the physical \u201crealizers\u201d for the belief, or might be said to \u201cconstitute\u201d the belief. So, for the non-reductive physicalist, although being a pain is distinct from a particular physical kind\u2014such the firing of a particular group of neurons\u2014it doesn\u2019t exist inde- pendently of the physical. As a rough analogy, being a queen in chess isn\u2019t identical with a physical type either: I can have a plastic queen shaped like Marge Simpson and you can have a marble queen shaped like Daenerys Targaryen; but what makes these things queens in chess aren\u2019t those physical characteristics. Nevertheless, a movement of those pieces isn\u2019t independent of the physical movement of the shaped plastic or marble.",

    "question": "Can non-reductive physicalism and dualism both be subject to the exclusion problem?",
    "answer": "Yes, both non-reductive physicalism and dualism can be subject to the exclusion problem. This problem arises when mental properties seem to be epiphenomenal with respect to the physical world, lacking physical efficacy of their own, unless they are identical with physical properties.",
