    "paragraph": " Here the burden is to explain why we might naturally have the intuition in a way that is consistent with the intuitive judgment being false. Karen Neander (1991) tries to meet that burden by arguing that, even if our intuitions about real cases have some measure of reliability, the Swampman case is hypothetical and unrealistic. Neander (1996) and others, includ- ing Millikan (1996), also argue that our intuitions about Swampman might be no more trustworthy than analogous intuitions that have been proven false. For example, consider the proposition that there could be water without H2O. It is widely accepted that there is no such possibility. Water could not exist without H2O because water is H2O (Kripke 1972, Putnam 1975). There could be a substance with all the superficial features of water\u2014something that is indistinguish- able from water if one does not examine it with a microscope, say. CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 150 But that would not be water. Similarly, Neander, Millikan, and others argue, although Swampman could exist, he would not have mental states with representational content. That is because what it is to have such states is (partly) to have states with a history of co-varying with certain environmental factors, features that his states lack. In other words, we should not expect intuition to reveal the true nature of rep- resentational content any more than intuition reveals the true nature of water. Swampman himself would probably be surprised to discover that his words don\u2019t refer to anything. But, according to Neander, Millikan, and others, that is true nonetheless. Lastly, some argue that, on reflection, the possibility of \u00adSwampman existing with representational mentality is compatible with the teleo- logical theories in question. For example, some argue that the relevant theories concern only actual cases, and so merely hypothetical cases are irrelevant (Papineau 2001).",
