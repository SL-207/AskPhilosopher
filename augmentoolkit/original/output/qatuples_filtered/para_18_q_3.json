    "paragraph": " Beliefs and desires are characterized by these differences in direction of fit. Other states seem to differ in this way as well. Perceptions aim to fit the world, but intentions aim to make the world fit them. DISCUSSION Though there is clearly something suggestive about Anscombe\u2019s ex- ample and the resulting notion of directions of fit, it has proved to be a little difficult to spell out. One famous interpretation and applica- tion of direction of fit comes from Michael Smith (1994), who uses it to provide a functionalist account of beliefs and desires. On Smith\u2019s model, somewhat roughly: a belief is that p is a state that tends to go out of existence when there is a perception that not-p, while a desire is that p is a state that endures despite that perception, and leads the subject to try to bring it about that p (see also Velleman 2000, p. 115.). This is a descriptive account of what makes beliefs and desires the states that they are. But there are a number of worries about this ac- count, not least that beliefs don\u2019t always go out of existence in the face of disagreeing perceptions. Some beliefs are stubborn. For example, a mother might believe her son is innocent despite mountains of evi- dence that he is not. And some perceptions are properly disregarded. CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 180 For example, the (illusory) perception that the stick in water is bent has no effect on my belief to the contrary (Sobel and Copp 2001, Frost 2014). A natural suggestion here is that the direction of fit contrast is not meant to capture how beliefs and desires as a matter a fact behave, but how they should behave. Anscombe\u2019s presentation of the case suggests that she might have something normative like this in mind. Crudely, one might say a subject\u2019s beliefs should represent the world\u2014a sub- ject should believe p only if it is true. And desires make normative demands on how the subject should interact with the world\u2014if S desires that p, S should try to bring it about that p.",

    "question": "What is the normative demand that a desire places on the subject's behavior?",
    "answer": "If S desires that p, then S should try to bring it about that p. This means that a desire is a state that motivates the subject to take action to achieve its goal.",
