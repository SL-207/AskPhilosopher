    "question": "What is the causal exclusion problem in the context of the metaphysics of mind?",
    "answer": "The causal exclusion problem is a challenge to physicalism, which holds that the physical world is the only reality. The problem arises because it seems that mental events, such as thoughts and desires, can cause physical events, which would exclude physical events from being caused by physical events alone. This creates a paradox that physicalists need to address.",
