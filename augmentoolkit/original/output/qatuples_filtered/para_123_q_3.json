    "paragraph": " Thus, unless we are prepared to admit that we might be wrong about whether we have qualitative states, we should accept that the Blockhead too has qualitative states. A third possible objection owes to the work of Hilary Putnam (1967; see also Tononi 2012). Consider a swarm of bees. Though each individual bee in the swarm might be conscious, Putnam notes that we tend not to think of the swarm as a whole as conscious. According to Putnam, we\u2019re intuitively committed to an anti-nesting principle: No conscious being can be broken down into decomposable parts that are themselves conscious. Because this principle is violated in the Block- head case\u2014since each mini-individual is itself conscious\u2014the case is not really conceivable. In response, Block has suggested that the anti-nesting principle has unintuitive consequences. Suppose that sci- entists were to develop tiny chips that could serve as replacements or enhancements for neurons, and suppose that the tiny chips themselves had low levels of consciousness. If we commit to the anti-\u00adnesting principle, then we would have to accept that a person who opts to have one of these tiny chips inserted into their brain is rendered \u00adunconscious as a result. Because the person now has a part that is con- scious, they cannot themselves be conscious. That seems implausible. PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 96 That said, it\u2019s worth noting that accepting that minds can nest leads to results that strike many as implausible. Eric Schwitzgebel (2015) has leveraged the claim that minds can nest to conclude that the \u00adentirety of the United States might reasonably be thought of as conscious (or at least, that this is what a materialist should think). To make his \u00adargument, he relies on two different thought \u00adexperiments. The first involves a supersquid whose neural system is spatially dis- tributed throughout its body, including among its limbs.",

    "answer": "Accepting that minds can nest implies that large systems, such as the United States, might reasonably be thought of as conscious, or at least that this is what a materialist should think.",
