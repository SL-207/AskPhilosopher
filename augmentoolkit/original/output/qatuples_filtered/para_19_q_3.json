    "paragraph": " But what about high-level properties, such as being a table or being a horse? Are those ever represented in visual perception? Some think the answer is no: the categories of being a table and being a horse are not part of your visual perceptual content, which is limited to represent- ing low-level properties such as color and shape (e.g., Dretske 1995, Tye 1995, Clark 2000). According to this view, high-level categories are introduced only after perceptual processing is completed, by a different part of your cognitive system. Susanna Siegel (2006, 2010) 35 Pine Trees and Cyrillic Text 213 disagrees. According to what she calls the Rich Content View, high-level properties can, and often do, figure into perceptual content. Siegel\u2019s main argument for that view appeals to examples of perception, in- cluding one involving pine trees and one involving Cyrillic text. THE CASES First example: you\u2019ve been hired to cut down all the pine trees in a grove that contains many different sorts of trees. You don\u2019t know what pine trees look like. Fortunately for you (though not for the pines), someone points out which trees are pines, and your ability to recog- nize pine trees improves over the following weeks. Eventually, you can spot them almost immediately. Second example: you look at a page filled with Cyrillic text, but you can\u2019t read Russian. To you, what\u2019s on the page are just meaningless squiggles and squoggles. Then you go about learning to read Russian, and eventually you succeed. The same page, with the Cyrillic text unaltered, looks notably different to you than it used to. When you started to learn, you had to attend to each letter separately, but now it actually takes effort to do that. You perceive the symbols as meaningful words and sentences. Both examples involve a sort of experiential shift: a marked change in what it\u2019s like for you to perceive the same thing (a pine tree or some Cyrillic writing).",
