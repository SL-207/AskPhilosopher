    "paragraph": " It\u2019s not just beliefs that have intentionality. My desire to see tonight\u2019s An- gels game and my hope that Trout wins the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award also have aboutness. Do all of our mental states have intentional content? Representationalists answer this question in the affirmative, and they typically attempt to explain phenomenal consciousness in terms of intentionality. In an attempt to support their view, they often argue that when we attempt to attend to the phenomenal character of a given phenomenally conscious mental state, we have nothing to attend to except what the mental state represents. In this chapter we\u2019ll consider a thought experiment put forth in an effort to support this claim about attention and its relationship to representationalism. 19 Eloise and the Tree 111 THE CASE Consider Eloise, who is in her front yard looking at an oak tree. As she looks at the canopy of leaves overhead, she is having a visual ex- perience with a greenish character; and, as she touches the bark, she is having a tactile experience with a rough, bumpy character. But now suppose that she tries to attend to her experience, its greenishness say. What happens? Though she is aiming to focus her attention inward, she can\u2019t find any intrinsic features there on which to focus, and her attention slips through to the greenishness of the tree. An attempt to attend inward ends up being an act of outward attention. The color Eloise experiences is experienced as a feature of the tree. There\u2019s nothing special about Eloise and her visual experience, as you can see if you try this attentional task yourself. If there\u2019s no tree nearby, you can just focus on the experience you\u2019re having right now while reading. As you read these words, you\u2019re having an experience of black text against a white background (or, if you\u2019re looking at a screen in dark mode, you\u2019re having an experience of white text against a black background).",

    "question": "What happens if there's no tree nearby when you try to focus on your own experience?",
    "answer": "If there's no tree nearby, you can still try to focus on your own experience. You might find that you're having an experience of the text and background, and if you try to focus on that experience, you might find that it slips through to the actual visual features of the text and background.",
