    "paragraph": " Chapter 29 attempts to get at this contrast by considering two sorts of list. On the one hand, there is a shopping list where the purpose of the list is to get the world\u2014or rather the shopping basket\u2014to reflect what is on the list. On the other hand, there is a receipt, which should be a list that matches what is in the basket. DOI: 10.4324/9781003179191-27 RABBITS AND RABBIT STAGES BACKGROUND Sometimes what we say is ambiguous. When I tell you that I\u2019ve gone to the bank, you might wonder whether I went to a financial insti- tution or to a river. Also, some ordinary terms are vague, e.g., \u201ctall\u201d and \u201cbald.\u201d Even so, often what we say would seem to have deter- minate meaning. For example, suppose I say of my friend Smith, \u201cSmith is tall.\u201d Here \u201cSmith\u201d refers to my friend, even though there are many others who go by the name \u201cSmith.\u201d Also, here \u201cis tall\u201d refers to the property of being tall, even if there is no precise mini- mal height required for being tall. Such claims might seem obviously true\u2014perhaps too obvious to bother stating. Not according to Wil- lard Van Orman Quine. According to Quine, such claims are actually false. In his view, understanding linguistic meaning requires analyzing language from an objective, scientific viewpoint. And that, he holds, involves setting aside our pre-theoretical intuitions about meaning and instead focusing only on objective facts. For example, in the case of translating unknown languages into one\u2019s own language, those ob- jective facts include only dispositions to exhibit verbal behavior in response to external stimuli. As Quine (1987, p. 5) writes: \u201cThere is nothing in linguistic meaning \u2026 beyond what is to be gleaned from 23 CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 140 overt behavior in observable circumstances.\u201d The results of Quine\u2019s influential analysis are startling. Contrary to what might have seemed obvious, what we say generally lacks determinate meaning.",
