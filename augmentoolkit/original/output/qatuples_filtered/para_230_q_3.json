    "paragraph": " Somehow, the mother\u2019s psychology emanates from the teenage body and the daughter\u2019s psychology emanates from the older body. After the swap, viewers find it natural to identify the person in the teenage body as the mother and the person in the older body as the daughter. Despite the intuitive appeal of the memory theory, it has often come in for criticism. One influential criticism, offered in the 18th century by Thomas Reid (1785), proceeds by way of a thought experiment involv- ing a brave army officer. While fighting in an important campaign, this officer saves his entire unit and is awarded a prestigious medal. Though the officer is now highly respected, he was something of a miscreant as a young boy. In particular, he remembers an incident in which he stole some apples from his neighbor\u2019s tree. As the officer ages, he becomes a general, and then retires. In retirement, he gradually becomes more and more senile, and, at a certain point, the retired general can remember winning the medal but can no longer remember stealing the apples or The Prince and the Cobbler 243 anything else from that time of his life. As Reid notes, Locke\u2019s theory now gives us a paradoxical result. To simplify, let\u2019s refer to the retired general as RG, the army officer as AO, and the young boy as YB. Since RG can remember experiences of AO, RG is identical to AO. Since AO can remember experiences of YB, AO is identical to YB. According to the transitivity of identity, if A is identical to B and B is identical to C, then A is identical to C. Putting this together with the two prior claims, we get the result that RG is identical to YB. But, since RG has no memories of the experiences of YB, and since Locke\u2019s memory theory requires such memory connections for personal identity, we also get the result that RG is not identical to YB. Thus, Locke\u2019s memory theory seems to result in a contradiction. RG cannot be both identical to YB and not identical to YB.",

    "question": "What is the transitivity of identity, and how is it related to the paradoxical result?",
    "answer": "The transitivity of identity is the principle that if A is identical to B and B is identical to C, then A is identical to C. This principle is used to derive the paradoxical result that the retired general (RG) is both identical to and not identical to the young boy (YB).",
