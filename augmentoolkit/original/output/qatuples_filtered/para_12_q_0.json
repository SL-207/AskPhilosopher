    "paragraph": " Sally could desire that her mother send money. What makes one state a belief and the other a desire? Can anything general be said about the difference, beyond simply repeat- ing that one is a belief and the other is a desire? Elizabeth Anscombe (1957) suggests (or at least has been taken to suggest) that a key dif- ference is what she calls \u201cdirection of fit.\u201d Her famous case of the shopping list illustrates this concept. THE CASE Imagine a man walking through a grocery store with a shopping list. The list says: cheese, bread, chocolate, grapes \u2026. Following him is a detective who writes her own list, based on what the man bought. Her list says: cheese, bread, chocolate, grapes \u2026. These lists are in some sense exactly the same\u2014they name the same items. But they also 29 The Shopping List 179 differ. The shopper\u2019s list guides the shopper\u2019s actions\u2014to make the list accurate, he must fill his cart with the listed items. The items should match the list. The detective\u2019s list, on the other hand, is meant to re- flect what the shopper bought. The list should match the items. So, suppose that the man gets home and finds that instead of grapes he bought grappa. The shopper can\u2019t fix his mistake by crossing \u201cgrapes\u201d off the list and replacing it with \u201cgrappa.\u201d This would miss the point of the list\u2014to fix the mistake he needs to go back and trade the grappa for the grapes. If the detective, on the other hand, has \u201cgrapes\u201d on her list when the man bought grappa, she can fix the mistake by correcting her list. The point can be glossed by the idea that the lists have different directions of fit. The detective\u2019s list has to fit the way the world turns out to be. The shopper has to make the world fit the list. \u00adAnscombe\u2019s suggestion, then, is that mental states differ in the same way as the lists. Beliefs are like the detective\u2019s list: they aim at match- ing the way the world is. Desires are like the shopper\u2019s list: they aim at making the world match the agent\u2019s representation of it.",
