I might know that I have a cold without under- standing that it is a virus, and could thus imagine having the cold in a world where there were no viruses. Really, though, my imagination is misleading because I don\u2019t know all the relevant facts. Similarly, the soul might in fact be bodily, but the awareness the floating man has of the soul simply doesn\u2019t reveal that fact. Avicenna will respond that, unlike the case of my virus confusion, the floating man fully grasps his own essence. If he can have a com- plete grasp of his essence without needing to think of himself as em- bodied, his essence does not include embodiment. This, though, only raises the question of why we should think the floating man fully grasps his own essence (Adamson and Benevich 2018, pp. 158, 160). It could be that, in his peculiar situation, the floating man is given only a superficial grasp of his own nature and that a more complete grasp would show that he must be embodied. Some philosophers in the latter half of the 13th century (e.g. \u00adMatthew of Aquasparta and Vital du Four) backed off of Avicen- na\u2019s metaphysical conclusion, and instead argued that the case of the \u00adfloating man revealed something special about self-awareness. Even if one must in fact be embodied, one can be aware of oneself without being aware of the body and without having any sensory experience whatsoever (Toivanen 2015, pp. 80\u201386). But even that epistemological conclusion could be challenged. One could maintain in response that the floating man is aware of his body; he just isn\u2019t aware of it as his body. If the soul is material, by being aware of the soul one is aware of one\u2019s material body. Nevertheless, it is plausible that something of the The Floating Man 7 epistemological point remains\u2014that the floating man thought exper- iment might establish an interesting epistemological conclusion.",
