    "paragraph": " In his view, there are probably un- known physical truths that provide the requisite explanatory bridge\u2014 truths that we may well one day discover. Chalmers himself thinks we shouldn\u2019t conclude that the hard prob- lem is insoluble, at least not yet. The nature of the problem places con- straints on a solution: explaining the performance of cognitive functions will never suffice. But that does not entail that no scientific solution is possible. One option is to regard consciousness as a fundamental fea- ture of the universe, alongside the basic posits of physics such as mass and charge. Assuming that mass, charge, etc. are, unlike consciousness, non-mental features; this results in what Chalmers calls naturalistic dual- ism. But Chalmers is open to other options as well, \u00adincluding a view he later dubs \u201cRussellian monism\u201d (1997), in reference to the English phi- losopher Bertrand Russell. According to Russellian monism, although there is again an \u201cextra ingredient\u201d to the universe\u2014something that physical science, as we know it, fails to reveal\u2014that extra ingredient need not be experiential. Instead, it might be \u201cproto-experiential\u201d (or \u201cproto-phenomenal\u201d). On Russellian monism, such proto-\u00adexperiential properties underlie mass, charge, and the other basic properties physics describes (Alter and Pereboom 2023). Other responses are critical of Chalmers\u2019s position. Some deny that there really is a hard problem in addition to the so-called easy prob- lems. Others accept the existence of such an additional hard problem but maintain that it can be accommodated within a standard \u00adphysicalist framework. Chalmers classifies philosophers who give those responses as type-A materialists and type-B materialists, respectively. Some type-A materialists deny that there is a hard problem of consciousness on the grounds that consciousness does not exist: con- sciousness, in the sense that Chalmers intends, is a sort of cognitive illusion (Frankish 2016; and see Chapter 9).",

    "question": "What is Chalmers' view on the hard problem of consciousness, and what possibilities does he consider for a solution?",
    "answer": "Chalmers believes that there are probably unknown physical truths that can provide an explanatory bridge to understanding consciousness. He thinks that we should not conclude that the hard problem is insoluble, at least not yet. Chalmers considers several options, including naturalistic dualism and Russellian monism. He also anticipates other potential responses, such as type-A materialism and type-B materialism.",
