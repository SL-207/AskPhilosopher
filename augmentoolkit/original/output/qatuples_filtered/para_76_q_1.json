    "paragraph": " And the same goes for all other mental states. For example, the concept of belief is characterized in terms of the typical causal role belief plays; and belief itself is identified with whatever state typically plays that role. On analytic functionalism, the explanation of how Martian pain is possible is straightforward. What it means to feel pain, on this view, is to have a state (any state) that plays pain\u2019s characteristic causal role. That causal role is explained in a way that makes no essential refer- ence to human (or non-human) physiology. Marty\u2019s pain is possible because he has states that play that role. Analytic functionalism also delivers an explanation of the possibility of mad pain. The theory identifies pain itself with the state that typically plays pain\u2019s character- istic causal role, relative to some population. Maddy is human, and in humans c-fiber stimulation typically plays that role. Maddy feels pain because she has that neural state, even though in her that neural state does not play its typical causal role. Further, as Lewis explains, analytic functionalism can explain not only mad pain and Martian pain but also mad Martian pain. Mad Martian pain is the Martian version of mad pain, and can be explained in the same way. The mad Martian is a member of the Martian species despite their madness. They feel pain because they have the state that typically plays the relevant causal role in Martians, even though in them that state does not play that role. Key to Lewis\u2019s solution is species (or population) relativity. The states that play the relevant causal role can differ from one species (or population) to the next, as the cases of human pain and Martian pain illustrate. Significantly, although Maddy feels pain, she does so partly in virtue of her membership in the human species. But that aspect of Lewis\u2019s solution can seem implausible. Whether an individual human PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 90 feels pain would seem to be entirely a matter of what is happening in that individual, regardless of how they might relate to others.",
