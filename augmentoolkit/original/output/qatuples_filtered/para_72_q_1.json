    "paragraph": " DISCUSSION Among the many puzzles that synesthesia presents, one concerns the nature of sense perception and the individuation of the senses. How can we make sense of an experience\u2019s being visual in nature rather than auditory or rather than tactile? Some philosophers try to dis- tinguish the senses by way of the sensory organ used; some try to distinguish them in terms of typical (and often proprietary) stimuli. But both of these ways of doing so are challenged by the case of synesthesia. Cyndi need not be using her eyes to \u201csee\u201d red when the bacon sizzles. Moreover, the stimulus she actually senses (the sound of sizzling bacon) is proprietary to audition, while color is proprietary to vision. In response to this puzzle, some researchers have suggested that we need to rethink the way we differentiate the senses from one an- other. Generally speaking, for example, discussions of the senses treat them as relatively discrete systems. As noted by Brian Keeley, \u201cit is common to assume that the different senses are significantly separate and independent of one another\u201d (2002, p. 25). Synesthesia calls this assumption into question. If we were to drop this assumption, then synesthesia would no longer be as puzzling. Dropping this assumption would also enable us to provide a better account of other puzzling phenomena, such as the McGurk effect\u2014a phenomenon in which the same syllable is heard differently depending on the visual input one is having. For example, when one looks at a face making the typ- ical mouth movements associated with \u201cFa,\u201d one will hear the syllable \u201cBa\u201d as \u201cFa\u201d. On this kind of response to the puzzle of synesthesia, rather than thinking of synesthesia as a case where the senses have gotten \u201ccross-wired,\u201d perhaps we should conceive of the senses as not being separately wired in the first place. Synesthesia 221 In addition to presenting a puzzle about the individuation of the senses, synesthesia has also been thought to raise challenges for func- tionalist theories of mind (Gray, 2004).",

    "question": "What is the McGurk effect, and how does it relate to synesthesia?",
    "answer": "The McGurk effect is a phenomenon in which the same syllable is heard differently depending on the visual input one is having. For example, when one looks at a face making the typical mouth movements associated with \"Fa\", one will hear the syllable \"Ba\" as \"Fa\". This phenomenon is similar to synesthesia in that it challenges the idea of separate and independent senses.",
