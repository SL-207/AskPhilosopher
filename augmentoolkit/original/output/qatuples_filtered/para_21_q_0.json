    "paragraph": " For the transparency thesis to support representationalism, it must be interpreted in terms of strong transparency. Because Kind thinks that the strong transparency thesis is false\u2014that experience is only weakly transparent\u2014she concludes that the transparency-based case for representationalism fails. Worries have also been raised about whether the transparency \u00adthesis is meant to be a negative thesis, a positive thesis, or both (see, e.g., Stol- jar 2004). Understood as a negative thesis, the claim that \u00adexperience is transparent would be a claim about what we can\u2019t directly attend to. Un- derstood as a positive claim, it would be making a claim about what we PHYSICALIST THEORIES AND THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND 114 can directly attend to. It looks like the negative claim is required for the representationalist case to go through. Simply claiming that we directly attend to what\u2019s represented does not establish that there is nothing else to attend to. Arguably, the more plausible interpretation of transparency is the positive one. It seems clear that we can directly attend to the tree when attending to our experience of the tree. But if that\u2019s all that transparency amounts to, then it would not provide the support for rep- resentationalism that it is often thought to provide (see Molyneux 2009).
