    "paragraph": " The language you use doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is whether they have a unified enough nature to enter into laws. Now, though, there seems to be a dilemma. Either the special science kinds such as \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201cbelief\u201d are unified enough to be in laws or not. If they are, then there is no problem with there being a kind including them. But Fodor\u2019s own argument insists that they aren\u2019t unified enough to be a kind. The various physical instances of currency are too motley, too disparate to have much in common at all. If that\u2019s the case, though, they seem more like jade\u2014they have too little in common to support lawful generalizations or to support scientific inferences. If this is true, we shouldn\u2019t count these disjunctive kinds as scientific kinds at all, whether in special sciences or physical sciences. In essence, Kim\u2019s point can be put as follows: if special science kinds are too causally heterogeneous to support scientific generalizations, then they cannot support special-science generalizations. Since the motley causal nature of the special science kinds are an essential part of the argument for the autonomy of the special sciences, the autonomy of those sciences comes at the cost of their not being scientific after all. How does this bear on psychology and mental kinds? One way to think of it is to ask whether beliefs are like jade. The argument was supposed to be that beliefs are independent (non-physical) kinds \u00adbecause there can be, for example, human beliefs and robot beliefs The Puzzle of the Special Sciences 81 with very little in common physically. But, if that is the case, we seem to be in a very jade-like situation with beliefs. Beliefs come in two varieties\u2014carbon based and silicon based. We\u2019ve made a lot of \u00adobservations about beliefs in psychology\u2014but they\u2019ve all been about carbon-based beliefs. How much confidence should this give us that these generalizations hold about beliefs in general?",
