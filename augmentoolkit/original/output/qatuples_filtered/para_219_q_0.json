    "paragraph": " And, according to Quine and others, they (and you) would be right to draw those conclusions. DISCUSSION If linguistic meaning is indeterminate, then we ought to reject many propositions that we ordinarily take for granted. For example, ordi- narily we do not think that what we refer to with our words is always indeterminate\u2014as in the example noted above, where I seem to refer determinately to my friend Smith and the property of being tall with the words \u201cSmith\u201d and \u201cis tall.\u201d But appearances can be deceiving, and in this case, according to Quine, they are. Quine\u2019s indeterminacy doctrine has been highly influential. There has also been considerable push-back. Some criticize his argument. One well-known criticism is due to Noam Chomsky (1968). Quine\u2019s CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 142 reasoning begins with a premise about underdetermination: the evi- dence you gather when you observe the tribe member\u2019s reaction to the rabbit doesn\u2019t determine which of your empirical hypotheses about the meaning of \u201cGavagai!\u201d is correct. But, as Chomsky argues, from that premise, Quine\u2019s indeterminacy doctrine simply does not follow. Empirical hypotheses always go beyond the evidence. There are always multiple, inconsistent empirical hypotheses that are consistent with any set of observations. For example, there is an underdetermination by the evidence that physicists consider when they formulate empirical hy- potheses. It does not follow that there is no fact of the matter regarding which hypothesis is correct. Likewise, according to Chomsky, in the case of linguistic meaning, Quine\u2019s premise\u2014that the observable, em- pirical facts are consistent with multiple hypotheses about meaning\u2014 does not entail his indeterminacy of meaning doctrine. In response, Quine could argue that Chomsky\u2019s objection assumes something that Quine rejects from the start: that there is something to the meaning of \u201cGavagai!",

    "question": "If linguistic meaning is indeterminate, what would be the implication for our ordinary understanding of language?",
    "answer": "If linguistic meaning is indeterminate, we would need to reject many propositions that we ordinarily take for granted. This means that we would have to question even our most basic understanding of language, as shown in the example where the speaker seems to refer determinately to their friend Smith and the property of being tall, but according to the doctrine, this is actually an illusion.",
