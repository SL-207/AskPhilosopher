    "paragraph": " And it is not clear how the identity theory or functionalism can account for both possibilities. The identity theory easily accounts for the possibility of mad pain. Maddy feels pain when her c-fibers are stimulated, just like the rest of us\u2014even though her c-fiber stimu- lation is causally connected to other parts of her neural system in atypical ways. But the identity theory seems to exclude the possibility of Martian pain. Marty feels pain but lacks c-fibers. On the identity theory, he can no more experience pain than lightning can occur without electricity or water can exist without hydrogen. Functionalism has the reverse problem. Marty experiences pain be- cause he has states that play that role. That those role-playing states are hydraulic rather than neural is irrelevant. But now the possibility of mad pain would seem to be excluded: none of Maddy\u2019s states play pain\u2019s characteristic causal role. So, how can a physicalist theory account for both the possibility of mad pain (such as Maddy\u2019s pain) and the possibility of Martian pain (such as Marty\u2019s pain)? DISCUSSION Lewis (1966) proposes a solution cast in terms of a physicalist theory known as analytic functionalism (see also Armstrong 1968). This theory Mad Pain and Martian Pain 89 has two main components. One concerns the concept of pain. That concept is characterized in terms of pain\u2019s typical causal role. (That is why the theory is called analytic functionalism: it is partly based on an analysis of mental concepts, such as the concept of pain\u2014or, as it is sometimes put, an analysis of the meaning of mental terms, such as \u201cpain.\u201d) The other main component concerns pain itself. Pain itself is identified with whatever state plays pain\u2019s typical causal role. For example, if in typical humans c-fiber stimulation plays the pain role, then human pain is identical to c-fiber stimulation. And, if in typical Martians a certain hydraulic state plays that role, then Martian pain is identical to that hydraulic state.",

    "question": "What is the main problem for the identity theory when it comes to accounting for both mad pain and Martian pain?",
    "answer": "The main problem for the identity theory is that it seems to exclude the possibility of Martian pain (e.g. Marty's pain) because Marty lacks c-fibers, which are the physical basis for pain in humans. At the same time, the identity theory seems to easily account for mad pain (e.g. Maddy's pain), as Maddy feels pain just like everyone else, even though her c-fiber stimulation is causally connected to other parts of her neural system in atypical ways.",
