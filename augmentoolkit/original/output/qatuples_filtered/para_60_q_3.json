    "paragraph": " And many find the \u00adpossibility of inverted qualia plausible (but see, for example, Speaks 2011). Inverted Qualia 119 Some functionalists respond by denying that inverted qualia are possible (Harman 1982, Lycan 1987). But not all do. Sidney Shoe- maker (1975, 1982) argues instead that the possibility of inverted qualia can be reconciled with functionalism, if functionalism is com- bined with the physicalist view that functional properties are realized in us by brain states. In his view, while the general property of having a conscious experience is a functional property, any specific phenom- enal property we have, such as phenomenal redness, is a neurophysi- ological property. But that strategy faces a problem. As we have seen, the possibility of inverted qualia threatens not just functionalism but physicalism as well (Chalmers 1996). Another noteworthy inversion case is known as Inverted Earth \u00ad(Harman 1982, Block 1990). Inverted Earth differs from Earth in only two ways. First, everything there has the complementary color of its Earthly counterpart. The sky is yellow, ripe bananas are blue, grass is red, fire hydrants are green, etc. Second, the language is inverted. The English-speaking inhabitants describe the sky\u2019s color as \u201cblue,\u201d the color of ripe bananas as \u201cyellow,\u201d etc. Now imagine that evil scientists knock you unconscious, insert color-inverted lenses on your eyes, and transport you to Inverted Earth, where you are substituted for your counterpart. Inverted Earth seems to pose a problem for representationalism, on which qualia are identified with representational properties. When you first wake up on Inverted Earth, everything looks normal to you; the lenses reverse the inverted colors. In terms of qualia, there is no in- version. But what happens regarding what your experiences represent? Suppose you describe the red grass you see as \u201cgreen.\u201d At first, your description would be incorrect.",

    "answer": "Inverted Earth is a hypothetical world that differs from Earth in two ways: everything has the complementary color of its Earthly counterpart, and the language is inverted. For example, the sky is yellow, ripe bananas are blue, grass is red, and fire hydrants are green.",
