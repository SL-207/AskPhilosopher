    "paragraph": ") Is it so strange, though, to say that our representation of the hen is indeterminate? Munton (2021) argues that this only seems strange because we are implicitly accepting a pictorial model of perception, according to which our representation of a scene is like a photograph of it. On this model, it makes sense to represent redness only by, say, representing a particular instance of red in all its determinacy. But, Munton insists, representation is not always like that. We can hope that our team wins without hoping for a particular score. I can remember that I caught a fish on my seventh birthday without remembering the particular kind or size of fish. Perceiving the speckled hen\u2014or really anything complex\u2014is more like this than it is of possessing a mental picture of the hen. If this is plausible, it provides an elegant resolution of the puzzle. Some philosophers prefer to retain the metaphysical portion of the theory of seemings\u2014perhaps along with the implicit pictorialism\u2014but PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND ATTENTION 204 reject its strong epistemological claim (Fantl and Howell 2003). There are determinate mental images on this view, but we can be wrong about their properties. In the case of the hen, we represent it as hav- ing a determinate number of speckles, but we\u2019re fallible about certain features of our representations. This fallibilist position offers a solution to the swatches puzzle as well. S*1 and S*2 are in fact qualitatively distinguishable, but we are fallible about slight qualitative differences in our sensory representations. It might seem, though, that this solution flies in the face of the in- tuitions that made us posit \u201cseemings\u201d in the first place. How can we be wrong about how our seemings seem? Either two things seem the same or they don\u2019t. It is very odd sounding to say that we have mental images that account for how things seem, but that we are wrong about how they seem.",

    "question": "Can you describe a scenario in which we can represent something without necessarily representing every detail of it?",
    "answer": "Yes, I can think of a scenario where I hope that my team wins without specifying a particular score, or where I remember catching a fish on my seventh birthday without remembering the specific kind or size of the fish. In both cases, we're representing a general notion or concept without specifying every detail.",
