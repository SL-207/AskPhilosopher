    "paragraph": " Molyneux\u2019s Problem 187 Very generally, philosophers of an empiricist bent who believe that our ideas and concepts stem from sensory experience alone tend to answer Molyneux\u2019s question in the negative. Because visual and tactile experiences of shape are distinct, and the newly sighted person hasn\u2019t learned to associate the visual experience of shapes with tactile ex- periences of shapes, they would not be able to identify which object was a cube and which was a sphere. Molyneux himself thought this, and Locke and Berkeley agreed. Rationalists like Leibniz, however, answered in the affirmative: given the ability to reason about the sen- sations, the newly sighted person could tell which object was which. Reid in some ways splits the difference. Though the visual and tactile sensations themselves do not resemble each other (or the objects they represent), they give rise to ideas that can be seen to relate to one another (see Van Cleve 2007). More recently, philosophers such as Gareth Evans (1985) and John Campbell (2005) have argued for affirmative answers. According to Evans, both visual and tactile concepts share an egocentric representa- tion of space, depicting things as oriented around the subject, and so a subject should be able to make the transition between them. Accord- ing to Campbell, our experiences are externally individuated\u2014that is, experiences are the same or different based on the properties they represent in the world (see Chapters 19 and 20); and so, if two expe- riences really were of the same property, they would share a way of appearing. Empirical results were brought to bear on Molyneux\u2019s prob- lem surprisingly early. In the early 18th century, William Cheselden wrote about a cataract patient whose sight was restored. According to Cheselden (1728), once vision was restored the patient was unable to distinguish shapes visually, suggesting a negative answer to Molyneux\u2019s question.",
