    "paragraph": " Instead, this puzzle seems to depend on independently plausible and less contentious claims. One is a simple fact about translation: \u201cLondon is pretty\u201d is a translation of \u201cLondres est jolie,\u201d and so those sentences express the same propo- sition. The other is an unobjectionable view about belief ascription: when a subject assents to a sentence \u201cS\u201d and understands what \u201cS\u201d Puzzling Pierre 175 means\u2014namely S\u2014then the subject believes S. It seems we often use these principles implicitly. Suppose John, an English-speaker, sincerely assents to the sentence \u201cLondon is pretty.\u201d It looks like we should say John believes London is pretty. Suppose Jacques, a French-speaker, sincerely asserts to the sentence \u201cLondres est jolie.\u201d It seems we should say Jacques also believes London is pretty. Following the same sorts of principles in the Pierre case leads to the puzzling fact that Pierre be- lieves both that London is pretty and that London is not pretty. There are at least two lessons we can take from Kripke\u2019s example. First, it\u2019s a puzzle: what exactly does Pierre believe? Something seems to have gone wrong here; but what? Second, since it seems puzzles of this sort can be generated without the Millian principle; we might think again about our inclination to reject that principle because of Hespe- rus/Phosphorus cases: they appear to be very similar to the Londres/ London cases, after all, which don\u2019t depend on the Millian principle. If the puzzle raises a general problem for belief ascription, it\u2019s not clear the Millian principle is to blame in Hesperus/Phosphorus cases after all. DISCUSSION Although the literature on Kripke\u2019s puzzle is voluminous and the solu- tions often technical, responses to his puzzle fall into two general camps. In the first camp are those who tend to accept that Pierre, while ra- tional, has contradictory beliefs: he believes London is pretty and he believes London is not pretty.",

    "answer": "What is puzzling is that, following the same principles, we seem to ascribe contradictory beliefs to Pierre: he believes that London is pretty, and he believes that London is not pretty.",
