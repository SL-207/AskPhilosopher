    "paragraph": " 2. The person in the Chinese Room doesn\u2019t understand Mandarin. 3. Thus, strong AI is false. The Chinese Room example also seems to pose a problem to \u00adfunctionalism\u2014a theory of mind that treats mental states as functional states. While we have already seen other problems for functionalism that arise from its inability to handle the phenomenal character of our mental states (see Chapters 15 and 16), this example suggests that functionalism cannot adequately handle the intentional content of our mental states\u2014that is, the aspect of our mental states in virtue of which they are about or directed at objects or states of affairs. One slogan commonly associated with functionalism is that the mind is to the brain as a computer software is to its hardware. In the Chinese Room, however, you are running the right software for understanding Mandarin, but yet you are not in the state of understanding Mandarin. Though Mandarin speakers use these characters to refer to objects or states of affair, to you they are every bit as meaningless after you\u2019ve mastered the rulebook as when you first entered the room. Thus, if this example succeeds, it seems that functionalism must be false. DISCUSSION One common response to the Chinese Room is to argue that Searle was looking for understanding in the wrong place. When strong AI claims that computers can achieve understanding, they attribute the understanding to the entire computing system. But the person inside the room is only one part of the system\u2014there is also the rulebook. Though you may not understand Mandarin as a result of being in the Chinese Room, that does not mean that the whole system lacks such understanding (see Copeland 1993). In terms of the argument out- lined above, premise 1 is rejected. To try to rebut this objection, which The Chinese Room 107 Searle refers to as the Systems Reply, he suggests that the individual in the room could memorize the entire rulebook.",

    "question": "One possible response to the Chinese Room example is to argue that the understanding is not located in the person in the room, but rather in the entire system, including the rulebook. What is the main point of this response?",
    "answer": "The main point of this response is that the person in the room is only one part of the system, and that the understanding can be attributed to the entire system, rather than just the individual in the room. This response is an attempt to reject one of the premises of the argument, specifically the idea that understanding is located solely in the individual.",
