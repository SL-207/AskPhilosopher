    "paragraph": " Kata- lin Balog (1999) responds that the zombie argument cannot be cor- rect. She argues that zombie philosophers could use similar reasoning to show that they themselves have non-physical mental states\u2014and yet, by hypothesis, they do not. She builds her case by developing a thought experiment involving creatures she calls \u201cyogis.\u201d THE CASE The zombie argument against physicalism is based on a thought ex- periment. We are asked to conceive of a world that is physically and functionally the same as the actual world, except no one is conscious. In a zombie world, there is a molecule-for-molecule duplicate of you who is \u201cseeing\u201d worlds indistinguishable from the worlds you\u2019re pres- ently seeing\u2014except they have no inner, subjective life at all. If such a world is conceivable, that is partly because we can refer to our ex- periences directly, rather than via physical or functional descriptions. 8 Yogis 45 For example, we can refer to pain not just as a state that has certain physical causes and physical effects\u2014events that have zombie coun- terparts. We can refer to pain more directly, as a state that feels a certain way\u2014that is, a state with a certain distinctive phenomenal quality. Phenomenal qualities are what the zombie world is supposed to lack. Katalin Balog rejects the zombie argument. To show why we should too, she asks us to imagine a world with people that are much like us, except that some of them are yogis. Just as philosophical zombies are different from the zombies of horror films, philosophical yogis are dif- ferent from the yogis who practice certain forms of eastern religions. Balog\u2019s yogis have a special concept-forming ability. They can detect some of their own brain states in a direct way, without the mediation of any physical or functional description. Indeed, they do not know how they do this. In detecting these brain states, they do not conceive of them as brain states, or as physical or functional states of any kind.",
