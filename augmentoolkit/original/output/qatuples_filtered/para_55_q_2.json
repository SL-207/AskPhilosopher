    "paragraph": " To support that conclusion, David Chalmers considers some \u00adtheories of consciousness that scientists have developed. One is \u00adBernard Baars\u2019 (1988) global workspace theory of consciousness. In this theory, the cognitive system that our brains realize includes a sort of central \u00adprocessor\u2014a global workspace that mediates commu- nication between more specialized processors. Baars uses the model to explain contrasts between conscious and unconscious cognitive functions: information in the global workspace is conscious, while other information is not. Baars\u2019 theory is controversial. But, even if his theory is true, the hard problem isn\u2019t solved. The hard prob- lem isn\u2019t about explaining cognitive functions. One might suppose that all and only conscious experiences (in the relevant what-it\u2019s- like sense) are contents of the global workspace. But the question remains: why are those contents experienced at all? Similar things can be said about other scientific theories of consciousness, such as the theory that certain 35\u201375 hertz neural oscillations in the cerebral cortex are the basis of consciousness (Crick and Koch 1990). Indeed, some such theories aim only to account for the neural correlates of consciousness\u2014the neural processes that accompany all and only conscious experiences. And correlation is not explanation. (Perhaps red cars are more likely to be involved in accidents than non-red cars; that is, perhaps there is a correlation between being a red car and be- ing especially likely to get in an accident. The question remains: why is there that correlation?) The Hard Problem of Consciousness 21 The hard problem concerns scientific explanation. But it gives rise to a challenge to physicalism\u2014the philosophical theory on which no aspect of the mind is over and above the physical. The challenge could be stated roughly as follows. The explanatory gap indicates that con- sciousness is independent of physical phenomena.",

    "question": "What is the challenge to physicalism that arises from the explanatory gap?",
    "answer": "The challenge to physicalism is that the explanatory gap suggests that consciousness is independent of physical phenomena. This means that the existence of consciousness cannot be fully explained by physical laws and processes, and therefore, consciousness cannot be reduced to purely physical phenomena.",
