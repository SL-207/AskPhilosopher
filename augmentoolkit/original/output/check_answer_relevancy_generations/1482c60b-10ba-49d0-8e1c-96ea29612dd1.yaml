- content: 'Text: """ Beliefs and desires are characterized by these differences in
    direction of fit. Other states seem to differ in this way as well. Perceptions
    aim to fit the world, but intentions aim to make the world fit them. DISCUSSION
    Though there is clearly something suggestive about Anscombe’s ex- ample and the
    resulting notion of directions of fit, it has proved to be a little difficult
    to spell out. One famous interpretation and applica- tion of direction of fit
    comes from Michael Smith (1994), who uses it to provide a functionalist account
    of beliefs and desires. On Smith’s model, somewhat roughly: a belief is that p
    is a state that tends to go out of existence when there is a perception that not-p,
    while a desire is that p is a state that endures despite that perception, and
    leads the subject to try to bring it about that p (see also Velleman 2000, p.
    115.). This is a descriptive account of what makes beliefs and desires the states
    that they are. But there are a number of worries about this ac- count, not least
    that beliefs don’t always go out of existence in the face of disagreeing perceptions.
    Some beliefs are stubborn. For example, a mother might believe her son is innocent
    despite mountains of evi- dence that he is not. And some perceptions are properly
    disregarded. CONTENT, INTENTIONALITY, AND REPRESENTATION 180 For example, the
    (illusory) perception that the stick in water is bent has no effect on my belief
    to the contrary (Sobel and Copp 2001, Frost 2014). A natural suggestion here is
    that the direction of fit contrast is not meant to capture how beliefs and desires
    as a matter a fact behave, but how they should behave. Anscombe’s presentation
    of the case suggests that she might have something normative like this in mind.
    Crudely, one might say a subject’s beliefs should represent the world—a sub- ject
    should believe p only if it is true. And desires make normative demands on how
    the subject should interact with the world—if S desires that p, S should try to
    bring it about that p."""


    Question (based on text): """Why might the direction of fit contrast not be meant
    to capture how beliefs and desires actually behave, but rather how they should
    behave?"""


    Supposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking): """The direction
    of fit contrast might be normative, rather than descriptive, in nature. This means
    that it is outlining how beliefs and desires should behave, rather than how they
    actually do behave. For example, a subject''s beliefs should represent the world,
    and a subject''s desires make normative demands on how the subject should interact
    with the world."""
