- content: 'Text: """ For example, can our imaginings distinguish between a 100-sided
    figure and a 1000-sided figure, or is that a difference that can only be represented
    by some other kind of mental capacity? A related issue arises in the thought experiment
    of the speckled hen dis- cussed in Chapter 33: Can your mental image discriminate
    between an image of a hen with 72 speckles and a hen with 73 speckles? The remaining
    chapters in Part IV take up more contemporary issues. In Chapter 34 we consider
    a thought experiment that puts pressure on our standard taxonomy of mental states.
    This thought ex- periment seems to suggest that we need to accept a new category
    of mental states, called aliefs, that have a different kind of content from both
    beliefs and imaginings. In Chapter 35, we consider several thought experiments
    that have been put forth to suggest that percep- tion represents not just low-level
    features such as shape and color but also higher-level features such as being
    a particular kind of tree. The other chapters in Part IV don’t concern thought
    experiments, but rather puzzle cases drawn from real life. In Chapters 36–38,
    we consider three puzzling phenomena relating to perception: synesthesia, change
    blindness, and blindsight. For people who are synesthetes, a sensory stimulation
    typically associated with one perceptual modality will automatically prompt or
    trigger an experience in another percep- tual modality. So, for example, a synesthete
    might experience differ- ent shapes as having distinctive tastes or experience
    different sounds as having distinctive colors. Blindsight is a phenomenon that
    occurs in some cases when an individual’s visual cortex has been damaged. Though
    the individual will report having a part of the visual field in which they can’t
    see anything, when forced to make guesses about ob- jects in that area of the
    visual field, they are able to do so with an accu- racy rate that’s greater than
    chance."""
