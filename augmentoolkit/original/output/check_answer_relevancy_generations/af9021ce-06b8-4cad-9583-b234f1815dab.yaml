- content: 'Text: """ THE CASE Consider a typical synesthete whom we’ll call Cyndi.
    Cyndi has chromesthesia. For her, making breakfast is a very colorful experience.
    When she puts the bacon into the pan and hears the sizzle, she has a sensation
    of red. When she cracks an egg, she has a sensation of blue. And when she pours
    orange juice into a glass, she has a sensation of green. How are we to characterize
    these color experiences? Are they per- ceptual in nature? If so, should we say
    that Cyndi is seeing green or hearing green? Neither of these options seems satisfactory.
    On the one hand, given that colors are typically discriminated vis- ually, it
    may seem tempting to say that Cyndi is seeing green as she’s pouring the orange
    juice. But there is nothing green in her visual field. Her eyes may even be closed
    while she is having the relevant experience. Moreover, given that her color experience
    is caused by Synesthesia 219 an auditory stimulus, it may seem odd to characterize
    her perceptual experience as something that’s visual in nature. One way that we
    dis- tinguish auditory experiences from visual experiences is in terms of the
    kinds of inputs that generate the relevant experience. In Cyndi’s case, there
    is not the kind of input typical of visual experiences. In this case, the input
    is auditory in nature. That suggests that we should say she is hearing the color.
    And in fact, this is how synesthesia is often described, as in neurologist Rich-
    ard Cytowic’s 1998 book titled, The Man Who Tasted Shapes (see also Brang and
    Ramachandran 2011). But it’s not clear how we are to make sense of the claim that
    colors can be heard. Given the nature of colors, they are not the kinds of experiences
    that can be discrim- inated from one another by way of auditory perception. All
    of their properties are visual in nature (hue, brightness, etc.). They do not
    have auditory properties (volume, tone, etc.). So, it’s hard to know how to classify
    Cyndi’s perceptual experience."""

    she is hearing the color?"""


    Supposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking): """Yes,
