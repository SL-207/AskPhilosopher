    ELOISE AND THE TREE BACKGROUND Many of our mental states have intentional content.
    Intentionality in the relevant sense doesn’t have to do with having an intention
    or doing something intentionally, but rather with representational content. The
    notion is often characterized in terms of “aboutness” or “directedness.” For example,
    my belief that Mike Trout plays for the Los Angeles Angels is about a particular
    person, Mike Trout, and a certain state of affairs—his playing for that particular
    baseball team. My belief represents, or is directed at, those things."""


    Question (based on text): """What is the concept of "directedness" in the context
    of intentional content?"""


    Supposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking): """In the
    context of intentional content, "directedness" refers to the idea that mental
    states have a certain content or meaning that they are representing or directed
    at. This can be thought of as the "aboutness" of a mental state, where the state
    is about a particular person, object, or state of affairs."""
